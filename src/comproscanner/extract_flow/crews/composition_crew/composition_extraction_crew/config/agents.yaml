    {expected_composition_property_example}

    or else, if the any composition has variable (x,y,z etc.) values, for e.g. 0.5NaNbO3 and (1-x) Na0.2K0.3Bi0.5TiO3-xNaNbO3, where x=0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 and y=0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.1, then in the following manner-
    {expected_variable_composition_property_example}

    If, any abbreviation is present with the composition, create another key with the abbreviation (It must be in all CAPITAL letter) and full composition, for e.g.-
    "abbreviations": {{
      "g-CN": "g-C3N4",
    }}
    *Abbreviation Note*:
    - DON'T consider greek letters for abbreviation, for e.g. Î± or \u03b1 should not be taken as 'alpha'.
    - DON'T consider any chemical composition in english word, for e.g. ZnO should not be taken as 'zinc oxide'.
    - FOCUS on abbreviations with all CAPITAL letters. They MUST be considered.
