        "The calcined powders were ground and sieved using a mesh with a size of 63 µm.",
        "For dense BCZT ceramics: The BCZT powders were mixed with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and uni-axially cold-compacted at a pressure of 80 MPa to form the green body.",
        "The green body was heated to 500 °C for 2 h using a ramp rate of 1 °C/min to burn out the organic agents.",
        "The green body was then sintered at 1400 °C for 10 h with a ramp rate of 5 °C/min.",
        "For porous BCZT ceramics: The BCZT powders were ball milled for 24 h with deionized water, PVA, and ammonium polyacrylate to form a slurry with a solid loading level of ~20 vol%.",
        "The slurry was poured into a cylindrical mold with PDMS on the sides and high thermal conductivity metal on the bottom.",
        "The slurry was unidirectionally frozen at -80 °C, and the ice was removed by freeze drying to form a porous BCZT green body.",
        "The green bodies formed by freeze-casting were sintered at the same conditions as the dense BCZT."
