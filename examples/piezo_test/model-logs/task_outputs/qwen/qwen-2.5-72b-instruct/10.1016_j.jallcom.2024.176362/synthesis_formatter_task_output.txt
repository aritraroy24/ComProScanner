The ratio of materials to balls to water is 1:2:1.","After ball milling, the powder was pressed into blocks and calcined at 850 °C for 2 hours.","The calcined powder was then ball-milled for 12 hours again to obtain uniform PMS-PZT powder.","Dried powder combined with binders PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) was pressed into pellets of a diameter of 20 mm and a thickness of 1.4 mm at a pressure of 7 MPa.","The green bodies were heated at 550 °C for 3 h to remove the PVA.","Then all the green bodies were sintered at 1250 °C for 2 h in a sealed alumina crucible with the same composition powder in the surface of the disks to minimize the evaporation of PbO.","After cooling down, the sintered ceramics were ground into a thickness of 1 mm.","Silver electrodes were fired on the top and bottom surfaces of the ceramics at 720 °C for 20 min.","Then all the ceramics were poled in silicon oil at 130 °C for 40 minutes under an DC electric field of 35 kV/mm.","The polarized ceramics were aged for at least 24 hours at room temperature before testing its piezoelectric properties."],"characterization_techniques":["XRD","SEM","TF 2000 analyzer","quasi-static piezoelectric d33 meter","impedance analyzer","AFM"]}}
