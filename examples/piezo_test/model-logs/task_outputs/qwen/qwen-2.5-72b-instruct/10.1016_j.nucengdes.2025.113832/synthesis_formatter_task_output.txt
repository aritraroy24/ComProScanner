{"synthesis_formatted_data":{"method":"Diffusion Bonding","precursors":["PZT ceramic discs","Nickel wear plates","Silver"],"steps":["Commercial PZT ceramic discs of grade SP-6 were sourced and measured 20 mm in diameter and 2 ± 0.04 mm in thickness.","Both sides of the PZT discs were coated with silver using screen printing with a proprietary silver paste, followed by firing at approximately 800°C in air to achieve a final silver coating thickness of around 25 μm.","The quality of the bond between the screen-printed silver electrodes and PZT discs was assessed using ultrasonic C-scan imaging.","Nickel wear plates, each 2 mm thick, were machined from Ni-200 rods and ground to achieve a planarity of approximately 10 μm and a roughness of about 1 μm.","The Ni wear plate was first coated with silver using a DC sputtering process to a thickness of about 6 μm, followed by heating the coated surface in flowing hydrogen gas at 700 °C for 2 h to facilitate the diffusion of silver into the nickel and establish a solid solution.","An additional silver coating of about 3 μm thickness was applied, bringing the overall thickness of Ag coating on the nickel wear plate to approximately 9 μm.","The PZT discs and nickel wear plates were placed in a vessel with a 10 mm thick plate and a special slot for positioning a sample holder, which was evacuated to a high vacuum of less than -10^-2 Pa.","The vessel was heated up to 700 °C using a split furnace, and a uniaxial press applied a predetermined pressure (up to 40 MPa) on the bonding components while maintaining the vacuum inside the vessel.","Two different bonding temperatures were used: 275 °C (below the Curie temperature, Tc, of PZT) and 400 °C (above Tc). A bonding pressure of 20 MPa was used, and the bonding duration was set to 1 h.","In cases 1 & 2, a 1 μm thick silver coating was applied over the screen-printed silver layer on the PZT disc using DC magnetron sputtering.","In cases 3 & 4, the screen-printed silver coating on the PZT disc was removed, and a ~10 μm silver was applied. After each 3 μm layer of silver was deposited, the disc was heated to 800 °C to ensure adhesion of the silver to the PZT disc.","Initially, a load of approximately 1 MPa was applied to the components, followed by evacuation of the vessel to less than -10^-2 Pa. The furnace was then put on, and once the desired temperature was reached, the final load of 20 MPa was applied.","After maintaining the components under this pressure for 1 h, the furnace was turned off, and the vessel was allowed to cool to room temperature.","The PZT discs that met the quality standards were subjected to thermal cycles between 250 °C and room temperature in air. Each cycle involved heating the PZT disc bonded to the nickel wear plate to 250 °C at a rate of 3 °C per hour, holding at that temperature for 2 h, and then furnace cooling to room temperature.","The d33 values were measured before and after the thermal cycling, and C-scan imaging of the bond was performed at the end of the first and 10th cycles.","For PZT discs bonded at 400 °C, repoling was performed using a DC poling unit. The PZT discs were immersed in dry silicone oil maintained at 150 °C, and a DC potential of 15 kV was applied across the disc for 15 min."],"characterization_techniques":["Ultrasonic C-scan imaging","Piezometer System (Model PM100, Piezotest, UK)","Bessel band-pass filter","Transducer characterization system (Model TraCSS®, Dhvani make, India)","X-ray diffraction (XRD)","Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)","Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)","Raman spectroscopy"]}}
