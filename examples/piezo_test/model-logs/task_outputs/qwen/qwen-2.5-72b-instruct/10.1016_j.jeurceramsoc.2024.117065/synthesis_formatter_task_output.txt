For CaBi2Nb2O9 ceramics, the sintering was done at 1150 °C for 3 hours, while thulium-substituted CBN ceramics were sintered at temperatures ranging from 1100 to 1140 °C for 3 hours.","Textured ceramics were prepared using a two-step sintering method with a spark plasma sintering (SPS) system. Initially, the CBN-100xTm powders were placed into a graphite die with an inner diameter of 10 mm and heated to 990 °C for 3 minutes at a heating rate of 100 °C/min under a constant load of 60 MPa, forming a fully densified block.","This block was then deformed in another graphite die with a larger inner diameter of 20 mm at 1130 °C for 5 minutes under a constant load of 40 MPa. The heating rate for this step remained 100 °C/min.","After sintering, the samples were annealed in a muffle furnace at 1000 °C for 4 hours in air to remove any infiltrated carbon."],"characterization_techniques":["XRD","SEM","PFM","impedance analyzer","quasi-static d33 meter","ferroelectric analyzer"]}}
