{"synthesis_formatted_data":{"method":"DC reactive magnetron sputtering","precursors":["Al","N2","Ar","Si"],"steps":["AlN thin films were deposited by DC reactive magnetron sputtering from a 100 × 300 mmE^2 Al target (99.99 % purity) using N2 and Ar as process gases.","The layers were deposited on 0.80-inch single side polished (100)-oriented Si substrates.","Prior to each deposition, substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic cleaning system consisting in a series of ultrasonic baths: (i) 5 minutes in Decon neutracon® solvent; (ii) 5 minutes in WashBryte® solvent; (iii) 5 minutes in deionized (DI) water.","Finally, substrates were dried under N2 flow and loaded into the deposition system under a residual pressure around 10E^-7 mbar, to prevent air contamination.","Prior to each deposition, and with the shutter covering the substrate set in close position, the Al target was cleaned in pure Ar (flow of 30 sccm) at 300 W for 10 min to remove potential oxygen contamination from the surface.","This was followed by 5 min carried out in a reactive atmosphere (i.e., Ar/N2 plasma) to reach stable reactive conditions of the plasma, similar to that used during the depositions.","AlN thin films were deposited using magnetron powers of 70 and 400 W, and Ar & N2 flows of 20 and 40 sccm limits."],"characterization_techniques":["profilometry","SEM","EDX","XRD","TEM","STEM EDX","Berlincourt method"]}}
