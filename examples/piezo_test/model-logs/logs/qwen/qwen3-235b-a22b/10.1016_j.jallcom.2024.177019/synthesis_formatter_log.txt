Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'solid-state reaction', 'precursors': ['Nd2O3', 'Bi2O3', 'Sc2O3', 'PbO', 'TiO2'], 'steps': ['Ball-milled in ethanol medium with zirconia balls for 24 h', 'Dried in oven', 'Calcined at 850 °C for 3 h', 'Additional 12 h ball milling in ethanol', 'Dried and granulated with 5 wt% polyvinyl alcohol', 'Sieved through 80-mesh screen', 'Uniaxially dry pressed into pellets (10 mm diameter, 1.5 mm thickness)', 'Sintered at 3 °C/min to 1120-1200 °C for 2 h in ambient air after binder removal at 550 °C'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'SEM', 'd33 meter', 'Ferroelectric analyzer', 'LCR meter']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
