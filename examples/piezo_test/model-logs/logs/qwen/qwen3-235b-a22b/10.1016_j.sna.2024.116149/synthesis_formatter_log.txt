Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': '', 'precursors': [], 'steps': ['PIMNT samples were sliced into 5×5×0.5 mm³ wafers', 'Silver electrodes were painted onto sample surfaces', 'Electrodes were fired at 750 °C for 30 minutes to form electrodes', 'Samples were poled with an electric field of 10 kV/cm at 140 °C for 15 minutes in silicone oil', 'Samples were slowly cooled to room temperature while the electric field was halved'], 'characterization_techniques': ['d33 meter', 'Impedance Analyzer', 'Ferroelectric Analyzer']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
