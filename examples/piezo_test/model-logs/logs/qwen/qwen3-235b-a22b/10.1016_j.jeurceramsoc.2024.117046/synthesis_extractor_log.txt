The piezoelectric properties of PZT piezoelectric materials and 1\u20133 type piezoelectric composites can be calculated by the resonance-antiresonance method from the impedance characteristics of various resonators. The impedance characteristics of piezoelectric materials were calculated and analyzed using PZflex software (Weidlinger Associates, Inc., Mountain View, CA) , a commercial finite element analysis program. The piezoelectric material within various porosity for the simulation and experiment was chosen as modified PZT8(KICET-PZT8) , which is a PZT whose mechanical quality(Qm) value was improved by doping manganese to PZT8, a general hard PZT. For the simulation, the material properties of KICET-PZT8, according to the porosity obtained in our previous study , were utilized as the equivalent properties of the piezoelectric material, and are shown in. The model of the 1\u20133 type piezoelectric composite for the simulation was depicted as shown in. In the figure, red parts represents PZT, and green parts represents polymer. 'Kerf' refers to the distance between the PZT pillar and the adjacent PZT pillar. In this model, the volume ratio of the piezoelectric composite was adjusted between 10 % and 50 % by altering the pillar width (W) and kerf, and the impedance characteristics of the composite were examined. As illustrated in , the HFOM (hydrostatic figure of merit, d h\u2219 g h) value was determined by simulating both the Length-Extensional(LE) mode and the Length-Thickness- Extensional(LTE) mode for each volume ratio of the PZT-polymer composite. The 1\u20133 type porous PZT-polymer composite in this study was fabricated using the Ceramic Injection Molding (CIM) method. The CIM feedstock is composed of ceramic powder, which determines the physical and chemical properties of the product, and a binder system that provides fluidity to the ceramic powder. The piezoelectric feedstock in this study used a binder system consisting of KICET-PZT8 piezoelectric powder, paraffin wax, and ethylene-vinyl-acetate(EVA). The preform of the 1\u20133 type composite was fabricated using a ceramic injection molding (CIM) machine (NEX-500, NISSEI Japan) with the prepared feedstock. The CIM machine and mold used for injection of porous 1\u20133 type PZT composite preform are shown in. After sintering the PZT composite preform at 1250 \xb0C for 2 h, a polymer (301, EPOTEK) was poured into it. The polymer-poured specimens were cured at 80\xb0C for 12 h, and the final cured specimens were machined into shapes optimized by simulation. Room-temperature-curing silver electrodes were applied to the machined specimens, and polarization was performed by applying an electric field of 2.5 kV/mm for 20 min in a silicone oil bath at 120\xb0C, following the polarization conditions typical of PZT-8 ceramics.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
As shown in , the permittivity, d31, and d33 characteristics are required to calculate the HFOM characteristics. shows the d31, d33 characteristics and the HFOM characteristics according to PZT volume fraction of composite calculated using FEM. In , d33 and d31 tend to decrease as the porosity increases. As the PZT volume fraction in the composite increases, d33 increases, but d31 tends to decrease. In particular, (a) shows that the d33 value does not change much as the porosity increases from 0 % to 7 %. This is because the d33 value of PZT generally does not vary significantly with porosity. However, as the porosity increases, d31 and permittivity decrease significantly, which ultimately contributes to the increase in the dh and gh values. Additionally, at a porosity of 7 %, the d33 value remains relatively unchanged. This is likely due to the characteristic of PZT, where the d33 value is largely unaffected, and the polymer penetrates into the surface pores, partially suppressing their function as pores. In (b), both d33 and d31 decrease more significantly for porosities greater than 7 %, likely due to the formation of additional internal pores. This is consistent with the previously reported behavior of 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite. However, when the PZT volume fraction exceeds 40 %, d31 tends to increase again, assuming porosity is 0 %. In the 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite, the polymer plays a role in suppressing the lateral action of PZT. As the volume fraction of PZT increases, the lateral action of PZT exceeds the polymer's ability to suppress it beyond a certain volume fraction. This finding is generally consistent with the research results that the HFOM has the maximum value at 15\u201330 % of the PZT rod volume fraction of 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite. Unlike dense PZT (porosity 0 %), the HFOM value of porous PZT increases as the volume fraction of the composite PZT rod increases. This is because the d31 of the composite decreases when porous PZT is used. In the case of a porous PZT rod, it can be seen as a piezoelectric composite with 3\u20133 or 0\u20130 connectivity, which reduces the lateral piezoelectric action of the overall 1\u20133 type composite. Therefore, the d31 value decreases despite a relatively high PZT volume fraction compared to dense PZT. As a result, the effect of d33 (thickness direction action) steadily increases according to the volume fraction, but the effect of d31 (lateral action) steadily decreases due to the additional suppression of the pores inside the porous PZT. This results in a higher HFOM value compared to the dense 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite. As shown in (c), in the case of composites with porosity of 7 % and 13 %, the HFOM value shows a high value of 3000(10E^{\u221215} Pa) or more from 30 % or more of the PZT volume fraction. Also, in (d), the ratios of d33 to d31 increase along with the increase in the PZT ratio of the composite at a porosity of 7 % and13 %. In particular, at 50 % of the PZT volume fraction, the HFOM value shows a high value of about 4000(10E^{\u221215} Pa). However, as the volume fraction of PZT increases in the fabricating process, there is a risk of internal defects in the green body due to increased friction with the mold and deformation during sintering, which increases the cost of the process. Therefore, in this study, the PZT volume fraction was determined to be 30 % In the 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite, the aspect ratio of the PZT rod greatly influences the coupling factor in thickness direction (kt), which directly affects warpage during sintering or piezoelectric conversion efficiency Therefore, it is important to select the aspect ratio of the PZT rod for the design of the 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite. Based on the PZT volume fraction (30 %) of the composite selected in , the aspect ratio of the PZT rod was varied, and the corresponding kt value was calculated with following equation;  shows the amount of change in the kt value according to the aspect ratio. When the porosity is 0 % and 7 %, the aspect ratio increases rapidly between 3 and 4 and gradually increases without a significant change above 5. However, when the porosity is 13 %, the kt value gradually increases without a radical change and converges when the aspect ratio is 4. It seems that the piezoelectric effect (subscript t) in the thickness direction of the composite becomes closer to the longitudinal direction (subscript 33) because the propensity of each PZT rod becomes closer to the LE mode as the aspect ratio increases. In addition, for single phase porous PZT ceramics, the kt value is known to increase as porosity increases. As shown in , for porous 1\u20133 PZT-polymer composites, the kt value rises up to a porosity of 7 %, following the trend observed in previous studies, but it suddenly decreases at 13 % porosity. This is because, in the case of porous PZT, only air or voids exist in the pores, which does not affect the connectivity of the PZT. However, in porous 1\u20133 PZT-polymer composites, the polymer penetrates the open pores of the PZT, reducing its connectivity, which increases impedance and decreases the frequency bandwidth in the thickness direction. Therefore, in composites with 7 % or more porosity, the polymer that infiltrates the open pores extending to the surface or interior is likely to affect piezoelectric performance. Therefore, for the shape to be used in this study, the PZT volume fraction is set to 30 %, and the aspect ratio is set to 4 according to the results of. shows the microstructure of green body of porous 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite preform. Based on the observed microstructure, it is evident that polystyrene (PS) does not melt and retains its original shape well, even when injection is performed at a relatively high temperature (approximately 180\u2103). This phenomenon is similar to that of PMMA, which is used as a medium for pore generation when fabricating bulk-type specimens through the press process. As expected, PS has a higher melting point than PMMA and is therefore expected to maintain its shape even at high temperatures during injection. shows the microstructure of sintered porous 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite preform. From , it is evident that the PS retained its shape sufficiently and burned out during the sintering process, resulting in successful pore formation. This can be attributed to the fact that PS has a higher boiling point (430\u2103) compared to other paraffin wax (300\u2103) and EVA (170\u2103) used in the feedstock. The size of the pores observed on the microstructure was \u223c30 \xb5m on average, and it can be seen that they have a uniform size without significant differences depending on the porosity. The hydrostatic properties (dh, gh) of the fabricated specimen were analyzed using a dh-meter (PM-300H, Piezotest), with providing a schematic of the measuring device. The measurement works by applying 110 Hz low-frequency air pressure to a specimen sealed in a container, recording the internal charge produced, and determining the values for dh and the dielectric constant. shows a micro porous PZT rod of the fabricated piezoelectric composite. Each composite was fabricated with PZT rod porosity of 0, 3, 5, 8, 10 and 12, and its characteristics are shown in in comparison with simulation calculation results. In the case of the fabricated porous 1\u20133type PZT-polymer composite, the HFOM value is the highest at 4050(10\u201315 Pa) at 12 % porosity, and the result increases as the porosity increases. In addition, the HFOM values obtained by the experiment show the same tendency as the simulation calculation result as a whole, but show a slight error in the absolute value over the porosity of 5 %. The simulation and experimental results showed a difference of about 12\u201317 % from porosity of 7\u201313 %. This is presumed to be because the material properties of the actual porous PZT rod were changed as the polymer penetrated the surface of the porous PZT rod. In addition, the material properties used for simulation in this study were obtained by assuming equivalent material properties in bulk shape specimens without considering the actual pore size and shape of porous PZT. Therefore, in the case of a 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite with a large aspect ratio and a large number of rods, it is highly likely that the pores in the PZT rods are distributed in more diverse shapes and sizes. Considering these variables, it is judged that the predicted and designed values through simulation and the properties of the actually fabricated 1\u20133 type piezoelectric composite show an acceptable degree of error. In addition, it was confirmed that a porous 1\u20133type PZT-polymer composite with a relatively higher HFOM value than the existing 1\u20133type PZT-polymer composite was successfully fabricated.
