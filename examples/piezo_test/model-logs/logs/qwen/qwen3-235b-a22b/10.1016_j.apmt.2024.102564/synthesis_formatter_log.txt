Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'spin-coating', 'precursors': ['L-phenylalanyl-L-leucine', 'L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine'], 'steps': ['Preparation of dipeptide solution in methanol (1 mg/mL)', 'Deposition of 10 μL solution onto a silicon substrate', 'Solvent removal via spontaneous evaporation, forced drying with warm air, or spin-coating at 3000 rpm', 'Saturation of the film with methanol vapor (P/P0=1) in a sealed Petri dish for 10 minutes to 24 hours at room temperature', 'Post-saturation drying with warm air at 45°C'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'Raman spectroscopy', 'AFM', 'PFM']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
