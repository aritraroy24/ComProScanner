**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'solid-state reaction', 'precursors': ['Pb3O4', 'SrCO3', 'MgO', 'Nb2O5', 'TiO2', 'ZrO2', 'MnCO3'], 'steps': ['Mix raw materials according to stoichiometric ratio and accurately weigh', 'Ball mill for 18 h', 'Dry powder and calcine at 850 °C for 3 h', 'Add MnCO3 and ball mill for 18 h', 'Use polyvinyl butyral as a binder to press powder into disks (10 mm diameter)', 'Remove organics at 600 °C for 3 h', 'Sinter at 1150–1250 °C for 3 h', 'Coat both sides of sintered samples with silver electrodes and heat at 550 °C for 30 min', 'Polarize in 150 °C silicone oil with 3 kV/mm direct current electric field for 35 min'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'SEM', 'LCR meter', 'Ferroelectric test system', 'XPS', 'd33 meter', 'Impedance analyzer']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
