Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'CVD', 'precursors': ['Ca2B6O11·5H2O', 'Fe2O3', 'BaCO3', 'TiO2'], 'steps': ['1 g colemanite, 80 mg Fe2O3, 500 mg BaCO3, and 500 mg TiO2 were mixed', 'mixture subjected to ball milling for 15 h at 300 rpm', '2 mL of 13.8 M ammonia solution added and ball-milled for 3 min', 'mixture transferred onto a silicon carbide plate (3 cm × 2 cm)', 'ammonia solution evaporated by heating on a hot plate at 150 °C', 'SiC plate placed in a tubular furnace, heated to 1300 °C under NH3 gas flow, and maintained for 3 h', 'NH3 gas flow stopped at 975 °C, furnace cooled to room temperature'], 'characterization_techniques': ['SEM', 'TEM', 'AFM', 'FTIR', 'Raman Spectroscopy', 'XRD', 'PFM']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
