Solid solutions of the two ferroelectric ceramic system (1-x)PbTiO3- (x)Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 [PT-BNH] and (1-x)PbTiO3-(x)BiScO3 [PT-BS] were prepared using solid-state synthesis technique. Ultra high-purity analytical-reagents (AR) grade Bi2O3 (99 %, Alfa-Aesar), PbO (99.9 % Alfa-Aesar), NiO (99 %, Alfa-Aesar), HfO2 (99.9 % Alfa-Aesar), Sc2O3 (99.99 % Alfa-Aesar) and TiO2 (99.8 %, Alfa-Aesar) chemicals were mixed homogenously for 12 hours duration as per stoichiometric ratios using a planetary ball mill with zirconia jar and zirconia balls in presence of acetone as milling agents (Fritsch P5). The homogenous mixed powder was calcined at temperature of around 900 \xb0C for 5 hours. Then the pure phase calcined powder was mixed with an organic binder made from a 3 wt% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution in deionized water and pressed in the form of pellets of 12 mm and 14 mm diameter using uniaxial pressure die at 100 MPa. Then these green pellets were sintered at an elevated temperature of 1190 \xb0C for 2 hours inside a muffle furnace by sealing it inside a alumina crucible using MgO and using pre calcined as a spacer powder. The sintered pellet was crushed and annealed at 600 \xb0C for 4 hours to remove any effect of mechanical strains acquired during the crushing process and then analyzed using X-ray diffraction. This analysis was performed on Rigaku (SMART LAB) diffractometer equipped with a Johansson-monochromator to exclude Cu-K2 radiation from the input x-ray beam; structural characterization was carried out utilizing X-ray diffraction (XRD) for powder in Bragg-Brentano reflection geometry. Structure refinement was performed using FULLPROF software. A scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL) was used to examine the microstructure. Dense sintered pellets were covered with silver paste to create electrodes and baked at 250 \xb0C for 45 minutes for poling to investigate the electric field induced phase transition. Silver coated/polished ceramic pellets were polarized in silicone oil bath at room temperature for 1 hour by applying a DC electric field of 40 kV / cm. For understanding the effect of electric field poling on structural phase, poled pellets were grounded gently into fine powder and XRD data was collected to examine for phase transformation, if any. Using the piezo test PM-300, the longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient (d33) was determined after poling the pellets at room temperature for 1 hour at a DC-electric field of 40.0 kV/cm. Novocontrol (Alpha-A USA) impedance analyzer was used for dielectric dispersion and permittivity measurement. Using the 532 nm line of an Ar + ion laser as the excitation source line, Raman spectra of the unpolled composition at room temperature were recorded from 50 cmE^{\u22121} to 1000 cmE^{\u22121}on a LabRam HR multi-channel spectrometer fitted with a microscope. Raman data was collected under an x50 microscope in a micro-Raman backscatter configuration with a laser spot size of 1 \u03bcmE^{2}. The pair distribution function was derived using the PDFgetX3 software using total X-ray scattering data acquired at DESY's PETRA III powder diffraction synchrotron beam line P02.1 with an incoming beam intensity of 60 keV.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The gradual evolution of the pseudocubic {111}pc, {200}pc and {220}pc Bragg peaks profiles of (1-x)PbTiO3-(x)BiScO3 (0.36\u2264x \u22640.40) with composition (x) is shown in (a). The Bragg intensity of the rhombohedral / monoclinic phase is pronounced at x = 0.365. At x = 0.365, the rhombohedral / monoclinic phase's Bragg intensity is very strong, with increase in BiScO3 concentration (x), the height or intensity of the monoclinic peak steadily grows. For composition with x = 0.39, the monoclinic peaks dominate the pattern and the tetragonal peaks in the tail or background region are barely visible. Complete pattern fitting of XRD data was performed using the Rietveld method using a tetragonal (P4mm) + monoclinic (Cm) average structure. It should be observed that the compositions x = 0.40 and x = 0.36 appear to be pure rhombohedral / monoclinic and tetragonal phases, respectively, but the structural model fit was enhanced when the second sub phase or minor phase was included. Similarly, we have present Bragg peak profile of (1-x)PbTiO3-(x)Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 (0.35\u2264x\u22640.42) with composition (x) respectively in (b). The {111}pc profile remains singlet in all compositions and indicates the CL phase. Based on this visual examination of the Bragg profile, the overall pattern fit of the XRD data was performed using the Rietveld method with a tetragonal (P4mm) + cubic (Pm3\u0305m) average structure. It should be emphasized that the cubic (Pm3\u0305m) structure used here is for convenience only and does not represent the true structure, as will be disclosed in the following section. These two structural phase coexistence models of (P4mm) + cubic (Pm3\u0305m) fits the data very well. It can note that although the components x = 0.40, 0.42 and x = 0.35 appeared as pure and quaternary CL, respectively, the fit improved as the phase the second smallest is included in the structural model. (a) and 2 (d) shows the composition dependence lattice parameters of PT-BS and PT-BNH systems. As it can be seen clearly in (a), Lattice parameters \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 increases while \u2018c\u2019 decreases for monoclinic with increase in x (composition), similarly with increasing x, the tetragonal 'a' parameter grows, whereas the 'c' parameter decreases. While in (d) tetragonal \u2018a\u2019 parameter increases, and the \u2018c\u2019 parameter decreases with increasing x. This becomes more apparent with tetragonal (c / a) compositional changes ((b) and 2 (e)). SEM micrograph of PT-BS with x = 0.3725 and PT-BNH with x = 0.39 are shown in (a) and 3 (b) respectively. The average grain size was found to approximately (4\u20135 \xb5m) for these sample. Short correlation length is the indication of presence of nano polar region which is well known in the case of relaxor ferroelectric similar to PT-BNH system to show high piezoelectric property. Thus an optimum coherent length results in like high piezoelectricity. (c, f) depicts that variation of longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) of PT-BS and PT-BNH with composition. It is evident from (c, f) that d 33 drastically enhanced in the intermediate composition range decreasing on each side of the MPB, demarcating the MPB area. In the unpoled state of the PT-BNH for the x = 0.39 (large piezoelectric response) tetragonal and cubic similar phases coexist, similar to ordinary MPB systems of PT-BS, where the phase coexistence of tetragonal and rhombohedral/monoclinic regions, there is a strong piezoelectric response. Except for PT-BNZ and PT-BS , this d 33 value is comparable or higher than that of several other reported Bi/Pb-based MPB solid solutions such as 0.63Bi(Mg1/2Ti1/2)O3-0.37PbTiO3 , 0.51Bi(Ni1/2Ti1/2)O3-0.49PbTiO3 , 0.38Bi(Mg3/4W1/4)O3-0.62PbTiO3 , 0.35Bi(Ni2/3Nb1/3)O3-0.65PbTiO3. (a, c) shows the electric field driven phase transformations in PT-BS and PT-BNH. To study the effect of electric field in PT-BS and PT-BNH, pellets of various compositions of PT-BS and PT-BNH were poled at 40 kV/cm on silicon oil bath at room temperature. The poled pellets were crushed into fine powders and XRD pattern was recorded. We have observed from (a) {002}pc/{200}pc XRD profiles which appear to be triplet for the composition with x = 0.3725 in the unpoled state [ (left panel)] unpoled state does not fully transform into tetragonal phase with fraction of rhombohedral phase still persisting after applied electric field. Similarly, the {111}pc XRD peak remains doublet reveals the rhombohedral/monoclinic phase. For the MPB compositions with x = 0.365 \u2013 0.39, similar trend obtained for unpoled and poled samples. As can be seen from (c) that {002}pc/{200}pc XRD profiles which appear to be singlet for the composition with x = 0.40 in the unpoled state [ (right panel)] splitted into two peaks after applied electric field. The {111}pc XRD peak is remain singlet reveals the tetragonal structure for x = 0.40. For the MPB compositions with x = 0.36 \u2013 0.39, similar trend obtained for poled samples. Pseudocubic reflections {200}pc which have triplet nature (for x = 0.36\u20130.39) in unpoled state [ (right panel)] transform in tetragonal phase with doublet {002}pc/{200}pc reflections. (b) and 4 (d) shows the variation of tetragonality (c/a) of poled samples on application of electric field. The tetragonality of poled samples is higher than that of annealed samples of PT-BNH, while no significant changes in tetragonality is observed after poling in conventional PT-BS (MPB) systems. (a) and (b) shows the high temperature dielectric permittivity of PT-BS with x = 0.3725 and PT-BNH with x = 0.39 respectively. In relaxor ferroelectric PT-BNH dielectric permittivity continuously decreases with increasing the frequency. All these features indicate the relaxor nature of PT-BNH. Relaxors are characterized by the presence of local structural heterogeneities and their domains are in form of polar nano regions (PNRs). At very high temperature well above the TC, the PNR transform to the high symmetry cubic phase rendering the material paraelectric. On contrary PT-BS with x = 0.3725 shows conventional ferroelectric behavior where TC remains unchanged with frequency. The ferroelectric-paraelectric transition peak is sharper in comparison to PT-BNH x = 0.39 which has a diffused peak. Prior studies have reported similar characteristics for the (MPB) PT-BS with x = 0.3725 composition. We carried out high temperature XRD measurement on poled composition of PT-BNH with x = 0.39. For this, pellet was poled at 40 kV/cm on room temperature and crushed into fine powder. (a) - (d) displays the evolution of the pseudocubic {200}pc Bragg profile of poled (1-x)PT-(x)BNH (x = 0.39) with temperature, variation of lattice parameter, unit cell volume, and tetragonality (c/a) of poled (1-x)PT-(x)BNH (x = 0.39) with temperature, respectively. shows room temperature Raman spectra of representative compositions of (1-x)PT-(x)BS and (1-x)PT-(x)BNH specimens in their unpoled and poled states. Lorentzian fitting was carried out to the Raman data of the specimens after correcting the Bose-Einstein factor. (a) and (e) show the Lorentzian curve fitting of unpoled MPB PT-BS composition (x = 0.3725) and pseudo-MPB PT-BNH composition (x = 0.39), respectively. Following earlier literatures , the Raman spectra were fitted with nine different peaks (modes) \u2013 (1) E(TO1)\u223c65 cmE^{\u22121}, (2) E(LO1) \u223c76 cmE^{\u22121}, (3) A1(1TO) \u223c191 cmE^{\u22121}, (4) E(2TO) \u223c 272.2 cmE^{\u22121}, (5) (B1 + E) \u223c 330 cmE^{\u22121}, (6) A1(2TO) \u223c 387.6 cmE^{\u22121}, (7) E(3TO) \u223c 497.8 cmE^{\u22121}, (8) TO3(A1 +E) \u223c556 cmE^{\u22121}, and (9) A1(3TO) \u223c607 cmE^{\u22121} respectively. Peaks 1 and 2 (E (TO1) mode) arise due to the A-O vibrational mode (for perovskite with general formula ABO3). Peak 3 corresponds to the A-B site coupling, and peaks 4\u20136 are associated B-O vibrational mode. Peaks 7\u20139 arise from the oxygen translatory motion associated with the oxygen octahedral. For example, the A1(1TO) mode has been recorded at \u223c180 cmE^{\u22121} for 0.59PbTiO3-0.41Bi(Ni1/2Zr1/2)O3 , \u223c185 cmE^{\u22121} for 0.4PbTiO3-0.6BiFeO3 and at \u223c172 cmE^{\u22121} in 0.65PbTiO3-0.35 Bi(Zn1/2Ti1/2)O3 , and \u223c185 cmE^{\u22121} in 0.66PbTiO3-0.34 BiScO3. In the A-BO3 translational mode vibration, the A1(1TO) mode is related with off-center polar displacement of A-site cations (BiE^{3+/}PbE^{2+}) with respect to BO6 octahedra. Noticeable softening (\u0394\u03c9 = 10 cmE^{\u22121}) in the (B1 + E) mode (peak 5) is observed after poling in x = 0.3725 of PT-BS, (c). Mode softening in the Raman spectra indicates field induced local structural transformation in the MPB PT-BS composition which complies with the field induced structural transformation at a global length scale as per XRPD. No obvious mode softening is observed upon poling in x = 0.36 and x = 0.40 of PT-BS, (b) and 7 (d). Similarity in the profile of Raman spectra of PT-BNH compositions ((f) \u22127 (h)) in the unpoled state suggests invariant local structural symmetry across the compositions. Therefore, what globally appears as cubic like structure (XRPD pattern), is essentially has tetragonal symmetry with smaller co-relation length. In pure tetragonal PbTiO3 the A site is being occupied with Pb and B site with Ti as we \u0111ope BNH in the system, Bismuth competes with Pb on A sites and NH with Ti on B site. Though we see no additional Raman signature confirming no change in tetragonal structure but broadening of the Raman peaks can be seen as we increase the concentration of BNH in the system. This is expected as multiple ions on A and B sites compete and with vibrational frequency\u2019s very near to each other thus contributing to very close Raman peaks which is reflected as broadening. depicts the compares of the room-temperature PDFs of the poled and unpoled specimens of PT-BS with x = 0.3725 and PT-BNH with x = 0.39 samples extracted from the x-ray scattering data for the range of inter atomic distances (r). Therefore, we have observed in PT-BS and in PT-BNH alloys unpoled, the pair correlations from3.0 to 4.5 \xc5 [see (c, d)] mainly refer to the nearest-neighbor A/B-A/B correlations. The others peaks are assigned as \u223c3.38 \xc5 correspond to nearest-neighbor A-B pairs, while that at \u223c3.94 \xc5 by nearest-neighbor A-A and B-B pairs. However, a general observation is that the local structural features in unpoled and poled of PT-BS with x = 0.3725 [(c, e)] remain, at least visibly, very similar in terms of nearest-neighbor distances, while local structural observation of unpoled and poled of PT-BNH with x = 0.39 in (d, f) some visible changes in nearest neighbor distances. Therefore, we have extracted some first-hand quantitative information, the peaks from 3.0 to 4.5 \xc5 were fitted with two Gaussians (minimum number of peaks required to follow the feature) as shown in (d) for PT-BNH with x = 0.39. Compare unpoled (c) and poled (e) of PT-BS with x = 03725, which shows no significant change in FWHM and bond distances due in both samples shows coexistence of monoclinic and tetragonal phases, which is clearly seen in x-ray pattern [ left panel unpoled state and (a) poled state]. It is clear that from (d, e) clearly indicate that the changes in the peaks at \u223c3.5 \xc5, which arise from the nearest Pb/Bi-(Ni, Hf, Ti) pairs, exhibit obvious changes after poling. According to the definition of PDF, this behavior implies a significant bond length change between B-site atoms and their adjacent Pb/Bi atoms. Another observation is that the peak at \u223c4.02 \xc5 shows almost no shift after poling. The peak at \u223c4.02 \xc5 corresponds to the A-A/B-B atom pair\u2019s parallel to < 100 > direction, which is the polar axis of the tetragonal. In (d) unpoled and 8 (e) poled of PT-BNH with x = 0.39, the widening of the distribution of displacements for the A-site cations in unpoled state as compare to poled state have significant and steady decrease in the FWHM of first peak.

Solid solutions of the two ferroelectric ceramic system (1-x)PbTiO3- (x)Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 [PT-BNH] and (1-x)PbTiO3-(x)BiScO3 [PT-BS] were prepared using solid-state synthesis technique. Ultra high-purity analytical-reagents (AR) grade Bi2O3 (99 %, Alfa-Aesar), PbO (99.9 % Alfa-Aesar), NiO (99 %, Alfa-Aesar), HfO2 (99.9 % Alfa-Aesar), Sc2O3 (99.99 % Alfa-Aesar) and TiO2 (99.8 %, Alfa-Aesar) chemicals were mixed homogenously for 12 hours duration as per stoichiometric ratios using a planetary ball mill with zirconia jar and zirconia balls in presence of acetone as milling agents (Fritsch P5). The homogenous mixed powder was calcined at temperature of around 900 \xb0C for 5 hours. Then the pure phase calcined powder was mixed with an organic binder made from a 3 wt% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution in deionized water and pressed in the form of pellets of 12 mm and 14 mm diameter using uniaxial pressure die at 100 MPa. Then these green pellets were sintered at an elevated temperature of 1190 \xb0C for 2 hours inside a muffle furnace by sealing it inside a alumina crucible using MgO and using pre calcined as a spacer powder. The sintered pellet was crushed and annealed at 600 \xb0C for 4 hours to remove any effect of mechanical strains acquired during the crushing process and then analyzed using X-ray diffraction. This analysis was performed on Rigaku (SMART LAB) diffractometer equipped with a Johansson-monochromator to exclude Cu-K2 radiation from the input x-ray beam; structural characterization was carried out utilizing X-ray diffraction (XRD) for powder in Bragg-Brentano reflection geometry. Structure refinement was performed using FULLPROF software. A scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL) was used to examine the microstructure. Dense sintered pellets were covered with silver paste to create electrodes and baked at 250 \xb0C for 45 minutes for poling to investigate the electric field induced phase transition. Silver coated/polished ceramic pellets were polarized in silicone oil bath at room temperature for 1 hour by applying a DC electric field of 40 kV / cm. For understanding the effect of electric field poling on structural phase, poled pellets were grounded gently into fine powder and XRD data was collected to examine for phase transformation, if any. Using the piezo test PM-300, the longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient (d33) was determined after poling the pellets at room temperature for 1 hour at a DC-electric field of 40.0 kV/cm. Novocontrol (Alpha-A USA) impedance analyzer was used for dielectric dispersion and permittivity measurement. Using the 532 nm line of an Ar + ion laser as the excitation source line, Raman spectra of the unpolled composition at room temperature were recorded from 50 cmE^{\u22121} to 1000 cmE^{\u22121}on a LabRam HR multi-channel spectrometer fitted with a microscope. Raman data was collected under an x50 microscope in a micro-Raman backscatter configuration with a laser spot size of 1 \u03bcmE^{2}. The pair distribution function was derived using the PDFgetX3 software using total X-ray scattering data acquired at DESY's PETRA III powder diffraction synchrotron beam line P02.1 with an incoming beam intensity of 60 keV.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The gradual evolution of the pseudocubic {111}pc, {200}pc and {220}pc Bragg peaks profiles of (1-x)PbTiO3-(x)BiScO3 (0.36\u2264x \u22640.40) with composition (x) is shown in (a). The Bragg intensity of the rhombohedral / monoclinic phase is pronounced at x = 0.365. At x = 0.365, the rhombohedral / monoclinic phase's Bragg intensity is very strong, with increase in BiScO3 concentration (x), the height or intensity of the monoclinic peak steadily grows. For composition with x = 0.39, the monoclinic peaks dominate the pattern and the tetragonal peaks in the tail or background region are barely visible. Complete pattern fitting of XRD data was performed using the Rietveld method using a tetragonal (P4mm) + monoclinic (Cm) average structure. It should be observed that the compositions x = 0.40 and x = 0.36 appear to be pure rhombohedral / monoclinic and tetragonal phases, respectively, but the structural model fit was enhanced when the second sub phase or minor phase was included. Similarly, we have present Bragg peak profile of (1-x)PbTiO3-(x)Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 (0.35\u2264x\u22640.42) with composition (x) respectively in (b). The {111}pc profile remains singlet in all compositions and indicates the CL phase. Based on this visual examination of the Bragg profile, the overall pattern fit of the XRD data was performed using the Rietveld method with a tetragonal (P4mm) + cubic (Pm3\u0305m) average structure. It should be emphasized that the cubic (Pm3\u0305m) structure used here is for convenience only and does not represent the true structure, as will be disclosed in the following section. These two structural phase coexistence models of (P4mm) + cubic (Pm3\u0305m) fits the data very well. It can note that although the components x = 0.40, 0.42 and x = 0.35 appeared as pure and quaternary CL, respectively, the fit improved as the phase the second smallest is included in the structural model. (a) and 2 (d) shows the composition dependence lattice parameters of PT-BS and PT-BNH systems. As it can be seen clearly in (a), Lattice parameters \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 increases while \u2018c\u2019 decreases for monoclinic with increase in x (composition), similarly with increasing x, the tetragonal 'a' parameter grows, whereas the 'c' parameter decreases. While in (d) tetragonal \u2018a\u2019 parameter increases, and the \u2018c\u2019 parameter decreases with increasing x. This becomes more apparent with tetragonal (c / a) compositional changes ((b) and 2 (e)). SEM micrograph of PT-BS with x = 0.3725 and PT-BNH with x = 0.39 are shown in (a) and 3 (b) respectively. The average grain size was found to approximately (4\u20135 \xb5m) for these sample. Short correlation length is the indication of presence of nano polar region which is well known in the case of relaxor ferroelectric similar to PT-BNH system to show high piezoelectric property. Thus an optimum coherent length results in like high piezoelectricity. (c, f) depicts that variation of longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) of PT-BS and PT-BNH with composition. It is evident from (c, f) that d 33 drastically enhanced in the intermediate composition range decreasing on each side of the MPB, demarcating the MPB area. In the unpoled state of the PT-BNH for the x = 0.39 (large piezoelectric response) tetragonal and cubic similar phases coexist, similar to ordinary MPB systems of PT-BS, where the phase coexistence of tetragonal and rhombohedral/monoclinic regions, there is a strong piezoelectric response. Except for PT-BNZ and PT-BS , this d 33 value is comparable or higher than that of several other reported Bi/Pb-based MPB solid solutions such as 0.63Bi(Mg1/2Ti1/2)O3-0.37PbTiO3 , 0.51Bi(Ni1/2Ti1/2)O3-0.49PbTiO3 , 0.38Bi(Mg3/4W1/4)O3-0.62PbTiO3 , 0.35Bi(Ni2/3Nb1/3)O3-0.65PbTiO3. (a, c) shows the electric field driven phase transformations in PT-BS and PT-BNH. To study the effect of electric field in PT-BS and PT-BNH, pellets of various compositions of PT-BS and PT-BNH were poled at 40 kV/cm on silicon oil bath at room temperature. The poled pellets were crushed into fine powders and XRD pattern was recorded. We have observed from (a) {002}pc/{200}pc XRD profiles which appear to be triplet for the composition with x = 0.3725 in the unpoled state [ (left panel)] unpoled state does not fully transform into tetragonal phase with fraction of rhombohedral phase still persisting after applied electric field. Similarly, the {111}pc XRD peak remains doublet reveals the rhombohedral/monoclinic phase. For the MPB compositions with x = 0.365 \u2013 0.39, similar trend obtained for unpoled and poled samples. As can be seen from (c) that {002}pc/{200}pc XRD profiles which appear to be singlet for the composition with x = 0.40 in the unpoled state [ (right panel)] splitted into two peaks after applied electric field. The {111}pc XRD peak is remain singlet reveals the tetragonal structure for x = 0.40. For the MPB compositions with x = 0.36 \u2013 0.39, similar trend obtained for poled samples. Pseudocubic reflections {200}pc which have triplet nature (for x = 0.36\u20130.39) in unpoled state [ (right panel)] transform in tetragonal phase with doublet {002}pc/{200}pc reflections. (b) and 4 (d) shows the variation of tetragonality (c/a) of poled samples on application of electric field. The tetragonality of poled samples is higher than that of annealed samples of PT-BNH, while no significant changes in tetragonality is observed after poling in conventional PT-BS (MPB) systems. (a) and (b) shows the high temperature dielectric permittivity of PT-BS with x = 0.3725 and PT-BNH with x = 0.39 respectively. In relaxor ferroelectric PT-BNH dielectric permittivity continuously decreases with increasing the frequency. All these features indicate the relaxor nature of PT-BNH. Relaxors are characterized by the presence of local structural heterogeneities and their domains are in form of polar nano regions (PNRs). At very high temperature well above the TC, the PNR transform to the high symmetry cubic phase rendering the material paraelectric. On contrary PT-BS with x = 0.3725 shows conventional ferroelectric behavior where TC remains unchanged with frequency. The ferroelectric-paraelectric transition peak is sharper in comparison to PT-BNH x = 0.39 which has a diffused peak. Prior studies have reported similar characteristics for the (MPB) PT-BS with x = 0.3725 composition. We carried out high temperature XRD measurement on poled composition of PT-BNH with x = 0.39. For this, pellet was poled at 40 kV/cm on room temperature and crushed into fine powder. (a) - (d) displays the evolution of the pseudocubic {200}pc Bragg profile of poled (1-x)PT-(x)BNH (x = 0.39) with temperature, variation of lattice parameter, unit cell volume, and tetragonality (c/a) of poled (1-x)PT-(x)BNH (x = 0.39) with temperature, respectively. shows room temperature Raman spectra of representative compositions of (1-x)PT-(x)BS and (1-x)PT-(x)BNH specimens in their unpoled and poled states. Lorentzian fitting was carried out to the Raman data of the specimens after correcting the Bose-Einstein factor. (a) and (e) show the Lorentzian curve fitting of unpoled MPB PT-BS composition (x = 0.3725) and pseudo-MPB PT-BNH composition (x = 0.39), respectively. Following earlier literatures , the Raman spectra were fitted with nine different peaks (modes) \u2013 (1) E(TO1)\u223c65 cmE^{\u22121}, (2) E(LO1) \u223c76 cmE^{\u22121}, (3) A1(1TO) \u223c191 cmE^{\u22121}, (4) E(2TO) \u223c 272.2 cmE^{\u22121}, (5) (B1 + E) \u223c 330 cmE^{\u22121}, (6) A1(2TO) \u223c 387.6 cmE^{\u22121}, (7) E(3TO) \u223c 497.8 cmE^{\u22121}, (8) TO3(A1 +E) \u223c556 cmE^{\u22121}, and (9) A1(3TO) \u223c607 cmE^{\u22121} respectively. Peaks 1 and 2 (E (TO1) mode) arise due to the A-O vibrational mode (for perovskite with general formula ABO3). Peak 3 corresponds to the A-B site coupling, and peaks 4\u20136 are associated B-O vibrational mode. Peaks 7\u20139 arise from the oxygen translatory motion associated with the oxygen octahedral. For example, the A1(1TO) mode has been recorded at \u223c180 cmE^{\u22121} for 0.59PbTiO3-0.41Bi(Ni1/2Zr1/2)O3 , \u223c185 cmE^{\u22121} for 0.4PbTiO3-0.6BiFeO3 and at \u223c172 cmE^{\u22121} in 0.65PbTiO3-0.35 Bi(Zn1/2Ti1/2)O3 , and \u223c185 cmE^{\u22121} in 0.66PbTiO3-0.34 BiScO3. In the A-BO3 translational mode vibration, the A1(1TO) mode is related with off-center polar displacement of A-site cations (BiE^{3+/}PbE^{2+}) with respect to BO6 octahedra. Noticeable softening (\u0394\u03c9 = 10 cmE^{\u22121}) in the (B1 + E) mode (peak 5) is observed after poling in x = 0.3725 of PT-BS, (c). Mode softening in the Raman spectra indicates field induced local structural transformation in the MPB PT-BS composition which complies with the field induced structural transformation at a global length scale as per XRPD. No obvious mode softening is observed upon poling in x = 0.36 and x = 0.40 of PT-BS, (b) and 7 (d). Similarity in the profile of Raman spectra of PT-BNH compositions ((f) \u22127 (h)) in the unpoled state suggests invariant local structural symmetry across the compositions. Therefore, what globally appears as cubic like structure (XRPD pattern), is essentially has tetragonal symmetry with smaller co-relation length. In pure tetragonal PbTiO3 the A site is being occupied with Pb and B site with Ti as we \u0111ope BNH in the system, Bismuth competes with Pb on A sites and NH with Ti on B site. Though we see no additional Raman signature confirming no change in tetragonal structure but broadening of the Raman peaks can be seen as we increase the concentration of BNH in the system. This is expected as multiple ions on A and B sites compete and with vibrational frequency\u2019s very near to each other thus contributing to very close Raman peaks which is reflected as broadening. depicts the compares of the room-temperature PDFs of the poled and unpoled specimens of PT-BS with x = 0.3725 and PT-BNH with x = 0.39 samples extracted from the x-ray scattering data for the range of inter atomic distances (r). Therefore, we have observed in PT-BS and in PT-BNH alloys unpoled, the pair correlations from3.0 to 4.5 \xc5 [see (c, d)] mainly refer to the nearest-neighbor A/B-A/B correlations. The others peaks are assigned as \u223c3.38 \xc5 correspond to nearest-neighbor A-B pairs, while that at \u223c3.94 \xc5 by nearest-neighbor A-A and B-B pairs. However, a general observation is that the local structural features in unpoled and poled of PT-BS with x = 0.3725 [(c, e)] remain, at least visibly, very similar in terms of nearest-neighbor distances, while local structural observation of unpoled and poled of PT-BNH with x = 0.39 in (d, f) some visible changes in nearest neighbor distances. Therefore, we have extracted some first-hand quantitative information, the peaks from 3.0 to 4.5 \xc5 were fitted with two Gaussians (minimum number of peaks required to follow the feature) as shown in (d) for PT-BNH with x = 0.39. Compare unpoled (c) and poled (e) of PT-BS with x = 03725, which shows no significant change in FWHM and bond distances due in both samples shows coexistence of monoclinic and tetragonal phases, which is clearly seen in x-ray pattern [ left panel unpoled state and (a) poled state]. It is clear that from (d, e) clearly indicate that the changes in the peaks at \u223c3.5 \xc5, which arise from the nearest Pb/Bi-(Ni, Hf, Ti) pairs, exhibit obvious changes after poling. According to the definition of PDF, this behavior implies a significant bond length change between B-site atoms and their adjacent Pb/Bi atoms. Another observation is that the peak at \u223c4.02 \xc5 shows almost no shift after poling. The peak at \u223c4.02 \xc5 corresponds to the A-A/B-B atom pair\u2019s parallel to < 100 > direction, which is the polar axis of the tetragonal. In (d) unpoled and 8 (e) poled of PT-BNH with x = 0.39, the widening of the distribution of displacements for the A-site cations in unpoled state as compare to poled state have significant and steady decrease in the FWHM of first peak.
