0.5Pb(Ni1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.16PbZrO3-0.34PbTiO3 matrix powders were synthesized by conventional solid-state reaction with the raw materials PbO (99.99%, Kojundo Chemical Laboratory, Japan), NiO (99.9%, Kojundo Chemical Laboratory, Japan), Nb2O5 (99.9%, Kojundo Chemical Laboratory, Japan), ZrO2 (99.9%, Kojundo Chemical Laboratory, Japan), and TiO2 (99.9%, Kojundo Chemical Laboratory, Japan). The mixture of raw materials was ball-milled using zirconia balls (\u03a6 = 1 mm, 3 mm, 5 mm, and 10 mm) for 24 h and dried at 90\xb0C. Then, the milled PNN-PZT powders were calcined at 850\xb0C for 4 h (heating rate: 5\xb0C/min). After calcination, 0.2 wt% of Li2CO3 (99%, Kojundo Chemical Laboratory, Japan) was added to the calcined 0.5Pb(Ni1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.16PbZrO3-0.34PbTiO3 powder as a sintering aid. The mixture was subsequently ball-milled for 48 h with zirconia balls (\u03a6 = 1 mm, 3 mm, 5 mm, and 10 mm) and dried at 90\xb0C. Ethyl alcohol (99.9%, Daejung Chemical, Korea), toluene (99.9%, Daejung Chemical, Korea), dibutyl phthalate (99%, Daejung Chemical, Korea), polyvinyl butyral (BM-SZ, Sekisui, Japan), and dispersant (BYK-111, BYK-Chemie GmbH, Germany) were mixed with PNNZT powders at an optimized ratio and ball-milled for 24 h with zirconia balls (\u03a6 = 3 mm, 5 mm, 10 mm, and 15 mm). After ball milling, the PNNZT slurry was separated from the zirconia balls using a mesh fabric, and any remaining air bubbles were removed using a vacuum chamber for 15 min. An aging process followed for 2 h at 15 rpm to stabilize the slurry. BT-template-free thick sheets were prepared via tape casting at a casting speed of 1 m/min with a blade gap of 85 \u03bcm. The resulting PNNZT sheets had a thickness of 17 \u03bcm. Ethyl alcohol (99.9%, Daejung Chemical, Korea), toluene (99.9%, Daejung Chemical, Korea), dibutyl phthalate (99%, Daejung Chemical, Korea), polyvinyl butyral (BM-SZ, Sekisui, Japan), and dispersant (BYK-111, BYK-Chemie GmbH, Germany) were mixed with PNNZT powders at an optimized ratio and ball-milled for 24 h with zirconia balls (\u03a6 = 3 mm, 5 mm, 10 mm, and 15 mm). After ball milling, the PNNZT slurry was separated from the zirconia balls using a mesh fabric. BT templates (Entekno Materials, Turkey) were dispersed in a small amount of ethanol using a sonicator for 5 min and then added to the separated PNNZT slurry. More details of BT templates were shown in. Any remaining air bubbles in the slurry were removed using a vacuum chamber for 15 min. The slurry was then aged for 2 h at 15 rpm to stabilize it. BT-included thin sheets were prepared via tape casting at a casting speed of 1 m/min with a blade gap of 8 \u03bcm. The resulting PNNZT-BT sheets had a thickness of 5 \u03bcm. The obtained PNNZT and PNNZT-BT sheets were alternately laminated, one by one, using a lamination machine under 10 MPa of pressure and at a temperature of 60\xb0C. The laminated sheets were then subjected to a warm isostatic pressing (WIP) process to achieve denser laminates, by applying 25 MPa of pressure at 65\xb0C for 20 min. After the WIP process, the PNNZT/PNNZT-BT laminates were cut into 10 mm \xd7 10 mm pieces using a blade cutter. To burn out the organic components in the PNNZT/PNNZT-BT laminates, the cut pieces were fired at 300\xb0C and 600\xb0C for 5 h at each temperature, with a heating rate of 1\xb0C/min. Thereafter, the fired PNNZT/PNNZT-BT laminates were pressed using a cold isostatic press (CIP) machine for 1 min under 200 MPa at room temperature to compensate for the volumetric loss of organic components. The CIP-treated specimens were then sintered at various temperatures ranging from 900\xb0C to 1025\xb0C, in 25\xb0C intervals, for 15 h under an O2 atmosphere. During sintering, the flow rate and heating rate were maintained at 1 L/min and 1\xb0C/min, respectively. After sintering, Ag paste was applied to both sides of the sintered body and fired at 700\xb0C for 10 min. Finally, poling was conducted at 3.5 kV/mm for 20 min at room temperature in silicone oil. The crystal structure was analyzed using an X-ray diffractometer (D8 Advance 25, Bruker, USA) over a 2\u03b8 range of 20\xb0\u201360\xb0, with Cu K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 1.5406 \xc5), operating at 40 kV and 40 mA for 10 min. The piezoelectric charge constant (d 33) was measured using a d 33 meter (ZJ-6B, IACAS, China). The dielectric constant (\u03b5 E^{T} 33/\u03b5 0) and piezoelectric properties (k p, g 33, Q m) were calculated using an impedance analyzer (E4990A, Keysight, USA) based on the measured values of resonance frequency (f r), anti-resonance frequency (f a), impedance at f r (R), and capacitance (C p). The microstructures were observed using FESEM (MIRA3 LM, TESCAN, Czech) with 15 kV of accelerating voltage. The polarization versus electric field (P-E) hysteresis curves were measured under a period of 1000 ms using a ferroelectric tester (Radiant Technology, USA). Unipolar strain-electric field (S-E) curves were measured at 1 Hz using a piezoelectric evaluation system (aixPES-TF analyzer 2000: aixACCT Systems GmbH, Aachen, Germany). Temperature-dependent dielectric characteristics were measured using an impedance/gain phase analyzer (4194A, Hewlett-Packard, USA) over a temperature range from 20 to 200\xb0C. The measurements were carried out with the assistance of temperature control equipment (Model THTC1000, Thermotech, South Korea).

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
shows comparative schematic illustrations of conventional 3DD TGG and the proposed 2DD TGG processes for fabricating BT-templated PNNZT texture ceramics. A representative material image or cross-sectional image characterizing a meaningful aspect of the individual TGG process is included for each process step in. The left column in shows the 3DD TGG that can occur in a conventional TGG process when used to fabricate textured piezoelectric ceramics. In this work, the mixed slurry for the 3DD TGG process was prepared using the calcined PNNZT powders and the plate-like BT templates, along with several organic materials introduced in the experimental part. Then thick PNNZT green sheets containing the 3DD BT templates were produced by a conventional tape casting method. To fabricate the BT-templated PNNZT ceramic, the PNNZT green sheets with 3DD BT templates are stacked under high pressure to form a homogeneous piezoelectric ceramic laminate, and then they are sintered to make PNNZT texture ceramic. In contrast to the typical TGG process, the proposed TGG process in this work has different slurry, tape casting, and stacking process steps, as can be seen in the right column of. One is the BT template-free slurry with PNNZT and organic materials. The other is the BT template-included slurry with PNNZT and organic materials, which is almost identical to the typical TGG process except for its viscosity. Here, importantly, both the template-free and template-included slurries must be thoroughly controlled to make green sheets thinner than those produced by the typical 3DD TGG process. More importantly, the thickness of the PNNZT green sheet containing the BT templates should be extremely thin to properly arrange the two-dimensionally aligned BT platelets. Lastly, in the step of stacking, the heterogeneous BT-free and BT-included PNNZT green sheets are laminated alternately. As a result, the microstructure of the PNNZT textured ceramics developed after sintering can have clearly different grain morphologies, as shown in the cross-sectional images in the last column of. It's likely that the PNNZT grains epitaxially-grown from the misaligned BT templates with the 3DD TGG process might degrade the degree of texture in the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramic. Meanwhile, the equi-aligned BT templates produced by the proposed 2DD TGG process can result in a PNNZT ceramic with higher degrees of texture. In addition, by prohibiting collisions between neighboring growing PNNZT epitaxial grains, the BT-free PNNZT layers can support the independent growth of epitaxial PNNZT grains on the BT platelets with equi-axial alignment. To investigate the effects of 2DD TGG, XRD and FESEM structural analyses were carried out as follows. (a) shows XRD patterns of the textured PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics prepared with the 2DD TGG process as a function of sintering temperature from 900\xb0C to 1025\xb0C for 15 h with an interval of 25\xb0C. It was found that all of the PNNZT ceramics were successfully textured with a perovskite crystal symmetry without any secondary phase. The incredibly enhanced (001) and (002) peaks belonging to the {001} plane group and the deteriorated (101) plane provided obvious evidence that the PNNZT ceramics were strongly textured on the BT platelets, with a [001] orientation. The gradual enforcement of the {001} planes with increasing sintering temperature up to 1000 \xb0C, implies that the growth of the PNNZT grains along the [001] direction depend heavily on the increasing sintering temperature. However, when it exceeded 1000\xb0C, the peak intensities of the (001) and (002) planes were slightly degraded. In contrast, the variation in the intensity of the (101) peak near 32\xb0 showed a tendency opposite to that of the {001} plane group with increasing sintering temperature. These results indicate that the PNNZT ceramics are most strongly textured via the 2DD TGG process when the sintering temperature reaches 1000\xb0C. This is shown by the Lotgering factor (f L)  in (a), which can be expressed with the following Equations , where I(00l) and I 0 (00l) are the intensity of the (00l) reflection, I(hkl) and I 0 (hkl) are the intensity of the (hkl) reflection, and P and P 0 represent the textured and randomly oriented materials. The texture degree obtained from the PNNZT ceramic sintered at 1000\xb0C had the highest value of 94%. To examine the effect of the 2DD TGG process enhancement on the texture degree of the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics, the f L values of the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics prepared by the conventional 3DD and the proposed 2DD TGG processes were compared as a function of sintering temperature from 900\xb0C to 1025\xb0C. More details, including f L for the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics prepared with the conventional TGG process can be obtained in our previous report. All of the f L values obtained from the 2DD TGG case were higher than those of the 3DD TGG, as seen in (b). However, while the f L value of the PNNZT ceramic textured via the 2DD TGG process steadily increased, it slightly decreased when the sintering temperature exceeded 1000\xb0C, and the gap in f L for the different TGG processes was further enlarged. These results imply that the proposed TGG process using 2DD BT platelets in this work was much more effective at improving the texture of the PNNZT ceramics than the conventional 3DD TGG process. Cross-sectional FESEM images of the textured PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics sintered at 900\xb0C, 950\xb0C, and 1000\xb0C, prepared using the proposed 2DD and conventional 3DD TGG processes, respectively, are comparatively shown in (a)\u2013(c). It seems that all of the ceramics were highly densified and successfully textured by sintering at the given temperature condition, since many epitaxial grains grew on the seed crystals of the BT platelets in most regions in each PNNZT ceramic. It was also obvious that the epitaxially-grown PNNZT grains became significantly larger with increasing sintering temperature from 900\xb0C to 950\xb0C [see (a) and (b)]. When the sintering temperature was further increased to 1000\xb0C, the cross-sections of both specimens were nearly covered by the texture grains, as shown in (c). While this morphological structure evolved with the increase in sintering temperature, the growth of the PNNZT matrix grains was insignificant. This phenomenon confirms that the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramic can be well textured even at the sintering temperatures below 1025\xb0C. However, notably, the morphological evolution was clearly differentiated in the microstructures of both specimens as they evolved via the proposed 2DD and conventional 3DD TGG processes. Under the proposed 2DD TGG process, the highly equi-aligned BT templates allowed the small PNNZT matrix grains to move around the BT and thereafter, to grow epitaxially on it without any interruption from neighboring misaligned BT-templated grains [see the right column images in ]. However, it is clear that the developed epitaxial PNNZT grains were distributed in a relatively random arrangement under the conventional 3DD TGG process. Moreover, some of the PNNZT epitaxial grains growing on the misaligned BT platelets seem to hinder the other epitaxial grains growing on neighbors, as marked by the yellow dotted boxes in the left column images in. As a consequence, to achieve highly textured piezoelectric ceramics, the 2DD TGG process proposed in this work is recommended. To address the temperature-dependent growth behavior of the BT-templated PNNZT epitaxial grains, the characteristic grain size was deeply analyzed, based on the epitaxially-grown grains and the untextured matrix grains in the cross-sectional FESEM image at each sintering temperature. The grain size distribution in the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics, textured by the conventional 3DD TGG and proposed 2DD TGG processes, was examined for various sintering temperatures of 900\xb0C, 950\xb0C, and 1000\xb0C, as shown in (a). 120 epitaxial grains for each of the different sintering temperatures were analyzed to plot the distribution data. The grain size of an epitaxial PNNZT grain was measured along the vertical and lateral directions, excluding the dimensions of the BT template, as shown in the inset image of (a). The resultant average grain size of the PNNZT epitaxial grains is also shown in (b), along with average grain size of the PNNZT grains in the untextured region, which was measured using the line intercept method. It was found that the epitaxial grain growth in the vertical direction was preferred to that of the lateral direction under all conditions such as sintering temperature, and for the 2DD or 3DD TGG processes. As already confirmed in , the average grain size showed a steadily increasing tendency with increasing sintering temperature, regardless of the TGG process used. The difference in average grain size for both the 2DD and 3DD TGG processes at 900\xb0C was insignificant, but it dramatically increased when the sintering temperature was 950\xb0C. However, the grain-size gap declined when the sintering temperature further increased to 1000\xb0C. This result is attributed to the relatively limited thickness (\u223c17 \u03bcm) of the BT-template-free layers of the PNNZT ceramic textured by the 2DD TGG process. As shown in (b), most of the PNNZT epitaxial grains did not entirely grow during sintering at 950\xb0C. However, it was clearly detected that there were no untextured grains in the vicinity of the boundaries between a couple of epitaxial grains located along the vertical axis when the sintering temperature was 1000\xb0C. This means that the PNNZT grains in the BT-free layers were excessively textured along the upward and downward direction of the surface of each BT template. In other words, the two PNNZT grains epitaxially-growing while facing each other collided, and they couldn't grow anymore in the vertical direction. Therefore, since the template-free sheets were thicker than 17 \u03bcm, there is no doubt that the average size of the epitaxial PNNZT grains would be much greater under the sintering condition of 1000\xb0C. shows the dielectric constant (\u03b5 E^{T} 33/\u03b5 0) and piezoelectric properties of the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics textured by the 2DD TGG process, sintered at various temperatures from 900\xb0C to 1025\xb0C for 15 h. The \u03b5 E^{T} 33/\u03b5 0 values decreased steadily with increasing temperature to 1000\xb0C. However, it slightly improved when the sintering temperature reached 1025\xb0C. The piezoelectric properties of piezoelectric charge constant (d 33), electromechanical coupling factor (k p), and piezoelectric voltage constant (g 33) commonly showed a tendency opposite to that of the dielectric constant. They were maximized to 1334 pC/N, 92.4 %, and 38.5 \xd7 10E^{\u22123} V\u2219m/N, respectively, when the sintering temperature reached 1000\xb0C. In particular, the d 33 and k p values, comparable to those of well-known piezoelectric single crystals , were incredibly improved due to the strong texture degree developed in the PNNZT ceramic via the 2DD TGG process. Particularly considering that those piezoelectric single crystalline ceramics are achieved at a significantly high sintering temperature, near 1300\xb0C , the d 33 and k p values in the textured PNNZT ceramic sintered at temperatures below 1300\xb0C were much more impressive. All of the \u03b5 E^{T} 33/\u03b5 0 values and piezoelectric properties of the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics textured by the 2DD TGG process are summarized in detail, in. shows the temperature-dependent dielectric constant and dielectric loss for untextured PNNZT ceramics and BT-templated PNNZT ceramics textured using the 3DD and 2DD TGG processes. All samples were sintered at 1000\xb0C for 15 h. The untextured PNNZT ceramic exhibited a temperature at maximum dielectric constant (T m) of 153.8\xb0C at 1 kHz. In comparison, the BT-templated PNNZT ceramics textured via the 3DD and 2DD TGG processes showed slightly lower T m values of 146.4\xb0C and 146.6\xb0C. This reduction in T m is attributed to the low Curie temperature (\u223c120\xb0C) of the BT templates. At room temperature, the dielectric loss values for all samples were low, remaining below 0.05. The T m values of PNNZT ceramics textured using the 2DD and 3DD TGG processes were nearly identical, despite differences in the alignment of BT templates. This result indicates that the alignment of BT templates does not significantly influence the dielectric response of textured PNNZT ceramics. The unipolar strain vs. electric field (S-E) plots of the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics textured using the 2DD TGG process, sintered at various temperatures from 900\xb0C to 1025\xb0C for 15 h, are shown in. The inset shows the large signal piezoelectric coefficient (d 33 E^{\u2217}), where d 33 E^{\u2217} indicating the ratio of maximum S (S max) to maximum E (E max) was obtained at a maximum electric field of 1 kV/mm from the unipolar S-E plot. As the sintering temperature increased from 900\xb0C to 1000\xb0C, d 33 E^{\u2217} exhibited an increasing tendency from 1120 pm/V to 1409 pm/V. Although the d 33 E^{\u2217} value slightly deteriorated to 1291 pm/V when the sintering temperature was further increased to 1025\xb0C, it should be noticed that all the d 33 E^{\u2217} values are incredibly high, considering the significantly low sintering temperature range. The sintering temperature-dependent tendency of d 33 E^{\u2217} is similar to that of piezoelectric d 33, k p, and g 33, as shown in. Probably, it was associated with f L as a function of sintering temperature, in which the texture degree of the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramic has a close relationship with the piezoelectric response affected by polarization rotation. shows the normalized values of \u03b5 E^{T} 33/\u03b5 0, d 33, k p, g 33, and Q m for the untextured PNNZT ceramic and the BT-templated PNNZT ceramics textured by the 3DD and 2DD TGG processes. The dielectric and piezoelectric properties of the untextured and textured PNNZT ceramics fabricated with a conventional process can be obtained from our previous report  since most of the experimental conditions used to fabricate them, including sintering temperature and sintering time, are identical to those of the 2DD TGG process proposed in this work. All of the data compared in were obtained from the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics fabricated under the same sintering conditions at a temperature of 1000\xb0C and holding time of 15 h. It was insignificant for both the parameters of \u03b5 E^{T} 33/\u03b5 0 and Q m because the PNNZT ceramic textured by the 2DD TGG was comparable to those of the other untextured and conventionally textured PNNZT ceramics. However, it should be noted that the piezoelectric d 33, k p, and g 33 values were dramatically improved by as much as approximately 41%, 31%, and 83%, respectively, in comparison with those values of the untextured PNNZT ceramic. In particular, the reduced \u03b5 E^{T} 33/\u03b5 0 was responsible for the extreme increase in g 33 in the PNNZT ceramic fabricated using the 2DD TGG process, based on the relationship of g\u221dd/\u03b5. Furthermore, even when compared with the d 33, k p, and g 33 values of the PNNZT ceramic textured via the conventional 3DD TGG process, those of the PNNZT ceramic textured by the proposed TGG in this work were outstandingly strengthened, as indicated by the blue and green bars for the three parameters in the middle of. Therefore, it is considered that the 2DD TGG process proposed in this work can significantly contribute to a much higher degree of texture in piezoelectric ceramics, when supported by an equi-aligned template material. Polarization vs. electric field (P-E) hysteresis and unipolar strain vs. electric field (S-E) curves were also assessed to validate the effect of the 2DD TGG on the ferroelectric and electrostrain characteristics of the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramic. (a) and (b) exhibit the P-E hysteresis and S-E curves of the untextured PNNZT ceramic and the BT-templated PNNZT ceramics textured by the 3DD and 2DD TGG processes, sintered at 1000\xb0C for 15 h. It was found that all of the PNNZT ceramics exhibited typical ferroelectric characteristics, irrespective of texture degree, as shown in (a). Moreover, the remnant polarization (P r) slightly decreased but the coercive electric field (E c) increased when the BT templates were incorporated into the PNNZT ceramics. The addition of BT with a dielectric constant  much lower than that of PNNZT leads to degradation of the total P r value of the piezoelectric ceramic. However, changing the process from 3DD TGG to 2DD TGG allowed the P r value to increase and the E c value to decrease. The increased P r might be due to the highly improved d 33 value, based on a relationship between P r and d 33 in ferroelectric materials. The associated Eq.  is as follows: where Q 33 and \u03b5 33 are the electrostrictive coefficient and the dielectric permittivity. As already confirmed in , since the dielectric constants for those two cases were similar to each other, the dramatically increased d 33 would mainly contribute to the increase in P r. In case of E c, the enhanced degree of texture along the [001] direction exhibited by the PNNZT ceramic textured by the 2DD TGG process could promote domain movement and lead to the resultant decrease in E c. The inset table in (a) summarizes the 2P r and 2E c values for the given cases. For the electrostriction behavior shown in (b), it was also noticeable that the S max and d 33 E^{\u2217} values for the 2DD TGG case are much superior to those of the untextured and textured by conventional process. Details of the S max and d 33 E^{\u2217} values for all three types are also included in the inset in (b). As already shown in , it was confirmed that the PNNZT ceramic textured via the 2DD TGG process, had the highest strain of 0.138% at 1 kV/mm, corresponding to a d 33 E^{\u2217} value of 1409 pm/V. Despite the large electrostrain characteristic shown in (b), the piezoelectric strain of the piezoelectric actuator must be durable in the working conditions of the application. shows the large-signal d 33 E^{\u2217} value of the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics textured by the 2DD TGG process, sintered at 1000\xb0C for 15 h, as a function of working cycles. The unipolar strain vs. electric field (S-E) curves used for the extraction of the d 33 E^{\u2217} value are inset in. The fatigue testing was performed by applying a bipolar triangular field of 0.9 E c  and at 100 Hz up to 10E^{6} unipolar cycles. Although a monotonous fatigue behavior was present in the textured PNNZT piezoelectric ceramic, the degraded d 33 E^{\u2217} value was as low as 6.5% after 1 M cycles, suggesting that the textured PNNZT ceramic has excellent long lifetime potential for piezoelectric actuator devices.

0.5Pb(Ni1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.16PbZrO3-0.34PbTiO3 matrix powders were synthesized by conventional solid-state reaction with the raw materials PbO (99.99%, Kojundo Chemical Laboratory, Japan), NiO (99.9%, Kojundo Chemical Laboratory, Japan), Nb2O5 (99.9%, Kojundo Chemical Laboratory, Japan), ZrO2 (99.9%, Kojundo Chemical Laboratory, Japan), and TiO2 (99.9%, Kojundo Chemical Laboratory, Japan). The mixture of raw materials was ball-milled using zirconia balls (\u03a6 = 1 mm, 3 mm, 5 mm, and 10 mm) for 24 h and dried at 90\xb0C. Then, the milled PNN-PZT powders were calcined at 850\xb0C for 4 h (heating rate: 5\xb0C/min). After calcination, 0.2 wt% of Li2CO3 (99%, Kojundo Chemical Laboratory, Japan) was added to the calcined 0.5Pb(Ni1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.16PbZrO3-0.34PbTiO3 powder as a sintering aid. The mixture was subsequently ball-milled for 48 h with zirconia balls (\u03a6 = 1 mm, 3 mm, 5 mm, and 10 mm) and dried at 90\xb0C. Ethyl alcohol (99.9%, Daejung Chemical, Korea), toluene (99.9%, Daejung Chemical, Korea), dibutyl phthalate (99%, Daejung Chemical, Korea), polyvinyl butyral (BM-SZ, Sekisui, Japan), and dispersant (BYK-111, BYK-Chemie GmbH, Germany) were mixed with PNNZT powders at an optimized ratio and ball-milled for 24 h with zirconia balls (\u03a6 = 3 mm, 5 mm, 10 mm, and 15 mm). After ball milling, the PNNZT slurry was separated from the zirconia balls using a mesh fabric, and any remaining air bubbles were removed using a vacuum chamber for 15 min. An aging process followed for 2 h at 15 rpm to stabilize the slurry. BT-template-free thick sheets were prepared via tape casting at a casting speed of 1 m/min with a blade gap of 85 \u03bcm. The resulting PNNZT sheets had a thickness of 17 \u03bcm. Ethyl alcohol (99.9%, Daejung Chemical, Korea), toluene (99.9%, Daejung Chemical, Korea), dibutyl phthalate (99%, Daejung Chemical, Korea), polyvinyl butyral (BM-SZ, Sekisui, Japan), and dispersant (BYK-111, BYK-Chemie GmbH, Germany) were mixed with PNNZT powders at an optimized ratio and ball-milled for 24 h with zirconia balls (\u03a6 = 3 mm, 5 mm, 10 mm, and 15 mm). After ball milling, the PNNZT slurry was separated from the zirconia balls using a mesh fabric. BT templates (Entekno Materials, Turkey) were dispersed in a small amount of ethanol using a sonicator for 5 min and then added to the separated PNNZT slurry. More details of BT templates were shown in. Any remaining air bubbles in the slurry were removed using a vacuum chamber for 15 min. The slurry was then aged for 2 h at 15 rpm to stabilize it. BT-included thin sheets were prepared via tape casting at a casting speed of 1 m/min with a blade gap of 8 \u03bcm. The resulting PNNZT-BT sheets had a thickness of 5 \u03bcm. The obtained PNNZT and PNNZT-BT sheets were alternately laminated, one by one, using a lamination machine under 10 MPa of pressure and at a temperature of 60\xb0C. The laminated sheets were then subjected to a warm isostatic pressing (WIP) process to achieve denser laminates, by applying 25 MPa of pressure at 65\xb0C for 20 min. After the WIP process, the PNNZT/PNNZT-BT laminates were cut into 10 mm \xd7 10 mm pieces using a blade cutter. To burn out the organic components in the PNNZT/PNNZT-BT laminates, the cut pieces were fired at 300\xb0C and 600\xb0C for 5 h at each temperature, with a heating rate of 1\xb0C/min. Thereafter, the fired PNNZT/PNNZT-BT laminates were pressed using a cold isostatic press (CIP) machine for 1 min under 200 MPa at room temperature to compensate for the volumetric loss of organic components. The CIP-treated specimens were then sintered at various temperatures ranging from 900\xb0C to 1025\xb0C, in 25\xb0C intervals, for 15 h under an O2 atmosphere. During sintering, the flow rate and heating rate were maintained at 1 L/min and 1\xb0C/min, respectively. After sintering, Ag paste was applied to both sides of the sintered body and fired at 700\xb0C for 10 min. Finally, poling was conducted at 3.5 kV/mm for 20 min at room temperature in silicone oil. The crystal structure was analyzed using an X-ray diffractometer (D8 Advance 25, Bruker, USA) over a 2\u03b8 range of 20\xb0\u201360\xb0, with Cu K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 1.5406 \xc5), operating at 40 kV and 40 mA for 10 min. The piezoelectric charge constant (d 33) was measured using a d 33 meter (ZJ-6B, IACAS, China). The dielectric constant (\u03b5 E^{T} 33/\u03b5 0) and piezoelectric properties (k p, g 33, Q m) were calculated using an impedance analyzer (E4990A, Keysight, USA) based on the measured values of resonance frequency (f r), anti-resonance frequency (f a), impedance at f r (R), and capacitance (C p). The microstructures were observed using FESEM (MIRA3 LM, TESCAN, Czech) with 15 kV of accelerating voltage. The polarization versus electric field (P-E) hysteresis curves were measured under a period of 1000 ms using a ferroelectric tester (Radiant Technology, USA). Unipolar strain-electric field (S-E) curves were measured at 1 Hz using a piezoelectric evaluation system (aixPES-TF analyzer 2000: aixACCT Systems GmbH, Aachen, Germany). Temperature-dependent dielectric characteristics were measured using an impedance/gain phase analyzer (4194A, Hewlett-Packard, USA) over a temperature range from 20 to 200\xb0C. The measurements were carried out with the assistance of temperature control equipment (Model THTC1000, Thermotech, South Korea).

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
shows comparative schematic illustrations of conventional 3DD TGG and the proposed 2DD TGG processes for fabricating BT-templated PNNZT texture ceramics. A representative material image or cross-sectional image characterizing a meaningful aspect of the individual TGG process is included for each process step in. The left column in shows the 3DD TGG that can occur in a conventional TGG process when used to fabricate textured piezoelectric ceramics. In this work, the mixed slurry for the 3DD TGG process was prepared using the calcined PNNZT powders and the plate-like BT templates, along with several organic materials introduced in the experimental part. Then thick PNNZT green sheets containing the 3DD BT templates were produced by a conventional tape casting method. To fabricate the BT-templated PNNZT ceramic, the PNNZT green sheets with 3DD BT templates are stacked under high pressure to form a homogeneous piezoelectric ceramic laminate, and then they are sintered to make PNNZT texture ceramic. In contrast to the typical TGG process, the proposed TGG process in this work has different slurry, tape casting, and stacking process steps, as can be seen in the right column of. One is the BT template-free slurry with PNNZT and organic materials. The other is the BT template-included slurry with PNNZT and organic materials, which is almost identical to the typical TGG process except for its viscosity. Here, importantly, both the template-free and template-included slurries must be thoroughly controlled to make green sheets thinner than those produced by the typical 3DD TGG process. More importantly, the thickness of the PNNZT green sheet containing the BT templates should be extremely thin to properly arrange the two-dimensionally aligned BT platelets. Lastly, in the step of stacking, the heterogeneous BT-free and BT-included PNNZT green sheets are laminated alternately. As a result, the microstructure of the PNNZT textured ceramics developed after sintering can have clearly different grain morphologies, as shown in the cross-sectional images in the last column of. It's likely that the PNNZT grains epitaxially-grown from the misaligned BT templates with the 3DD TGG process might degrade the degree of texture in the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramic. Meanwhile, the equi-aligned BT templates produced by the proposed 2DD TGG process can result in a PNNZT ceramic with higher degrees of texture. In addition, by prohibiting collisions between neighboring growing PNNZT epitaxial grains, the BT-free PNNZT layers can support the independent growth of epitaxial PNNZT grains on the BT platelets with equi-axial alignment. To investigate the effects of 2DD TGG, XRD and FESEM structural analyses were carried out as follows. (a) shows XRD patterns of the textured PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics prepared with the 2DD TGG process as a function of sintering temperature from 900\xb0C to 1025\xb0C for 15 h with an interval of 25\xb0C. It was found that all of the PNNZT ceramics were successfully textured with a perovskite crystal symmetry without any secondary phase. The incredibly enhanced (001) and (002) peaks belonging to the {001} plane group and the deteriorated (101) plane provided obvious evidence that the PNNZT ceramics were strongly textured on the BT platelets, with a [001] orientation. The gradual enforcement of the {001} planes with increasing sintering temperature up to 1000 \xb0C, implies that the growth of the PNNZT grains along the [001] direction depend heavily on the increasing sintering temperature. However, when it exceeded 1000\xb0C, the peak intensities of the (001) and (002) planes were slightly degraded. In contrast, the variation in the intensity of the (101) peak near 32\xb0 showed a tendency opposite to that of the {001} plane group with increasing sintering temperature. These results indicate that the PNNZT ceramics are most strongly textured via the 2DD TGG process when the sintering temperature reaches 1000\xb0C. This is shown by the Lotgering factor (f L)  in (a), which can be expressed with the following Equations , where I(00l) and I 0 (00l) are the intensity of the (00l) reflection, I(hkl) and I 0 (hkl) are the intensity of the (hkl) reflection, and P and P 0 represent the textured and randomly oriented materials. The texture degree obtained from the PNNZT ceramic sintered at 1000\xb0C had the highest value of 94%. To examine the effect of the 2DD TGG process enhancement on the texture degree of the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics, the f L values of the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics prepared by the conventional 3DD and the proposed 2DD TGG processes were compared as a function of sintering temperature from 900\xb0C to 1025\xb0C. More details, including f L for the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics prepared with the conventional TGG process can be obtained in our previous report. All of the f L values obtained from the 2DD TGG case were higher than those of the 3DD TGG, as seen in (b). However, while the f L value of the PNNZT ceramic textured via the 2DD TGG process steadily increased, it slightly decreased when the sintering temperature exceeded 1000\xb0C, and the gap in f L for the different TGG processes was further enlarged. These results imply that the proposed TGG process using 2DD BT platelets in this work was much more effective at improving the texture of the PNNZT ceramics than the conventional 3DD TGG process. Cross-sectional FESEM images of the textured PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics sintered at 900\xb0C, 950\xb0C, and 1000\xb0C, prepared using the proposed 2DD and conventional 3DD TGG processes, respectively, are comparatively shown in (a)\u2013(c). It seems that all of the ceramics were highly densified and successfully textured by sintering at the given temperature condition, since many epitaxial grains grew on the seed crystals of the BT platelets in most regions in each PNNZT ceramic. It was also obvious that the epitaxially-grown PNNZT grains became significantly larger with increasing sintering temperature from 900\xb0C to 950\xb0C [see (a) and (b)]. When the sintering temperature was further increased to 1000\xb0C, the cross-sections of both specimens were nearly covered by the texture grains, as shown in (c). While this morphological structure evolved with the increase in sintering temperature, the growth of the PNNZT matrix grains was insignificant. This phenomenon confirms that the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramic can be well textured even at the sintering temperatures below 1025\xb0C. However, notably, the morphological evolution was clearly differentiated in the microstructures of both specimens as they evolved via the proposed 2DD and conventional 3DD TGG processes. Under the proposed 2DD TGG process, the highly equi-aligned BT templates allowed the small PNNZT matrix grains to move around the BT and thereafter, to grow epitaxially on it without any interruption from neighboring misaligned BT-templated grains [see the right column images in ]. However, it is clear that the developed epitaxial PNNZT grains were distributed in a relatively random arrangement under the conventional 3DD TGG process. Moreover, some of the PNNZT epitaxial grains growing on the misaligned BT platelets seem to hinder the other epitaxial grains growing on neighbors, as marked by the yellow dotted boxes in the left column images in. As a consequence, to achieve highly textured piezoelectric ceramics, the 2DD TGG process proposed in this work is recommended. To address the temperature-dependent growth behavior of the BT-templated PNNZT epitaxial grains, the characteristic grain size was deeply analyzed, based on the epitaxially-grown grains and the untextured matrix grains in the cross-sectional FESEM image at each sintering temperature. The grain size distribution in the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics, textured by the conventional 3DD TGG and proposed 2DD TGG processes, was examined for various sintering temperatures of 900\xb0C, 950\xb0C, and 1000\xb0C, as shown in (a). 120 epitaxial grains for each of the different sintering temperatures were analyzed to plot the distribution data. The grain size of an epitaxial PNNZT grain was measured along the vertical and lateral directions, excluding the dimensions of the BT template, as shown in the inset image of (a). The resultant average grain size of the PNNZT epitaxial grains is also shown in (b), along with average grain size of the PNNZT grains in the untextured region, which was measured using the line intercept method. It was found that the epitaxial grain growth in the vertical direction was preferred to that of the lateral direction under all conditions such as sintering temperature, and for the 2DD or 3DD TGG processes. As already confirmed in , the average grain size showed a steadily increasing tendency with increasing sintering temperature, regardless of the TGG process used. The difference in average grain size for both the 2DD and 3DD TGG processes at 900\xb0C was insignificant, but it dramatically increased when the sintering temperature was 950\xb0C. However, the grain-size gap declined when the sintering temperature further increased to 1000\xb0C. This result is attributed to the relatively limited thickness (\u223c17 \u03bcm) of the BT-template-free layers of the PNNZT ceramic textured by the 2DD TGG process. As shown in (b), most of the PNNZT epitaxial grains did not entirely grow during sintering at 950\xb0C. However, it was clearly detected that there were no untextured grains in the vicinity of the boundaries between a couple of epitaxial grains located along the vertical axis when the sintering temperature was 1000\xb0C. This means that the PNNZT grains in the BT-free layers were excessively textured along the upward and downward direction of the surface of each BT template. In other words, the two PNNZT grains epitaxially-growing while facing each other collided, and they couldn't grow anymore in the vertical direction. Therefore, since the template-free sheets were thicker than 17 \u03bcm, there is no doubt that the average size of the epitaxial PNNZT grains would be much greater under the sintering condition of 1000\xb0C. shows the dielectric constant (\u03b5 E^{T} 33/\u03b5 0) and piezoelectric properties of the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics textured by the 2DD TGG process, sintered at various temperatures from 900\xb0C to 1025\xb0C for 15 h. The \u03b5 E^{T} 33/\u03b5 0 values decreased steadily with increasing temperature to 1000\xb0C. However, it slightly improved when the sintering temperature reached 1025\xb0C. The piezoelectric properties of piezoelectric charge constant (d 33), electromechanical coupling factor (k p), and piezoelectric voltage constant (g 33) commonly showed a tendency opposite to that of the dielectric constant. They were maximized to 1334 pC/N, 92.4 %, and 38.5 \xd7 10E^{\u22123} V\u2219m/N, respectively, when the sintering temperature reached 1000\xb0C. In particular, the d 33 and k p values, comparable to those of well-known piezoelectric single crystals , were incredibly improved due to the strong texture degree developed in the PNNZT ceramic via the 2DD TGG process. Particularly considering that those piezoelectric single crystalline ceramics are achieved at a significantly high sintering temperature, near 1300\xb0C , the d 33 and k p values in the textured PNNZT ceramic sintered at temperatures below 1300\xb0C were much more impressive. All of the \u03b5 E^{T} 33/\u03b5 0 values and piezoelectric properties of the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics textured by the 2DD TGG process are summarized in detail, in. shows the temperature-dependent dielectric constant and dielectric loss for untextured PNNZT ceramics and BT-templated PNNZT ceramics textured using the 3DD and 2DD TGG processes. All samples were sintered at 1000\xb0C for 15 h. The untextured PNNZT ceramic exhibited a temperature at maximum dielectric constant (T m) of 153.8\xb0C at 1 kHz. In comparison, the BT-templated PNNZT ceramics textured via the 3DD and 2DD TGG processes showed slightly lower T m values of 146.4\xb0C and 146.6\xb0C. This reduction in T m is attributed to the low Curie temperature (\u223c120\xb0C) of the BT templates. At room temperature, the dielectric loss values for all samples were low, remaining below 0.05. The T m values of PNNZT ceramics textured using the 2DD and 3DD TGG processes were nearly identical, despite differences in the alignment of BT templates. This result indicates that the alignment of BT templates does not significantly influence the dielectric response of textured PNNZT ceramics. The unipolar strain vs. electric field (S-E) plots of the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics textured using the 2DD TGG process, sintered at various temperatures from 900\xb0C to 1025\xb0C for 15 h, are shown in. The inset shows the large signal piezoelectric coefficient (d 33 E^{\u2217}), where d 33 E^{\u2217} indicating the ratio of maximum S (S max) to maximum E (E max) was obtained at a maximum electric field of 1 kV/mm from the unipolar S-E plot. As the sintering temperature increased from 900\xb0C to 1000\xb0C, d 33 E^{\u2217} exhibited an increasing tendency from 1120 pm/V to 1409 pm/V. Although the d 33 E^{\u2217} value slightly deteriorated to 1291 pm/V when the sintering temperature was further increased to 1025\xb0C, it should be noticed that all the d 33 E^{\u2217} values are incredibly high, considering the significantly low sintering temperature range. The sintering temperature-dependent tendency of d 33 E^{\u2217} is similar to that of piezoelectric d 33, k p, and g 33, as shown in. Probably, it was associated with f L as a function of sintering temperature, in which the texture degree of the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramic has a close relationship with the piezoelectric response affected by polarization rotation. shows the normalized values of \u03b5 E^{T} 33/\u03b5 0, d 33, k p, g 33, and Q m for the untextured PNNZT ceramic and the BT-templated PNNZT ceramics textured by the 3DD and 2DD TGG processes. The dielectric and piezoelectric properties of the untextured and textured PNNZT ceramics fabricated with a conventional process can be obtained from our previous report  since most of the experimental conditions used to fabricate them, including sintering temperature and sintering time, are identical to those of the 2DD TGG process proposed in this work. All of the data compared in were obtained from the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics fabricated under the same sintering conditions at a temperature of 1000\xb0C and holding time of 15 h. It was insignificant for both the parameters of \u03b5 E^{T} 33/\u03b5 0 and Q m because the PNNZT ceramic textured by the 2DD TGG was comparable to those of the other untextured and conventionally textured PNNZT ceramics. However, it should be noted that the piezoelectric d 33, k p, and g 33 values were dramatically improved by as much as approximately 41%, 31%, and 83%, respectively, in comparison with those values of the untextured PNNZT ceramic. In particular, the reduced \u03b5 E^{T} 33/\u03b5 0 was responsible for the extreme increase in g 33 in the PNNZT ceramic fabricated using the 2DD TGG process, based on the relationship of g\u221dd/\u03b5. Furthermore, even when compared with the d 33, k p, and g 33 values of the PNNZT ceramic textured via the conventional 3DD TGG process, those of the PNNZT ceramic textured by the proposed TGG in this work were outstandingly strengthened, as indicated by the blue and green bars for the three parameters in the middle of. Therefore, it is considered that the 2DD TGG process proposed in this work can significantly contribute to a much higher degree of texture in piezoelectric ceramics, when supported by an equi-aligned template material. Polarization vs. electric field (P-E) hysteresis and unipolar strain vs. electric field (S-E) curves were also assessed to validate the effect of the 2DD TGG on the ferroelectric and electrostrain characteristics of the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramic. (a) and (b) exhibit the P-E hysteresis and S-E curves of the untextured PNNZT ceramic and the BT-templated PNNZT ceramics textured by the 3DD and 2DD TGG processes, sintered at 1000\xb0C for 15 h. It was found that all of the PNNZT ceramics exhibited typical ferroelectric characteristics, irrespective of texture degree, as shown in (a). Moreover, the remnant polarization (P r) slightly decreased but the coercive electric field (E c) increased when the BT templates were incorporated into the PNNZT ceramics. The addition of BT with a dielectric constant  much lower than that of PNNZT leads to degradation of the total P r value of the piezoelectric ceramic. However, changing the process from 3DD TGG to 2DD TGG allowed the P r value to increase and the E c value to decrease. The increased P r might be due to the highly improved d 33 value, based on a relationship between P r and d 33 in ferroelectric materials. The associated Eq.  is as follows: where Q 33 and \u03b5 33 are the electrostrictive coefficient and the dielectric permittivity. As already confirmed in , since the dielectric constants for those two cases were similar to each other, the dramatically increased d 33 would mainly contribute to the increase in P r. In case of E c, the enhanced degree of texture along the [001] direction exhibited by the PNNZT ceramic textured by the 2DD TGG process could promote domain movement and lead to the resultant decrease in E c. The inset table in (a) summarizes the 2P r and 2E c values for the given cases. For the electrostriction behavior shown in (b), it was also noticeable that the S max and d 33 E^{\u2217} values for the 2DD TGG case are much superior to those of the untextured and textured by conventional process. Details of the S max and d 33 E^{\u2217} values for all three types are also included in the inset in (b). As already shown in , it was confirmed that the PNNZT ceramic textured via the 2DD TGG process, had the highest strain of 0.138% at 1 kV/mm, corresponding to a d 33 E^{\u2217} value of 1409 pm/V. Despite the large electrostrain characteristic shown in (b), the piezoelectric strain of the piezoelectric actuator must be durable in the working conditions of the application. shows the large-signal d 33 E^{\u2217} value of the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics textured by the 2DD TGG process, sintered at 1000\xb0C for 15 h, as a function of working cycles. The unipolar strain vs. electric field (S-E) curves used for the extraction of the d 33 E^{\u2217} value are inset in. The fatigue testing was performed by applying a bipolar triangular field of 0.9 E c  and at 100 Hz up to 10E^{6} unipolar cycles. Although a monotonous fatigue behavior was present in the textured PNNZT piezoelectric ceramic, the degraded d 33 E^{\u2217} value was as low as 6.5% after 1 M cycles, suggesting that the textured PNNZT ceramic has excellent long lifetime potential for piezoelectric actuator devices.
