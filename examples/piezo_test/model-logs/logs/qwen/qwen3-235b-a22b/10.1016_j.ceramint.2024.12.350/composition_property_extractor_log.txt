# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
shows comparative schematic illustrations of conventional 3DD TGG and the proposed 2DD TGG processes for fabricating BT-templated PNNZT texture ceramics. A representative material image or cross-sectional image characterizing a meaningful aspect of the individual TGG process is included for each process step in. The left column in shows the 3DD TGG that can occur in a conventional TGG process when used to fabricate textured piezoelectric ceramics. In this work, the mixed slurry for the 3DD TGG process was prepared using the calcined PNNZT powders and the plate-like BT templates, along with several organic materials introduced in the experimental part. Then thick PNNZT green sheets containing the 3DD BT templates were produced by a conventional tape casting method. To fabricate the BT-templated PNNZT ceramic, the PNNZT green sheets with 3DD BT templates are stacked under high pressure to form a homogeneous piezoelectric ceramic laminate, and then they are sintered to make PNNZT texture ceramic. In contrast to the typical TGG process, the proposed TGG process in this work has different slurry, tape casting, and stacking process steps, as can be seen in the right column of. One is the BT template-free slurry with PNNZT and organic materials. The other is the BT template-included slurry with PNNZT and organic materials, which is almost identical to the typical TGG process except for its viscosity. Here, importantly, both the template-free and template-included slurries must be thoroughly controlled to make green sheets thinner than those produced by the typical 3DD TGG process. More importantly, the thickness of the PNNZT green sheet containing the BT templates should be extremely thin to properly arrange the two-dimensionally aligned BT platelets. Lastly, in the step of stacking, the heterogeneous BT-free and BT-included PNNZT green sheets are laminated alternately. As a result, the microstructure of the PNNZT textured ceramics developed after sintering can have clearly different grain morphologies, as shown in the cross-sectional images in the last column of. It's likely that the PNNZT grains epitaxially-grown from the misaligned BT templates with the 3DD TGG process might degrade the degree of texture in the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramic. Meanwhile, the equi-aligned BT templates produced by the proposed 2DD TGG process can result in a PNNZT ceramic with higher degrees of texture. In addition, by prohibiting collisions between neighboring growing PNNZT epitaxial grains, the BT-free PNNZT layers can support the independent growth of epitaxial PNNZT grains on the BT platelets with equi-axial alignment. To investigate the effects of 2DD TGG, XRD and FESEM structural analyses were carried out as follows. (a) shows XRD patterns of the textured PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics prepared with the 2DD TGG process as a function of sintering temperature from 900\xb0C to 1025\xb0C for 15 h with an interval of 25\xb0C. It was found that all of the PNNZT ceramics were successfully textured with a perovskite crystal symmetry without any secondary phase. The incredibly enhanced (001) and (002) peaks belonging to the {001} plane group and the deteriorated (101) plane provided obvious evidence that the PNNZT ceramics were strongly textured on the BT platelets, with a [001] orientation. The gradual enforcement of the {001} planes with increasing sintering temperature up to 1000 \xb0C, implies that the growth of the PNNZT grains along the [001] direction depend heavily on the increasing sintering temperature. However, when it exceeded 1000\xb0C, the peak intensities of the (001) and (002) planes were slightly degraded. In contrast, the variation in the intensity of the (101) peak near 32\xb0 showed a tendency opposite to that of the {001} plane group with increasing sintering temperature. These results indicate that the PNNZT ceramics are most strongly textured via the 2DD TGG process when the sintering temperature reaches 1000\xb0C. This is shown by the Lotgering factor (f L)  in (a), which can be expressed with the following Equations , where I(00l) and I 0 (00l) are the intensity of the (00l) reflection, I(hkl) and I 0 (hkl) are the intensity of the (hkl) reflection, and P and P 0 represent the textured and randomly oriented materials. The texture degree obtained from the PNNZT ceramic sintered at 1000\xb0C had the highest value of 94%. To examine the effect of the 2DD TGG process enhancement on the texture degree of the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics, the f L values of the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics prepared by the conventional 3DD and the proposed 2DD TGG processes were compared as a function of sintering temperature from 900\xb0C to 1025\xb0C. More details, including f L for the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics prepared with the conventional TGG process can be obtained in our previous report. All of the f L values obtained from the 2DD TGG case were higher than those of the 3DD TGG, as seen in (b). However, while the f L value of the PNNZT ceramic textured via the 2DD TGG process steadily increased, it slightly decreased when the sintering temperature exceeded 1000\xb0C, and the gap in f L for the different TGG processes was further enlarged. These results imply that the proposed TGG process using 2DD BT platelets in this work was much more effective at improving the texture of the PNNZT ceramics than the conventional 3DD TGG process. Cross-sectional FESEM images of the textured PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics sintered at 900\xb0C, 950\xb0C, and 1000\xb0C, prepared using the proposed 2DD and conventional 3DD TGG processes, respectively, are comparatively shown in (a)\u2013(c). It seems that all of the ceramics were highly densified and successfully textured by sintering at the given temperature condition, since many epitaxial grains grew on the seed crystals of the BT platelets in most regions in each PNNZT ceramic. It was also obvious that the epitaxially-grown PNNZT grains became significantly larger with increasing sintering temperature from 900\xb0C to 950\xb0C [see (a) and (b)]. When the sintering temperature was further increased to 1000\xb0C, the cross-sections of both specimens were nearly covered by the texture grains, as shown in (c). While this morphological structure evolved with the increase in sintering temperature, the growth of the PNNZT matrix grains was insignificant. This phenomenon confirms that the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramic can be well textured even at the sintering temperatures below 1025\xb0C. However, notably, the morphological evolution was clearly differentiated in the microstructures of both specimens as they evolved via the proposed 2DD and conventional 3DD TGG processes. Under the proposed 2DD TGG process, the highly equi-aligned BT templates allowed the small PNNZT matrix grains to move around the BT and thereafter, to grow epitaxially on it without any interruption from neighboring misaligned BT-templated grains [see the right column images in ]. However, it is clear that the developed epitaxial PNNZT grains were distributed in a relatively random arrangement under the conventional 3DD TGG process. Moreover, some of the PNNZT epitaxial grains growing on the misaligned BT platelets seem to hinder the other epitaxial grains growing on neighbors, as marked by the yellow dotted boxes in the left column images in. As a consequence, to achieve highly textured piezoelectric ceramics, the 2DD TGG process proposed in this work is recommended. To address the temperature-dependent growth behavior of the BT-templated PNNZT epitaxial grains, the characteristic grain size was deeply analyzed, based on the epitaxially-grown grains and the untextured matrix grains in the cross-sectional FESEM image at each sintering temperature. The grain size distribution in the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics, textured by the conventional 3DD TGG and proposed 2DD TGG processes, was examined for various sintering temperatures of 900\xb0C, 950\xb0C, and 1000\xb0C, as shown in (a). 120 epitaxial grains for each of the different sintering temperatures were analyzed to plot the distribution data. The grain size of an epitaxial PNNZT grain was measured along the vertical and lateral directions, excluding the dimensions of the BT template, as shown in the inset image of (a). The resultant average grain size of the PNNZT epitaxial grains is also shown in (b), along with average grain size of the PNNZT grains in the untextured region, which was measured using the line intercept method. It was found that the epitaxial grain growth in the vertical direction was preferred to that of the lateral direction under all conditions such as sintering temperature, and for the 2DD or 3DD TGG processes. As already confirmed in , the average grain size showed a steadily increasing tendency with increasing sintering temperature, regardless of the TGG process used. The difference in average grain size for both the 2DD and 3DD TGG processes at 900\xb0C was insignificant, but it dramatically increased when the sintering temperature was 950\xb0C. However, the grain-size gap declined when the sintering temperature further increased to 1000\xb0C. This result is attributed to the relatively limited thickness (\u223c17 \u03bcm) of the BT-template-free layers of the PNNZT ceramic textured by the 2DD TGG process. As shown in (b), most of the PNNZT epitaxial grains did not entirely grow during sintering at 950\xb0C. However, it was clearly detected that there were no untextured grains in the vicinity of the boundaries between a couple of epitaxial grains located along the vertical axis when the sintering temperature was 1000\xb0C. This means that the PNNZT grains in the BT-free layers were excessively textured along the upward and downward direction of the surface of each BT template. In other words, the two PNNZT grains epitaxially-growing while facing each other collided, and they couldn't grow anymore in the vertical direction. Therefore, since the template-free sheets were thicker than 17 \u03bcm, there is no doubt that the average size of the epitaxial PNNZT grains would be much greater under the sintering condition of 1000\xb0C. shows the dielectric constant (\u03b5 E^{T} 33/\u03b5 0) and piezoelectric properties of the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics textured by the 2DD TGG process, sintered at various temperatures from 900\xb0C to 1025\xb0C for 15 h. The \u03b5 E^{T} 33/\u03b5 0 values decreased steadily with increasing temperature to 1000\xb0C. However, it slightly improved when the sintering temperature reached 1025\xb0C. The piezoelectric properties of piezoelectric charge constant (d 33), electromechanical coupling factor (k p), and piezoelectric voltage constant (g 33) commonly showed a tendency opposite to that of the dielectric constant. They were maximized to 1334 pC/N, 92.4 %, and 38.5 \xd7 10E^{\u22123} V\u2219m/N, respectively, when the sintering temperature reached 1000\xb0C. In particular, the d 33 and k p values, comparable to those of well-known piezoelectric single crystals , were incredibly improved due to the strong texture degree developed in the PNNZT ceramic via the 2DD TGG process. Particularly considering that those piezoelectric single crystalline ceramics are achieved at a significantly high sintering temperature, near 1300\xb0C , the d 33 and k p values in the textured PNNZT ceramic sintered at temperatures below 1300\xb0C were much more impressive. All of the \u03b5 E^{T} 33/\u03b5 0 values and piezoelectric properties of the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics textured by the 2DD TGG process are summarized in detail, in. shows the temperature-dependent dielectric constant and dielectric loss for untextured PNNZT ceramics and BT-templated PNNZT ceramics textured using the 3DD and 2DD TGG processes. All samples were sintered at 1000\xb0C for 15 h. The untextured PNNZT ceramic exhibited a temperature at maximum dielectric constant (T m) of 153.8\xb0C at 1 kHz. In comparison, the BT-templated PNNZT ceramics textured via the 3DD and 2DD TGG processes showed slightly lower T m values of 146.4\xb0C and 146.6\xb0C. This reduction in T m is attributed to the low Curie temperature (\u223c120\xb0C) of the BT templates. At room temperature, the dielectric loss values for all samples were low, remaining below 0.05. The T m values of PNNZT ceramics textured using the 2DD and 3DD TGG processes were nearly identical, despite differences in the alignment of BT templates. This result indicates that the alignment of BT templates does not significantly influence the dielectric response of textured PNNZT ceramics. The unipolar strain vs. electric field (S-E) plots of the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics textured using the 2DD TGG process, sintered at various temperatures from 900\xb0C to 1025\xb0C for 15 h, are shown in. The inset shows the large signal piezoelectric coefficient (d 33 E^{\u2217}), where d 33 E^{\u2217} indicating the ratio of maximum S (S max) to maximum E (E max) was obtained at a maximum electric field of 1 kV/mm from the unipolar S-E plot. As the sintering temperature increased from 900\xb0C to 1000\xb0C, d 33 E^{\u2217} exhibited an increasing tendency from 1120 pm/V to 1409 pm/V. Although the d 33 E^{\u2217} value slightly deteriorated to 1291 pm/V when the sintering temperature was further increased to 1025\xb0C, it should be noticed that all the d 33 E^{\u2217} values are incredibly high, considering the significantly low sintering temperature range. The sintering temperature-dependent tendency of d 33 E^{\u2217} is similar to that of piezoelectric d 33, k p, and g 33, as shown in. Probably, it was associated with f L as a function of sintering temperature, in which the texture degree of the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramic has a close relationship with the piezoelectric response affected by polarization rotation. shows the normalized values of \u03b5 E^{T} 33/\u03b5 0, d 33, k p, g 33, and Q m for the untextured PNNZT ceramic and the BT-templated PNNZT ceramics textured by the 3DD and 2DD TGG processes. The dielectric and piezoelectric properties of the untextured and textured PNNZT ceramics fabricated with a conventional process can be obtained from our previous report  since most of the experimental conditions used to fabricate them, including sintering temperature and sintering time, are identical to those of the 2DD TGG process proposed in this work. All of the data compared in were obtained from the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics fabricated under the same sintering conditions at a temperature of 1000\xb0C and holding time of 15 h. It was insignificant for both the parameters of \u03b5 E^{T} 33/\u03b5 0 and Q m because the PNNZT ceramic textured by the 2DD TGG was comparable to those of the other untextured and conventionally textured PNNZT ceramics. However, it should be noted that the piezoelectric d 33, k p, and g 33 values were dramatically improved by as much as approximately 41%, 31%, and 83%, respectively, in comparison with those values of the untextured PNNZT ceramic. In particular, the reduced \u03b5 E^{T} 33/\u03b5 0 was responsible for the extreme increase in g 33 in the PNNZT ceramic fabricated using the 2DD TGG process, based on the relationship of g\u221dd/\u03b5. Furthermore, even when compared with the d 33, k p, and g 33 values of the PNNZT ceramic textured via the conventional 3DD TGG process, those of the PNNZT ceramic textured by the proposed TGG in this work were outstandingly strengthened, as indicated by the blue and green bars for the three parameters in the middle of. Therefore, it is considered that the 2DD TGG process proposed in this work can significantly contribute to a much higher degree of texture in piezoelectric ceramics, when supported by an equi-aligned template material. Polarization vs. electric field (P-E) hysteresis and unipolar strain vs. electric field (S-E) curves were also assessed to validate the effect of the 2DD TGG on the ferroelectric and electrostrain characteristics of the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramic. (a) and (b) exhibit the P-E hysteresis and S-E curves of the untextured PNNZT ceramic and the BT-templated PNNZT ceramics textured by the 3DD and 2DD TGG processes, sintered at 1000\xb0C for 15 h. It was found that all of the PNNZT ceramics exhibited typical ferroelectric characteristics, irrespective of texture degree, as shown in (a). Moreover, the remnant polarization (P r) slightly decreased but the coercive electric field (E c) increased when the BT templates were incorporated into the PNNZT ceramics. The addition of BT with a dielectric constant  much lower than that of PNNZT leads to degradation of the total P r value of the piezoelectric ceramic. However, changing the process from 3DD TGG to 2DD TGG allowed the P r value to increase and the E c value to decrease. The increased P r might be due to the highly improved d 33 value, based on a relationship between P r and d 33 in ferroelectric materials. The associated Eq.  is as follows: where Q 33 and \u03b5 33 are the electrostrictive coefficient and the dielectric permittivity. As already confirmed in , since the dielectric constants for those two cases were similar to each other, the dramatically increased d 33 would mainly contribute to the increase in P r. In case of E c, the enhanced degree of texture along the [001] direction exhibited by the PNNZT ceramic textured by the 2DD TGG process could promote domain movement and lead to the resultant decrease in E c. The inset table in (a) summarizes the 2P r and 2E c values for the given cases. For the electrostriction behavior shown in (b), it was also noticeable that the S max and d 33 E^{\u2217} values for the 2DD TGG case are much superior to those of the untextured and textured by conventional process. Details of the S max and d 33 E^{\u2217} values for all three types are also included in the inset in (b). As already shown in , it was confirmed that the PNNZT ceramic textured via the 2DD TGG process, had the highest strain of 0.138% at 1 kV/mm, corresponding to a d 33 E^{\u2217} value of 1409 pm/V. Despite the large electrostrain characteristic shown in (b), the piezoelectric strain of the piezoelectric actuator must be durable in the working conditions of the application. shows the large-signal d 33 E^{\u2217} value of the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics textured by the 2DD TGG process, sintered at 1000\xb0C for 15 h, as a function of working cycles. The unipolar strain vs. electric field (S-E) curves used for the extraction of the d 33 E^{\u2217} value are inset in. The fatigue testing was performed by applying a bipolar triangular field of 0.9 E c  and at 100 Hz up to 10E^{6} unipolar cycles. Although a monotonous fatigue behavior was present in the textured PNNZT piezoelectric ceramic, the degraded d 33 E^{\u2217} value was as low as 6.5% after 1 M cycles, suggesting that the textured PNNZT ceramic has excellent long lifetime potential for piezoelectric actuator devices.

# ABSTRACT
A two-dimensionally-dispersed template grain growth (2DD TGG) method is proposed for making piezoelectric 0.5Pb(Ni1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.16PbZrO3-0.34PbTiO3 (PNNZT) ceramics, textured using highly equi-aligned BaTiO3 (BT) templates. Unlike a conventional TGG process, the 2DD TGG utilizes both BT-free and BT-included piezoelectric layers, which are laminated alternately. A significantly high texture degree of 94% was obtained for the PNNZT ceramic textured by the 2DD TGG when sintered at 1000Â°C for 15Â h.

# INTRODUCTION
Typically, despite its poor piezoelectric characteristics, BaTiO3 (BT) micro-platelets  have been used as a template material to make piezoelectric textured ceramics. The lattice parameter of BT is similar to that of a specific phase of Pb-related complex piezoelectric ceramics with a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB). Many previous reports on piezoelectric textured ceramics  have reported that BT platelets are highly useful for developing a preferred (001) orientation in piezoelectric crystals. In general, a tape-casting process is carried out to fabricate piezoelectric ceramic sheets for the template grain growth (TGG) in which plate-like BT ceramic is widely used as a template material. However, the BT templates, randomly-dispersed in piezoelectric ceramic slurry, are not easy to be equi-axially arranged on a sheet during tape-casting. BT templates with a low aspect ratio of width to thickness might be placed along a direction perpendicular to the casting direction. Thus, creating an equi-axial alignment of templates is considered to be one of the most critical factors to achieve highly textured piezoelectric ceramics in the TGG process. In addition, in piezoelectric textured ceramics, clusters and non-parallel alignments of the templated BT platelets  may lead to significant deterioration of performance in piezoelectric devices. Liu et al. have recently reported that 0.05Pb(Mn1/3Sb2/3)O3-0.95[0.4Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.25PbZrO3-0.35PbTiO3] piezoelectric ceramics could be successfully textured by incorporation of 5 wt% BT templates; resulting materials showed d 33 value of 445 pC/N and Q m value of 824. Bian et al. demonstrated that 0.42Pb(Ni1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.21PbZrO3-0.37PbTiO3 textured ceramics with 2 vol% BT templates had excellent piezoelectric performance (d 33=910 pC/N, k p=74.5%), along with a high texture degree (f L) of 89%. Zate et al. introduced 0.4Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.22PbZrO3-0.38PbTiO3 ceramics with 3 vol% BT templates that were highly crystallized with a (001) preferred orientation, corresponding to a f L value of 90%. Most recently, Zhang et al. reported that piezoelectric properties were extremely enhanced by the addition of BT templates to Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbZrO3-PbTiO3 piezoelectric ceramics, subsequently achieving highly textured ceramic morphology. However, prior studies commonly observed tilted BT templates, which negatively impact the piezoelectric properties. In particular, if a couple of neighboring BT platelets are misaligned inside the piezoelectric ceramic green sheet, they will negatively affect the full growth of the matrix piezoelectric crystal epitaxially-growing on the BT, by hindering grain growth during sintering. In addition, the incorrectly aligned texture grains do not help improve the electromechanical properties of piezoelectric ceramics prepared using the TGG process. For high performance piezoelectric device applications, it is necessary to ensure the BT templates are equi-axially well-aligned into the piezoelectric matrix ceramic. This work introduces a two-dimensionally dispersed template grain growth (2DD TGG) process to achieve high quality piezoelectric texture ceramics, for application in piezoelectric actuator devices. To investigate the feasibility of the 2DD TGG process, two kinds of piezoelectric 0.5Pb(Ni1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.16PbZrO3-0.34PbTiO3 + Li2CO3 (PNNZT) green sheets were prepared. One was a BT-template-free thick sheet, and the other a BT-template-included thin sheet. The heterogeneous sheets were laminated and successfully sintered at various temperatures for the PNNZT texture ceramics. Then their microstructural evolution and piezoelectric properties were systematically investigated and compared with those of PNNZT ceramics textured by a conventional three-dimensionally dispersed template grain growth (3DD TGG). Electrostrain characteristics were also investigated to assess the potential of the PNNZT ceramic textured via 2DD TGG for piezoelectric actuator devices.

# CONCLUSION
This study successfully introduced the 2DD TGG method to address the inherent limitations of the 3DD TGG approach, namely clustering and misalignment of BT templates. By fabricating thin green sheets, the BT templates were aligned uniformly along the casting direction, effectively eliminating unparallel orientations. The alternating lamination of these BT template sheets with BT-free sheets ensured sufficient spacing between templates, enabling the growth of larger textured grains. Compared to those textured via 3DD TGG PNNZT, ceramics textured via 2DD TGG exhibited significantly higher f L values across the entire range of sintering temperatures. The highest f L value of 94% was achieved at a sintering temperature of 1000\xb0C. The epitaxial grain growth showed a clear dependence on sintering temperature, with grain size increasing alongside the increase in temperature from 900\xb0C to 1000\xb0C, paralleling the trend in the f L observed in XRD patterns. In contrast, the tilted and clustered BT templates in 3DD TGG-textured PNNZT ceramics led to collisions between epitaxially grown grains, resulting in comparatively lower f L values. The optimized microstructure of PNNZT ceramics textured via 2DD TGG resulted in exceptional piezoelectric properties, including high d 33 value of 1334 pC/N, k p value of 92.4%, g 33 value of 38.5 \xd7 10E^{\u22123} V\u2219m/N, and d 33\u2217 value of 1409 pm/V, all measured at a sintering temperature of 1000\xb0C. Compared to those of the untextured ceramics, the BT-templated PNNZT ceramics processed via both 3DD and 2DD TGG exhibited slightly reduced T m values of 146.4\xb0C and 146.6\xb0C. In P-E hysteresis analysis, the PNNZT ceramics textured by 2DD TGG demonstrated a higher P r value and lower E c value than those of their 3DD TGG counterparts. These factors contributed significantly to the enhanced d 33\u2217 values observed in the 2DD TGG ceramics. Moreover, the 2DD TGG-textured PNNZT ceramics exhibited excellent fatigue resistance, with only 6.5% degradation in d 33 E^{\u2217} after 10E^{6} cycles. Therefore, the 2DD TGG method represents a significant advance in the fabrication of high-performance piezoelectric ceramics, effectively overcoming the limitations of 3DD TGG and achieving superior microstructural, piezoelectric, and fatigue properties.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
shows comparative schematic illustrations of conventional 3DD TGG and the proposed 2DD TGG processes for fabricating BT-templated PNNZT texture ceramics. A representative material image or cross-sectional image characterizing a meaningful aspect of the individual TGG process is included for each process step in. The left column in shows the 3DD TGG that can occur in a conventional TGG process when used to fabricate textured piezoelectric ceramics. In this work, the mixed slurry for the 3DD TGG process was prepared using the calcined PNNZT powders and the plate-like BT templates, along with several organic materials introduced in the experimental part. Then thick PNNZT green sheets containing the 3DD BT templates were produced by a conventional tape casting method. To fabricate the BT-templated PNNZT ceramic, the PNNZT green sheets with 3DD BT templates are stacked under high pressure to form a homogeneous piezoelectric ceramic laminate, and then they are sintered to make PNNZT texture ceramic. In contrast to the typical TGG process, the proposed TGG process in this work has different slurry, tape casting, and stacking process steps, as can be seen in the right column of. One is the BT template-free slurry with PNNZT and organic materials. The other is the BT template-included slurry with PNNZT and organic materials, which is almost identical to the typical TGG process except for its viscosity. Here, importantly, both the template-free and template-included slurries must be thoroughly controlled to make green sheets thinner than those produced by the typical 3DD TGG process. More importantly, the thickness of the PNNZT green sheet containing the BT templates should be extremely thin to properly arrange the two-dimensionally aligned BT platelets. Lastly, in the step of stacking, the heterogeneous BT-free and BT-included PNNZT green sheets are laminated alternately. As a result, the microstructure of the PNNZT textured ceramics developed after sintering can have clearly different grain morphologies, as shown in the cross-sectional images in the last column of. It's likely that the PNNZT grains epitaxially-grown from the misaligned BT templates with the 3DD TGG process might degrade the degree of texture in the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramic. Meanwhile, the equi-aligned BT templates produced by the proposed 2DD TGG process can result in a PNNZT ceramic with higher degrees of texture. In addition, by prohibiting collisions between neighboring growing PNNZT epitaxial grains, the BT-free PNNZT layers can support the independent growth of epitaxial PNNZT grains on the BT platelets with equi-axial alignment. To investigate the effects of 2DD TGG, XRD and FESEM structural analyses were carried out as follows. (a) shows XRD patterns of the textured PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics prepared with the 2DD TGG process as a function of sintering temperature from 900\xb0C to 1025\xb0C for 15 h with an interval of 25\xb0C. It was found that all of the PNNZT ceramics were successfully textured with a perovskite crystal symmetry without any secondary phase. The incredibly enhanced (001) and (002) peaks belonging to the {001} plane group and the deteriorated (101) plane provided obvious evidence that the PNNZT ceramics were strongly textured on the BT platelets, with a [001] orientation. The gradual enforcement of the {001} planes with increasing sintering temperature up to 1000 \xb0C, implies that the growth of the PNNZT grains along the [001] direction depend heavily on the increasing sintering temperature. However, when it exceeded 1000\xb0C, the peak intensities of the (001) and (002) planes were slightly degraded. In contrast, the variation in the intensity of the (101) peak near 32\xb0 showed a tendency opposite to that of the {001} plane group with increasing sintering temperature. These results indicate that the PNNZT ceramics are most strongly textured via the 2DD TGG process when the sintering temperature reaches 1000\xb0C. This is shown by the Lotgering factor (f L)  in (a), which can be expressed with the following Equations , where I(00l) and I 0 (00l) are the intensity of the (00l) reflection, I(hkl) and I 0 (hkl) are the intensity of the (hkl) reflection, and P and P 0 represent the textured and randomly oriented materials. The texture degree obtained from the PNNZT ceramic sintered at 1000\xb0C had the highest value of 94%. To examine the effect of the 2DD TGG process enhancement on the texture degree of the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics, the f L values of the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics prepared by the conventional 3DD and the proposed 2DD TGG processes were compared as a function of sintering temperature from 900\xb0C to 1025\xb0C. More details, including f L for the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics prepared with the conventional TGG process can be obtained in our previous report. All of the f L values obtained from the 2DD TGG case were higher than those of the 3DD TGG, as seen in (b). However, while the f L value of the PNNZT ceramic textured via the 2DD TGG process steadily increased, it slightly decreased when the sintering temperature exceeded 1000\xb0C, and the gap in f L for the different TGG processes was further enlarged. These results imply that the proposed TGG process using 2DD BT platelets in this work was much more effective at improving the texture of the PNNZT ceramics than the conventional 3DD TGG process. Cross-sectional FESEM images of the textured PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics sintered at 900\xb0C, 950\xb0C, and 1000\xb0C, prepared using the proposed 2DD and conventional 3DD TGG processes, respectively, are comparatively shown in (a)\u2013(c). It seems that all of the ceramics were highly densified and successfully textured by sintering at the given temperature condition, since many epitaxial grains grew on the seed crystals of the BT platelets in most regions in each PNNZT ceramic. It was also obvious that the epitaxially-grown PNNZT grains became significantly larger with increasing sintering temperature from 900\xb0C to 950\xb0C [see (a) and (b)]. When the sintering temperature was further increased to 1000\xb0C, the cross-sections of both specimens were nearly covered by the texture grains, as shown in (c). While this morphological structure evolved with the increase in sintering temperature, the growth of the PNNZT matrix grains was insignificant. This phenomenon confirms that the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramic can be well textured even at the sintering temperatures below 1025\xb0C. However, notably, the morphological evolution was clearly differentiated in the microstructures of both specimens as they evolved via the proposed 2DD and conventional 3DD TGG processes. Under the proposed 2DD TGG process, the highly equi-aligned BT templates allowed the small PNNZT matrix grains to move around the BT and thereafter, to grow epitaxially on it without any interruption from neighboring misaligned BT-templated grains [see the right column images in ]. However, it is clear that the developed epitaxial PNNZT grains were distributed in a relatively random arrangement under the conventional 3DD TGG process. Moreover, some of the PNNZT epitaxial grains growing on the misaligned BT platelets seem to hinder the other epitaxial grains growing on neighbors, as marked by the yellow dotted boxes in the left column images in. As a consequence, to achieve highly textured piezoelectric ceramics, the 2DD TGG process proposed in this work is recommended. To address the temperature-dependent growth behavior of the BT-templated PNNZT epitaxial grains, the characteristic grain size was deeply analyzed, based on the epitaxially-grown grains and the untextured matrix grains in the cross-sectional FESEM image at each sintering temperature. The grain size distribution in the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics, textured by the conventional 3DD TGG and proposed 2DD TGG processes, was examined for various sintering temperatures of 900\xb0C, 950\xb0C, and 1000\xb0C, as shown in (a). 120 epitaxial grains for each of the different sintering temperatures were analyzed to plot the distribution data. The grain size of an epitaxial PNNZT grain was measured along the vertical and lateral directions, excluding the dimensions of the BT template, as shown in the inset image of (a). The resultant average grain size of the PNNZT epitaxial grains is also shown in (b), along with average grain size of the PNNZT grains in the untextured region, which was measured using the line intercept method. It was found that the epitaxial grain growth in the vertical direction was preferred to that of the lateral direction under all conditions such as sintering temperature, and for the 2DD or 3DD TGG processes. As already confirmed in , the average grain size showed a steadily increasing tendency with increasing sintering temperature, regardless of the TGG process used. The difference in average grain size for both the 2DD and 3DD TGG processes at 900\xb0C was insignificant, but it dramatically increased when the sintering temperature was 950\xb0C. However, the grain-size gap declined when the sintering temperature further increased to 1000\xb0C. This result is attributed to the relatively limited thickness (\u223c17 \u03bcm) of the BT-template-free layers of the PNNZT ceramic textured by the 2DD TGG process. As shown in (b), most of the PNNZT epitaxial grains did not entirely grow during sintering at 950\xb0C. However, it was clearly detected that there were no untextured grains in the vicinity of the boundaries between a couple of epitaxial grains located along the vertical axis when the sintering temperature was 1000\xb0C. This means that the PNNZT grains in the BT-free layers were excessively textured along the upward and downward direction of the surface of each BT template. In other words, the two PNNZT grains epitaxially-growing while facing each other collided, and they couldn't grow anymore in the vertical direction. Therefore, since the template-free sheets were thicker than 17 \u03bcm, there is no doubt that the average size of the epitaxial PNNZT grains would be much greater under the sintering condition of 1000\xb0C. shows the dielectric constant (\u03b5 E^{T} 33/\u03b5 0) and piezoelectric properties of the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics textured by the 2DD TGG process, sintered at various temperatures from 900\xb0C to 1025\xb0C for 15 h. The \u03b5 E^{T} 33/\u03b5 0 values decreased steadily with increasing temperature to 1000\xb0C. However, it slightly improved when the sintering temperature reached 1025\xb0C. The piezoelectric properties of piezoelectric charge constant (d 33), electromechanical coupling factor (k p), and piezoelectric voltage constant (g 33) commonly showed a tendency opposite to that of the dielectric constant. They were maximized to 1334 pC/N, 92.4 %, and 38.5 \xd7 10E^{\u22123} V\u2219m/N, respectively, when the sintering temperature reached 1000\xb0C. In particular, the d 33 and k p values, comparable to those of well-known piezoelectric single crystals , were incredibly improved due to the strong texture degree developed in the PNNZT ceramic via the 2DD TGG process. Particularly considering that those piezoelectric single crystalline ceramics are achieved at a significantly high sintering temperature, near 1300\xb0C , the d 33 and k p values in the textured PNNZT ceramic sintered at temperatures below 1300\xb0C were much more impressive. All of the \u03b5 E^{T} 33/\u03b5 0 values and piezoelectric properties of the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics textured by the 2DD TGG process are summarized in detail, in. shows the temperature-dependent dielectric constant and dielectric loss for untextured PNNZT ceramics and BT-templated PNNZT ceramics textured using the 3DD and 2DD TGG processes. All samples were sintered at 1000\xb0C for 15 h. The untextured PNNZT ceramic exhibited a temperature at maximum dielectric constant (T m) of 153.8\xb0C at 1 kHz. In comparison, the BT-templated PNNZT ceramics textured via the 3DD and 2DD TGG processes showed slightly lower T m values of 146.4\xb0C and 146.6\xb0C. This reduction in T m is attributed to the low Curie temperature (\u223c120\xb0C) of the BT templates. At room temperature, the dielectric loss values for all samples were low, remaining below 0.05. The T m values of PNNZT ceramics textured using the 2DD and 3DD TGG processes were nearly identical, despite differences in the alignment of BT templates. This result indicates that the alignment of BT templates does not significantly influence the dielectric response of textured PNNZT ceramics. The unipolar strain vs. electric field (S-E) plots of the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics textured using the 2DD TGG process, sintered at various temperatures from 900\xb0C to 1025\xb0C for 15 h, are shown in. The inset shows the large signal piezoelectric coefficient (d 33 E^{\u2217}), where d 33 E^{\u2217} indicating the ratio of maximum S (S max) to maximum E (E max) was obtained at a maximum electric field of 1 kV/mm from the unipolar S-E plot. As the sintering temperature increased from 900\xb0C to 1000\xb0C, d 33 E^{\u2217} exhibited an increasing tendency from 1120 pm/V to 1409 pm/V. Although the d 33 E^{\u2217} value slightly deteriorated to 1291 pm/V when the sintering temperature was further increased to 1025\xb0C, it should be noticed that all the d 33 E^{\u2217} values are incredibly high, considering the significantly low sintering temperature range. The sintering temperature-dependent tendency of d 33 E^{\u2217} is similar to that of piezoelectric d 33, k p, and g 33, as shown in. Probably, it was associated with f L as a function of sintering temperature, in which the texture degree of the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramic has a close relationship with the piezoelectric response affected by polarization rotation. shows the normalized values of \u03b5 E^{T} 33/\u03b5 0, d 33, k p, g 33, and Q m for the untextured PNNZT ceramic and the BT-templated PNNZT ceramics textured by the 3DD and 2DD TGG processes. The dielectric and piezoelectric properties of the untextured and textured PNNZT ceramics fabricated with a conventional process can be obtained from our previous report  since most of the experimental conditions used to fabricate them, including sintering temperature and sintering time, are identical to those of the 2DD TGG process proposed in this work. All of the data compared in were obtained from the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics fabricated under the same sintering conditions at a temperature of 1000\xb0C and holding time of 15 h. It was insignificant for both the parameters of \u03b5 E^{T} 33/\u03b5 0 and Q m because the PNNZT ceramic textured by the 2DD TGG was comparable to those of the other untextured and conventionally textured PNNZT ceramics. However, it should be noted that the piezoelectric d 33, k p, and g 33 values were dramatically improved by as much as approximately 41%, 31%, and 83%, respectively, in comparison with those values of the untextured PNNZT ceramic. In particular, the reduced \u03b5 E^{T} 33/\u03b5 0 was responsible for the extreme increase in g 33 in the PNNZT ceramic fabricated using the 2DD TGG process, based on the relationship of g\u221dd/\u03b5. Furthermore, even when compared with the d 33, k p, and g 33 values of the PNNZT ceramic textured via the conventional 3DD TGG process, those of the PNNZT ceramic textured by the proposed TGG in this work were outstandingly strengthened, as indicated by the blue and green bars for the three parameters in the middle of. Therefore, it is considered that the 2DD TGG process proposed in this work can significantly contribute to a much higher degree of texture in piezoelectric ceramics, when supported by an equi-aligned template material. Polarization vs. electric field (P-E) hysteresis and unipolar strain vs. electric field (S-E) curves were also assessed to validate the effect of the 2DD TGG on the ferroelectric and electrostrain characteristics of the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramic. (a) and (b) exhibit the P-E hysteresis and S-E curves of the untextured PNNZT ceramic and the BT-templated PNNZT ceramics textured by the 3DD and 2DD TGG processes, sintered at 1000\xb0C for 15 h. It was found that all of the PNNZT ceramics exhibited typical ferroelectric characteristics, irrespective of texture degree, as shown in (a). Moreover, the remnant polarization (P r) slightly decreased but the coercive electric field (E c) increased when the BT templates were incorporated into the PNNZT ceramics. The addition of BT with a dielectric constant  much lower than that of PNNZT leads to degradation of the total P r value of the piezoelectric ceramic. However, changing the process from 3DD TGG to 2DD TGG allowed the P r value to increase and the E c value to decrease. The increased P r might be due to the highly improved d 33 value, based on a relationship between P r and d 33 in ferroelectric materials. The associated Eq.  is as follows: where Q 33 and \u03b5 33 are the electrostrictive coefficient and the dielectric permittivity. As already confirmed in , since the dielectric constants for those two cases were similar to each other, the dramatically increased d 33 would mainly contribute to the increase in P r. In case of E c, the enhanced degree of texture along the [001] direction exhibited by the PNNZT ceramic textured by the 2DD TGG process could promote domain movement and lead to the resultant decrease in E c. The inset table in (a) summarizes the 2P r and 2E c values for the given cases. For the electrostriction behavior shown in (b), it was also noticeable that the S max and d 33 E^{\u2217} values for the 2DD TGG case are much superior to those of the untextured and textured by conventional process. Details of the S max and d 33 E^{\u2217} values for all three types are also included in the inset in (b). As already shown in , it was confirmed that the PNNZT ceramic textured via the 2DD TGG process, had the highest strain of 0.138% at 1 kV/mm, corresponding to a d 33 E^{\u2217} value of 1409 pm/V. Despite the large electrostrain characteristic shown in (b), the piezoelectric strain of the piezoelectric actuator must be durable in the working conditions of the application. shows the large-signal d 33 E^{\u2217} value of the PNNZT piezoelectric ceramics textured by the 2DD TGG process, sintered at 1000\xb0C for 15 h, as a function of working cycles. The unipolar strain vs. electric field (S-E) curves used for the extraction of the d 33 E^{\u2217} value are inset in. The fatigue testing was performed by applying a bipolar triangular field of 0.9 E c  and at 100 Hz up to 10E^{6} unipolar cycles. Although a monotonous fatigue behavior was present in the textured PNNZT piezoelectric ceramic, the degraded d 33 E^{\u2217} value was as low as 6.5% after 1 M cycles, suggesting that the textured PNNZT ceramic has excellent long lifetime potential for piezoelectric actuator devices.

# ABSTRACT
A two-dimensionally-dispersed template grain growth (2DD TGG) method is proposed for making piezoelectric 0.5Pb(Ni1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.16PbZrO3-0.34PbTiO3 (PNNZT) ceramics, textured using highly equi-aligned BaTiO3 (BT) templates. Unlike a conventional TGG process, the 2DD TGG utilizes both BT-free and BT-included piezoelectric layers, which are laminated alternately. A significantly high texture degree of 94% was obtained for the PNNZT ceramic textured by the 2DD TGG when sintered at 1000Â°C for 15Â h.

# INTRODUCTION
Typically, despite its poor piezoelectric characteristics, BaTiO3 (BT) micro-platelets  have been used as a template material to make piezoelectric textured ceramics. The lattice parameter of BT is similar to that of a specific phase of Pb-related complex piezoelectric ceramics with a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB). Many previous reports on piezoelectric textured ceramics  have reported that BT platelets are highly useful for developing a preferred (001) orientation in piezoelectric crystals. In general, a tape-casting process is carried out to fabricate piezoelectric ceramic sheets for the template grain growth (TGG) in which plate-like BT ceramic is widely used as a template material. However, the BT templates, randomly-dispersed in piezoelectric ceramic slurry, are not easy to be equi-axially arranged on a sheet during tape-casting. BT templates with a low aspect ratio of width to thickness might be placed along a direction perpendicular to the casting direction. Thus, creating an equi-axial alignment of templates is considered to be one of the most critical factors to achieve highly textured piezoelectric ceramics in the TGG process. In addition, in piezoelectric textured ceramics, clusters and non-parallel alignments of the templated BT platelets  may lead to significant deterioration of performance in piezoelectric devices. Liu et al. have recently reported that 0.05Pb(Mn1/3Sb2/3)O3-0.95[0.4Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.25PbZrO3-0.35PbTiO3] piezoelectric ceramics could be successfully textured by incorporation of 5 wt% BT templates; resulting materials showed d 33 value of 445 pC/N and Q m value of 824. Bian et al. demonstrated that 0.42Pb(Ni1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.21PbZrO3-0.37PbTiO3 textured ceramics with 2 vol% BT templates had excellent piezoelectric performance (d 33=910 pC/N, k p=74.5%), along with a high texture degree (f L) of 89%. Zate et al. introduced 0.4Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.22PbZrO3-0.38PbTiO3 ceramics with 3 vol% BT templates that were highly crystallized with a (001) preferred orientation, corresponding to a f L value of 90%. Most recently, Zhang et al. reported that piezoelectric properties were extremely enhanced by the addition of BT templates to Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbZrO3-PbTiO3 piezoelectric ceramics, subsequently achieving highly textured ceramic morphology. However, prior studies commonly observed tilted BT templates, which negatively impact the piezoelectric properties. In particular, if a couple of neighboring BT platelets are misaligned inside the piezoelectric ceramic green sheet, they will negatively affect the full growth of the matrix piezoelectric crystal epitaxially-growing on the BT, by hindering grain growth during sintering. In addition, the incorrectly aligned texture grains do not help improve the electromechanical properties of piezoelectric ceramics prepared using the TGG process. For high performance piezoelectric device applications, it is necessary to ensure the BT templates are equi-axially well-aligned into the piezoelectric matrix ceramic. This work introduces a two-dimensionally dispersed template grain growth (2DD TGG) process to achieve high quality piezoelectric texture ceramics, for application in piezoelectric actuator devices. To investigate the feasibility of the 2DD TGG process, two kinds of piezoelectric 0.5Pb(Ni1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.16PbZrO3-0.34PbTiO3 + Li2CO3 (PNNZT) green sheets were prepared. One was a BT-template-free thick sheet, and the other a BT-template-included thin sheet. The heterogeneous sheets were laminated and successfully sintered at various temperatures for the PNNZT texture ceramics. Then their microstructural evolution and piezoelectric properties were systematically investigated and compared with those of PNNZT ceramics textured by a conventional three-dimensionally dispersed template grain growth (3DD TGG). Electrostrain characteristics were also investigated to assess the potential of the PNNZT ceramic textured via 2DD TGG for piezoelectric actuator devices.

# CONCLUSION
This study successfully introduced the 2DD TGG method to address the inherent limitations of the 3DD TGG approach, namely clustering and misalignment of BT templates. By fabricating thin green sheets, the BT templates were aligned uniformly along the casting direction, effectively eliminating unparallel orientations. The alternating lamination of these BT template sheets with BT-free sheets ensured sufficient spacing between templates, enabling the growth of larger textured grains. Compared to those textured via 3DD TGG PNNZT, ceramics textured via 2DD TGG exhibited significantly higher f L values across the entire range of sintering temperatures. The highest f L value of 94% was achieved at a sintering temperature of 1000\xb0C. The epitaxial grain growth showed a clear dependence on sintering temperature, with grain size increasing alongside the increase in temperature from 900\xb0C to 1000\xb0C, paralleling the trend in the f L observed in XRD patterns. In contrast, the tilted and clustered BT templates in 3DD TGG-textured PNNZT ceramics led to collisions between epitaxially grown grains, resulting in comparatively lower f L values. The optimized microstructure of PNNZT ceramics textured via 2DD TGG resulted in exceptional piezoelectric properties, including high d 33 value of 1334 pC/N, k p value of 92.4%, g 33 value of 38.5 \xd7 10E^{\u22123} V\u2219m/N, and d 33\u2217 value of 1409 pm/V, all measured at a sintering temperature of 1000\xb0C. Compared to those of the untextured ceramics, the BT-templated PNNZT ceramics processed via both 3DD and 2DD TGG exhibited slightly reduced T m values of 146.4\xb0C and 146.6\xb0C. In P-E hysteresis analysis, the PNNZT ceramics textured by 2DD TGG demonstrated a higher P r value and lower E c value than those of their 3DD TGG counterparts. These factors contributed significantly to the enhanced d 33\u2217 values observed in the 2DD TGG ceramics. Moreover, the 2DD TGG-textured PNNZT ceramics exhibited excellent fatigue resistance, with only 6.5% degradation in d 33 E^{\u2217} after 10E^{6} cycles. Therefore, the 2DD TGG method represents a significant advance in the fabrication of high-performance piezoelectric ceramics, effectively overcoming the limitations of 3DD TGG and achieving superior microstructural, piezoelectric, and fatigue properties.

**Notes**:
- Write complete chemical formulas (e.g. '(Use the abbreviation key-value pair to track the abbreviations while extracting composition-property keywords). Don't use abbreviations, but you can use different environment if multiple compositions have different d33 values in different environments. For e.g.: 'LiNbO3-Air' and 'LiNbO3-Vacuum'.
- If multiple compositions are mentioned with different d33 values, extract all compositions mentioning different type/environment with a '-' and coreresponding d33 values.
- Mos of the formula are provided in ABSTRACT or INTRODUCTION or first part of EXPERIMENTAL SYNTHESIS.
- Use element symbols (e.g. 'K' not 'Potassium')
- For compositions with variables:
   * If multiple d33 values exist: Extract all compositions by substituting each variable value
   * If single d33 value: Extract only the best composition
- Prioritize data from tables
- Preserve proper chemical notation including:
   * Subscripts for atom counts
   * Parentheses for grouped elements
   * Proper fraction formatting
- Include the measurement unit for d33 values (usually pC/N or pm/V)
- Identify the broader family/class of materials - can be abbreviated forms
- Include if there is any doping in the composition using '+' sign with the composition, e.g. 'LiNbO3 + 2%wt Mg'
- Don't remove brackets or parentheses from the chemical formula which is already in the composition. Also, sometimes fractions are written before the composition (mostly in ()) for composition mixtures, don't remove them.
- Don't modify the abbreviation from referenced papers unless full composition is not available.
- ALWAYS follow the asked JSON format. DON'T write any extra information such as note points or explanations.
