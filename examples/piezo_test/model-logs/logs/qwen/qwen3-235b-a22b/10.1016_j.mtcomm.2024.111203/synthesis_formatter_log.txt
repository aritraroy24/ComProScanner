Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'solid-state reaction', 'precursors': [], 'steps': ['Raw materials prepared according to calculated ratios and ball-milled for 4 hours', 'Slurry dried at 100°C and calcined at 850°C for 2 hours', 'Dried slurry mixed with 7 wt.% polyvinyl alcohol binder and grounded', 'Powder pressed into 10 mm diameter discs and calcined at 1100°C for 2 hours'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'SEM', 'XPS', 'DC resistivity', 'LCR analyzer', 'd33 meter']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
