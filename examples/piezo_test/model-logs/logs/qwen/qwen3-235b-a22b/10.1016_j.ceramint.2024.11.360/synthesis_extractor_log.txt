A one-step molten salt route was used to synthesize the Bi4-x La x Ti3O12 samples ( (a)). Briefly, 6 mmol P25, 4-x mmol Bi2O3, x mmol La2O3, NaCl and KCl reagents were mixed and ground first (NaCl: KCl: Bi4-x La x Ti3O12 = 50: 50: 1; x = 0, 0.25, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75) and then calcined at 800 \xb0C for 2h in a muffle furnace. Finally, the samples collected after the calcined were washed several times with deionized water and dried in air at 80 \xb0C. The as-prepared samples were marked as BT, 0.25BLT, 0.75BLT, 1.0BLT, 1.25BLT, 1.5BLT, and 1.75BLT, respectively. As a comparison, the pure Bi4Ti3O12 was prepared by the solid-state method (without the addition of molten salt), noted as BT-ST.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was taken to obtain the crystallographic structure of BT-ST and Bi4-x La x Ti3O12 samples with different La contents. As shown in (b), the diffraction peaks at 10.75, 16.20, 23.33, 30.03, 32.84 and 33.11\xb0 are indexed to the orthorhombic Bi4Ti3O12 (JCPDS Card: 35\u20130795), and no peaks of other phases are observed in the BT-ST and BT, indicating that Bi4Ti3O12 powders with high purity are successfully synthesized by both solid-phase and molten salt methods. When 0.25\u2264x\u22641.0, xBLT has an orthorhombic crystal structure with diffraction peaks similar to those of pure BT. Moreover, it is found that the sharp diffraction peaks at (117) show a slight shift to the higher angles with increasing concentration of LaE^{3+} ((d)), meaning a shrinking cell volume. Based on Bragg's law (2dsin\u03b8=n\u03bb), the substitution of the smaller LaE^{3+}(1.06 \xc5) for the larger BiE^{3+}(1.08 \xc5) causes a decrease in the interplanar lattice constant d, leading to distorted lattice deformation. When 1.25\u2264x\u22641.75 in xBLT, a splitting of the strongest peak of the (171) crystal face near 2 \u03b8 = 30\xb0 implies that excessive La doping may lead to a transition of the crystal structure from orthorhombic to tetragonal. In addition, the distinct impurity peak is observed near 2 \u03b8 = 15\xb0. For these two reasons, xBLT (x = 1.25, 1.5, 1.75) will not be discussed in later parts. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was utilized to directly observe the samples\u2019 morphologies. The BT-ST sample consists mainly of irregular stacks of small particles with the longest edge of about 1 \u03bcm ( (a)), whereas the BT synthesized by the molten salt method is composed of well-defined sheets with a length of \u223c2 \u03bcm and a thickness of \u223c150 nm ((b)). Besides, with the addition of La content, the flake size and thickness of xBLT gradually decrease and many fragmented small grains are produced in (c) and , which is likely due to the introduction of La reduces the reaction rate of raw materials and impedes particle growth. During the reaction of primary materials, LaE^{3+} replacement of BiE^{3+} produces lattice distortion, which requires more energy for LaE^{3+} to enter the internal lattice of Bi4Ti3O12, causing a slower production of xBLT. The observed morphological differences between xBLT and BT-ST samples can be attributed to variations in synthetic conditions. However, in the molten salt process, the KCl and NaCl are in a molten state at the sintering temperature of 800 \xb0C. Due to the easy migration of the molten salt ions (KCl and NaCl) and the strong electrostatic force between the molten salt ions and the surface of the crystals of xBLT, the surface energy of some crystal faces of the xBLT crystal is high, along which xBLT crystals tend to grow, and thus promoting the formation of the sheet structures. Moreover, Bi4Ti3O12 has a layered structure formed by alternating stacks of pseudo perovskite layers (Bi2Ti3O10)E^{2-} and (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layers, which means that the bonding energy between the layers is relatively weak as the crystal grows, and the crystal is more likely to grow along a particular plane. As a result, the xBLT samples synthesized by the molten salt method are characterized by a regular nanosheet morphology. In addition, the EDS spectrum of 1.0BLT  show that all the peaks can be ascribed to Bi, La, Ti, and O elements. The molar ratio of them is estimated to be about 15.3 : 5.2 : 15.6 : 63.9, which is close to the theoretically calculated ratio. This result means that Bi3La1Ti3O12 powders are successfully synthesized by molten salt method. TEM was used to further characterize the microstructure characteristics of 1.0BLT. As shown in (d\u2013e), 1.0BLT nanosheets have a rectangular profile with an average edge length of about 1.7 \u03bcm, which is smaller than that of the BT nanosheets, in good agreement with the SEM results. The HRTEM images of BT and 1.0BLT nanosheets are shown in (f\u2013g). The periodic fringe spacing is 0.272 nm, corresponding to (200) lattice spacing of the orthorhombic Bi4Ti3O12 phase. From the EDS elemental mapping, it can be seen in (h) that the distribution of Ti, La, Bi and O displays uniform, implying LaE^{3+} ions have effectively replaced some of the BiE^{3+} ions within the Bi4Ti3O12 crystal lattice. XPS was employed to comprehensively investigate the elemental composition and chemical states of the BT and 1.0BLT samples, with the exception of a weak C 1s peak attributed to the influence of foreign hydrocarbons. As shown in (a), XPS survey spectra of BT and 1.0BLT reveal the presence of Bi, Ti, O signals in the BT sample and Bi, Ti, O and La signals in the 1.0BLT sample. The couple peaks of Bi 4f in 1.0BLT and pure BT at 159.05/158.95 eV and 164.35/164.25 eV are attributed to Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 ((b)), respectively, confirming the existence of BiE^{3+} species. For the Ti 2p spectra of 1.0BLT and BT, the lower binding energy peak (457.8/457.75 eV) is matched to Ti 2p3/2, while another peak is deconvoluted into two peaks at 466.15/466.1eV and 463.5/463.45eV ((c)), corresponding to Bi 4d3/2 and Ti 2p1/2. The energy difference between Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2, i.e. the peak spacing, is 5.7 eV, indicating the existence of +4 valence state of Ti. Each O 1s XPS peak can be decomposed into a Gaussian function, with the peaks centered at 529.5 eV(oxygen lattice, OL), 531.2 eV(oxygen vacancy, OV), and 532.6 eV(surface chemisorbed oxygen, OC) ((d))  Where, the ratio of the oxygen vacancies to the total oxygen in 1.0BLT is about 12.71 %, which is higher than 9.16 % in BT, indicating the oxygen vacancies are enhanced with La doping. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of La 3d is shown in (e), the diffraction peaks of La 3d5/2 and La 3d3/2, which are located at 833.7 eV, 837.9 eV and 850.45 eV, 854.8 eV, respectively, suggesting La element exists in the state of +3 valence in the sample. The piezo-, photo- and piezo-photocatalytic performance of the as-obtained samples for MO degradation were investigated under three different conditions: (1) ultrasonic vibration (piezocatalysis), (2) visible light irradiation (photocatalysis), and (3) co-excitation of ultrasonic and visible light (piezo-photocatalysis). As shown in (a\u2013b), only slight degradation of MO is observed without catalysts, which precludes the possibility of MO self-degradation under ultrasonic or light excitation. When exposed to ultrasonic vibration alone (dark), BT-ST, BT and xBLT samples all show different degrees of degradation ((a)), which demonstrates that ultrasonic can drive the catalysts to degrade organic pollutants. Moreover, the degradation efficiencies of MO reach 56.8 % for BT-ST within 120 min, but reach 70.8 %, 74.8 %, 81.4 % and 90.4 % for BT, 0.25BLT, 0.75BLT and 1.0BLT nanosheets, respectively. Catalytic process activity can be described by the apparent pseudo-first-order kinetic equation: ln(C/C0) = -kt. By linear fitting, the apparent rate constant (k) of 1.0BLT is 0.01871 minE^{\u22121}, which is about 1.9 and 2.68 times that of BT (0.00988 minE^{\u22121}) and BT-ST (0.007 minE^{\u22121}), respectively. Undoubtedly, the doping of La enlarges the structural distortion of Bi4Ti3O12, which significantly improves the piezoelectric catalytic performance under stress. The greater piezoelectricity of 1.0BLT may be responsible for the greater piezocatalytic activity of 1.0BLT. The high flexibility of 2D 1.0BLT nanosheets with thinner thickness allows them to deform more easily, making them more effective in the conversion of mechanical energy into piezoelectric potential. When exposed to sunlight alone, BT-ST exhibits poor photocatalytic performance, with only 34.6 % of MO degraded in 120 min whereas the degradation efficiencies of MO increase to 86.4 %, 88 %, 96.7 % and 98.2 % respectively for BT, 0.25BLT, 0.75BLT and 1.0BLT ((b)). This indicates that the molten salt method and doping La greatly improve the photocatalytic efficiency of the samples. 1.0BLT possesses the optimal k value of 0.0288minE^{\u22121}, which is about 8.28 and 1.75 times that of BT-ST (0.00348 minE^{\u22121}) and BT (0.0165 minE^{\u22121}), respectively. Quite intriguingly, when subjected to both ultrasonic vibrations and sunlight irradiation, the MO degradation activities of BT-ST, BT, 0.25BLT, 0.75BLT, and 1.0BLT reach 75.6 %, 85.8 %, 86.6 %, 97.8 %, and 100 % in 60 min ((c)), which is much greater than the degradation efficiency under single ultrasonic and single light conditions. For example, in 1.0BLT, the k-constant of piezoelectric photocatalysis is as high as 0.0705 minE^{\u22121}, which is 2.45 and 3.77 times higher than that of photocatalysis (0.0288 minE^{\u22121}) and piezoelectric catalysis (0.01871 minE^{\u22121}), respectively. Ultrasonic vibration induces the deformation of Bi4Ti3O12 piezoelectric material to generate a piezoelectric field (PF). The PF promotes the migration and separation of photogenerated carriers and inhibits photo-carrier aggregation, thus significantly enhancing photocatalytic activity. In addition, 1.0BLT has the highest piezo-photocatalytic activity compared with other xBLT and BT-ST, suggesting that the lamellar structure generated by the molten salt method and the appropriate amount of lanthanum doping promote MO degradation. clearly demonstrates 1.0BLT catalyst exhibits enhanced piezo-photocatalytic activity for the degradation of MO compared to a variety of other catalysts reported recently. The stability of 1.0BLT nanosheets was studied by comparing the photocatalytic activities of freshly prepared samples with those stored in air for 5 months. As shown in (h), the degradation rate of the sample after 5 months of storage reaches 94.7 % after 120 min irradiation, which is only slightly lower than that of the freshly prepared sample. This proves that 1.0BLT nanosheets have good storage stability. In addition, cyclic degradation experiments were also performed on 1.0BLT to test its reproducibility ((i)). It is found that the initial activity is maintained at 94.8 % after three cycles, which indicates that 1.0BLT exhibits excellent stability in photocatalytic degradation of contaminants. Furthermore, XRD pattern of 1.0BLT after these three reaction cycles shows that no additional phase is formed , indicating that 1.0BLT exhibits excellent stability and recyclability under light. Therefore, 1.0BLT nanosheets have good stability and can maintain a long service life during piezoelectric photocatalysis, improving the economy and practicality of piezoelectric photocatalysis technology. It is generally accepted that the degradation of organic pollutants is attributed to the action of reactive oxygen species (ROS). A series of free radical trapping experiments were employed to investigate the role of different ROS in the piezoelectric photocatalytic degradation of 1.0BLT. In the experiments, methanol (MT), isopropanol (IPA), and p-benzoquinone (BQ) were used to capture hE^{+}, \xb7OH and \xb7O2 E^{\u2212}, respectively. The piezo-photocatalytic degradation efficiencies of MO by 1.0BLT decrease to 86 % and 66 % after the addition of MT and IPA ( (a)), respectively, indicating the negligible contribution of hE^{+} and limited participation of \xb7OH. When BQ is introduced into the reaction system, its inhibitory effect on the process is significantly observed, resulting in only 16 % of MO being effectively degraded, clearly indicating the central role of \xb7O2 E^{\u2212} in the removal of MO by piezoelectric photocatalytic technology. To gain further insight into the role of \xb7OH and \xb7O2 E^{\u2212} radicals in different catalytic modes, we employed 5,5 dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) as a spin-trapping agent and performed ESR tests. The absence of DMPO-\xb7OH (1:2:2:1) peak in (b) under ultrasonic stimulation indicates that ultrasound fails to produce \xb7OH. However, a very weak DMPO-\xb7OH (1:2:2:1) signal can be seen under light irradiation alone. This signal is greatly amplified under light and ultrasonic co-excitation, indicating that \xb7OH is involved in the degradation of MO under piezo-photocatalytic condition. An increased number of photogenerated hE^{+} migrate to the surface to generate more \xb7OH in the action of a piezoelectric electric field. However, as shown in (c), clear DMPO-\xb7O2 E^{\u2212} (1:1:1:1) signals are detected after 5 min of light irradiation, ultrasonic excitation and light and ultrasonic co-excitation. The order of peak intensities of DMPO-\xb7O2 E^{\u2212} (1:1:1:1) is as follows: piezo-photocatalysis > photocatalysis > piezocatalysis ((c)), which is consistent with the degradation experiments. In addition, it can be seen from (b) and (c) that the peak intensities of DMPO-\xb7O2 E^{\u2212} are much higher than those of DMPO-\xb7OH. All the results indicate that \xb7O2 E^{\u2212}has a crucial role in the catalytic process. The mechanism of enhanced photocatalytic, piezoelectric and piezo-photocatalytic properties of La-doped Bi4Ti3O12 will be further discussed below. The optical properties of the samples were investigated by UV\u2013Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. As shown in (a) and , the absorption edges of BT-ST, BT, 0.25BLT, 0.75BLT and 1.0BLT are about 396, 404, 397, 388 and 386 nm, respectively. It is noteworthy that the absorption edges of xBLT are shifted to lower wavelengths compared to pure BT, indicating that the doped samples are less utilized in the full spectrum of light, which theoretically leads to a decrease in photocatalytic performance. The band gap of the catalyst is estimated using the Kubelka-Monk formula : \u03b1hv=A(hv\uff0d Eg) E^{ }. The band gaps of BT-ST, BT, 0.25BLT, 0.75BLT, and 1.0BLT are about 3.02, 2.96, 3, 3.04 and 3.06 eV, respectively ((a) and ). As the amount of La doping increases, the bandgaps of xBLT become wider, possibly due to quantum domain-limiting effects triggered by the decrease in nanosheet size. As shown in (b), BT-ST, BT and 1.0BLT are all positive-slope n-type semiconductors at 20 kHz , and their flat band potential (EFB) are \u22120.193 eV, \u22120.623 eV and \u22120.663 eV vs. NHE (the normal hydrogen electrode) according to the equation E ( NHE)=E ( Ag/AgCl)+0.197. It is generally accepted that the EFB is 0.3 eV more positive than the conduction band potential (ECB) for most n-type semiconductors , so the ECB of BT-ST, BT, and 1.0BLT vs. NHE is calculated to be \u22120.493, \u22120.923, and \u22120.963 eV, respectively. The valence band potentials (EVB) of the three are further obtained to be 2.527, 2.037, and 2.097 eV according to formula E VB\u2212 E CB= Eg. The energy band diagrams of BT-ST, BT and 1.0BLT are shown in. The EVB of 1.0BLT is more positive than the oxidation potential of OHE^{\u2212}/\xb7OH (1.9 eV), while the ECB is more negative than the reduction potential of O2/\xb7O2 E^{\u2212} (\u22120.33 eV). From a thermodynamic point of view, this potential relationship favors the oxidation of OHE^{\u2212} to \xb7OH and the reduction of O2 to \xb7O2 E^{\u2212}, a finding in agreement with free radicals scavenging experiments. Furthermore, the more positive EVB and more negative ECB of 1.0BLT in comparison to BT suggest that the photogenerated holes and electrons exhibit augmented redox capacity, thereby facilitating more effective degradation of the target pollutants. Further research is needed to investigate the factors that improve the properties of xBLT after doping with La. As shown in (c), and , SA of BT-ST, BT, 0.25BLT, 0.75BLT, and 1.0BLT are 1.0025 mE^{2}\u22c5gE^{\u22121}, 2.7705 mE^{2}\u22c5gE^{\u22121}, 4.5537 mE^{2}\u22c5gE^{\u22121}, 6.72 mE^{2}\u22c5gE^{\u22121}, and 6.932 mE^{2}\u22c5gE^{\u22121}. The larger specific surface area of BT compared to BT-ST is attributed to the effect of high-temperature molten salt, which refines the particles and produces a lamellar structure with regular morphology, less prone to agglomeration, and good dispersion. As shown in and , with the addition of La content, the flake size and thickness of xBLT gradually decrease and many fragmented small grains are produced. So, the specific surface area of xBLT gradually increases with increasing La doping. In addition, the gradually increasing specific surface area with increasing lanthanum doping is consistent with the trend of piezoelectric photocatalytic degradation of MO. The increased specific surface areas imply that xBLT has more active sites and can adsorb more MO on the catalyst surface, thus promoting the further occurrence of the catalytic reaction. The separation and transport properties of photo-generated carriers was evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), photocurrent and PL spectra. The order of the arc radius size of the samples is BT-ST > BT > 0.25BLT >0.75BLT >1.0BLT ((d) and ), meaning that 1.0BLT has the fastest charge transfer rate. Under light irradiation, 1.0BLT owns the highest photocurrent density, which is about 1.64 times that of BT and 2.64 times that of BT-ST, indicating that 1.0BLT has a higher separation efficiency of carriers and a lower electron-hole pairs complexation rate. PL response originates from the complexation of photogenerated carriers. Under optical excitation at 310 nm, the PL emission peaks of BT-ST, BT, and xBLT are concentrated in the region of about 400 nm, indicating that the doping of La element does not significantly affect the location of the emission peaks ((f) and ). Compared with BT-ST, the PL intensities of BT and xBLT are reduced, especially the lowest intensity of 1.0BLT. This indicates that the complexation of photogenerated carriers in the BT prepared by the molten salt method is slow and the complexation is suppressed to a greater extent after doping La, which leads to the participation of more carriers in the reaction and improves the catalytic efficiency of xBLT. The consistent results of PL, photocurrent, EIS and BET tests indicated that the improved photocatalytic performance of 1.0BLT is mainly due to the decrease in carrier complexation rate and increase in specific surface area. To investigate the relationship between piezoelectric catalytic efficiency and mechanical force strength, the effect of ultrasonic power on the degradation performance of 1.0BLT was investigated. It can be observed from (a) that the degradation efficiency of 1.0BLT on MO increases with the gradual increase of ultrasonic power. In addition, the piezoelectric catalyzed reduction of Au\xb3\u207a to Au\u2070 was used to verify the piezocatalytic property of 1.0BLT. The high-resolution Au 4f spectrum of Au/1.0BLT sample shows two characteristic peaks at 88.1 eV and 84.2 eV, which are corresponding to the 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 of Au\u2070, respectively ((b)). The presence of a Au\u2070 peak demonstrates that AuE^{3+} ions are effectively reduced to metallic Au during the piezoelectric catalytic process. The above results confirm that ultrasonic excitation can induce piezo-catalytic behavior in the 1.0BLT. The ultrasonic vibrations cause 1.0BLT nanosheets to bend due to the pressure exerted by cavitation bubbles, resulting in the accumulation of positive and negative charges on opposite surfaces of the crystal and forming a piezoelectric field. The internal electric field drives the separation and migration of charge carriers to the surface, where redox reactions occur, resulting in the reduction of Au\xb3\u207a ions to metallic Au, or the degradation of MO in water. The piezoelectric properties of BT-ST, BT and 1.0BLT samples were further characterized by PFM. The polarization transition behavior and local piezoelectric response of BT-ST and BT and 1.0BLT were investigated by applying a biased electric field of \xb110 V. As shown in (d\u2013f), all samples have 180\xb0 phase change hysteresis loops and typical amplitude-voltage butterfly loops, further confirming the presence of 180\xb0 domains and a pronounced ferroelectric response in BT-ST, BT, and 1.0BLT. Moreover, the butterfly amplitude curves reveal that BT-ST and BT and 1.0BLT exhibit maximum electrically induced displacements of approximately 42 pm, 81 pm and 127 pm, respectively, demonstrating the superior piezoelectric properties of 1.0BLT compared to BT-ST and BT. This is due to the fact that the 2D thinner 1.0BLT nanosheets are much more flexible than the BT sheets and 3D BT-ST irregular particles, resulting in a larger amplitude and stronger piezoelectric response of 1.0BLT under the same stress. Simultaneously, the phase angle of three samples changes from 145\xb0 to \u221235\xb0 when exposed to the \u221210 V DC bias field. This means that the BT-ST and BT and 1.0BLT catalysts have non-zero residual polarization and ferroelectric properties, as well as the ability to switch polarization with the change of electric field direction. Especially, based on formula S1(Supporting information), the piezoelectric coefficient (d33) of 1.0BLT (11.57 pm/V) is approximately 1.49 times that of BT (7.75 pm/V) and 2.72 times that of BT-ST (4.25 pm/V) ((c)). All results show that the piezoelectric potentials follow the pattern 1.0BLT > BT > BT-ST, which is consistent with the previous trend of catalytic degradation of MO. In order to theoretically investigate the relationship between the geometry and size of the materials and their piezoelectric catalytic performance, the finite element method (FEM) of COMSOL was used to simulate the piezo-response of BT-ST, BT, and 1.0BLT. Based on the TEM and SEM images, BT-ST was assumed to be a sphere with a radius of 0.5 \u03bcm, and BT and 1.0BLT were nanosheets with length \xd7 width \xd7 height of 2 \xd7 2 \xd7 0.15 \u03bcm and 1.7 \xd7 1.7 \xd7 0.1 \u03bcm, respectively. The material parameters of BLT are derived from the article reported by Zhong et al. (Text S5). In the simulation experiment shown in (g\u2013i), When subjected to a stress of 10E^{7} Pa, the maximum piezoelectric potential of the BT-ST is significantly lower than that of the BT, whereas the 1.0BLT outperforms the former two, presenting the highest piezoelectric response activity. This finding is highly consistent with the PFM as well as the catalytic results, further confirming the superiority of 1.0BLT in piezoelectric performance. Compared with the conventional spherical structures, the BT and 1.0BLT nanosheet structures prepared by the molten salt method are able to exhibit a more significant lattice deformation effect when subjected to the same compressive stress. In addition, compared to BT, the 1.0BLT nanosheets with the thinner thick and larger aspect ratio(length/thickness) have an increased sensitivity to external stress, which result in a larger piezoelectric potential, making it easier to efficiently separate photogenerated carriers. A possible mechanism of the piezo-photocatalytic process for 1.0BLT nanosheets was postulated. In a photocatalytic process, photo-generated electron-hole pairs are produced in 1.0BLT nanosheets under light irradiation. As the ECB potential of the 1.0BLT catalyst is more negative than the O2/\xb7O2 E^{\u2212} potential , the photo-generated electrons can reduce O2 to produce \xb7O2 E^{\u2212}. At the same time, the EVB potential of 1.0BLT is greater than the OHE^{\u2212}/\u22c5OH potential, which allows for the production of \u22c5OH and the oxidation of organic contaminants. However, these photo-generated carriers tend to recombine rapidly, which weakens the photocatalytic activity of 1.0BLT. Under ultrasonic excitation, the 1.0BLT nanosheets are deformed by the pressure of the cavitation bubbles, resulting in a piezoelectric effect that generates an internal piezoelectric electric field. The slanted VB will effectively attract holes, oxidizing H2O to produce \u22c5OH. Similarly, a tilted CB will accumulate electrons, reducing O2 to produce \xb7O2 E^{\u2212}. However, the piezocatalytic activity of the 1.0BLT nanosheets is weak owing to the relatively low concentration of ultrasonically excited free charges. (a\u2013b) demonstrates the schematic of charge separation and energy band structure changes of 1.0BLT under piezo-photocatalysis. With the combined action of light and ultrasound, light excites 1.0BLT to produce photogenerated carriers, while ultrasonic leads to the generation of positively polarized charges (q+) and negatively polarized charges (q-) on the opposing surfaces of 1.0BLT, resulting in the formation of a built-in piezoelectric field ((a), Eq. ). The PF can induce energy band tilt by changing the onset potential of the current density, in other words, the internal piezoelectric field can modulate the energy band. The photogenerated electrons react with the adsorbed oxygen on the surface of the catalyst to generate \xb7O2 E^{\u2212} (Eq. ), while the photogenerated holes can react with water molecules or surface-adsorbed hydroxide ions to generate \u22c5OH (Eq. ). Active species, including \xb7O2 E^{\u2212} and \u22c5OH, collaborate to degrade organic pollutants into inorganic or small molecule substances through a series of oxidation reactions (Eq. ). In short, driven by the piezoelectric potential, the photogenerated electron-hole pairs are rapidly separated and migrate to the surface to undergo redox reactions, greatly improving the photocatalytic activity of 1.0BLT, called piezoelectric enhanced photocatalysis. Based on the above experimental results, the factors responsible for the enhanced catalytic activity of 1.0BLT can be deduced. Firstly, compared with the undoped BT, the energy band structure of 1.0BLT is optimized, which exhibits a more positive valence band potential and a more negative conduction band potential. Secondly, LaE^{3+} partially replaces BiE^{3+} in the structure of Bi4Ti3O12, resulting in the distortion and deformation of the lattice, which significantly improves the piezoelectric catalytic performance of 1.0BLT. Further, the thinner sheet structure of 1.0BLT is also one of the key factors. Compared with the spherical structure of BT-ST prepared by the solid-phase method and the lamellar structure of BT prepared by the molten salt method, 1.0BLT exhibits a much thinner nanosheet morphology. This structural optimization significantly enhances the charge transfer efficiency, resulting in a substantial increase in the charge utilization efficiency of 1.0BLT in the catalytic process. In summary, the significant enhancement of the piezoelectric photocatalytic activity of 1.0BLT is the result of the synergistic effect of its optimized energy band structure, the advantages of the thinner lamellar structure, and the enhanced piezoelectric response, among other factors. The final cumulative effect of all aspects leads to the excellent catalytic performance of 1.0BLT in the field of piezoelectric photocatalytic degradation of pollutants.

A one-step molten salt route was used to synthesize the Bi4-x La x Ti3O12 samples ( (a)). Briefly, 6 mmol P25, 4-x mmol Bi2O3, x mmol La2O3, NaCl and KCl reagents were mixed and ground first (NaCl: KCl: Bi4-x La x Ti3O12 = 50: 50: 1; x = 0, 0.25, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75) and then calcined at 800 \xb0C for 2h in a muffle furnace. Finally, the samples collected after the calcined were washed several times with deionized water and dried in air at 80 \xb0C. The as-prepared samples were marked as BT, 0.25BLT, 0.75BLT, 1.0BLT, 1.25BLT, 1.5BLT, and 1.75BLT, respectively. As a comparison, the pure Bi4Ti3O12 was prepared by the solid-state method (without the addition of molten salt), noted as BT-ST.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was taken to obtain the crystallographic structure of BT-ST and Bi4-x La x Ti3O12 samples with different La contents. As shown in (b), the diffraction peaks at 10.75, 16.20, 23.33, 30.03, 32.84 and 33.11\xb0 are indexed to the orthorhombic Bi4Ti3O12 (JCPDS Card: 35\u20130795), and no peaks of other phases are observed in the BT-ST and BT, indicating that Bi4Ti3O12 powders with high purity are successfully synthesized by both solid-phase and molten salt methods. When 0.25\u2264x\u22641.0, xBLT has an orthorhombic crystal structure with diffraction peaks similar to those of pure BT. Moreover, it is found that the sharp diffraction peaks at (117) show a slight shift to the higher angles with increasing concentration of LaE^{3+} ((d)), meaning a shrinking cell volume. Based on Bragg's law (2dsin\u03b8=n\u03bb), the substitution of the smaller LaE^{3+}(1.06 \xc5) for the larger BiE^{3+}(1.08 \xc5) causes a decrease in the interplanar lattice constant d, leading to distorted lattice deformation. When 1.25\u2264x\u22641.75 in xBLT, a splitting of the strongest peak of the (171) crystal face near 2 \u03b8 = 30\xb0 implies that excessive La doping may lead to a transition of the crystal structure from orthorhombic to tetragonal. In addition, the distinct impurity peak is observed near 2 \u03b8 = 15\xb0. For these two reasons, xBLT (x = 1.25, 1.5, 1.75) will not be discussed in later parts. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was utilized to directly observe the samples\u2019 morphologies. The BT-ST sample consists mainly of irregular stacks of small particles with the longest edge of about 1 \u03bcm ( (a)), whereas the BT synthesized by the molten salt method is composed of well-defined sheets with a length of \u223c2 \u03bcm and a thickness of \u223c150 nm ((b)). Besides, with the addition of La content, the flake size and thickness of xBLT gradually decrease and many fragmented small grains are produced in (c) and , which is likely due to the introduction of La reduces the reaction rate of raw materials and impedes particle growth. During the reaction of primary materials, LaE^{3+} replacement of BiE^{3+} produces lattice distortion, which requires more energy for LaE^{3+} to enter the internal lattice of Bi4Ti3O12, causing a slower production of xBLT. The observed morphological differences between xBLT and BT-ST samples can be attributed to variations in synthetic conditions. However, in the molten salt process, the KCl and NaCl are in a molten state at the sintering temperature of 800 \xb0C. Due to the easy migration of the molten salt ions (KCl and NaCl) and the strong electrostatic force between the molten salt ions and the surface of the crystals of xBLT, the surface energy of some crystal faces of the xBLT crystal is high, along which xBLT crystals tend to grow, and thus promoting the formation of the sheet structures. Moreover, Bi4Ti3O12 has a layered structure formed by alternating stacks of pseudo perovskite layers (Bi2Ti3O10)E^{2-} and (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layers, which means that the bonding energy between the layers is relatively weak as the crystal grows, and the crystal is more likely to grow along a particular plane. As a result, the xBLT samples synthesized by the molten salt method are characterized by a regular nanosheet morphology. In addition, the EDS spectrum of 1.0BLT  show that all the peaks can be ascribed to Bi, La, Ti, and O elements. The molar ratio of them is estimated to be about 15.3 : 5.2 : 15.6 : 63.9, which is close to the theoretically calculated ratio. This result means that Bi3La1Ti3O12 powders are successfully synthesized by molten salt method. TEM was used to further characterize the microstructure characteristics of 1.0BLT. As shown in (d\u2013e), 1.0BLT nanosheets have a rectangular profile with an average edge length of about 1.7 \u03bcm, which is smaller than that of the BT nanosheets, in good agreement with the SEM results. The HRTEM images of BT and 1.0BLT nanosheets are shown in (f\u2013g). The periodic fringe spacing is 0.272 nm, corresponding to (200) lattice spacing of the orthorhombic Bi4Ti3O12 phase. From the EDS elemental mapping, it can be seen in (h) that the distribution of Ti, La, Bi and O displays uniform, implying LaE^{3+} ions have effectively replaced some of the BiE^{3+} ions within the Bi4Ti3O12 crystal lattice. XPS was employed to comprehensively investigate the elemental composition and chemical states of the BT and 1.0BLT samples, with the exception of a weak C 1s peak attributed to the influence of foreign hydrocarbons. As shown in (a), XPS survey spectra of BT and 1.0BLT reveal the presence of Bi, Ti, O signals in the BT sample and Bi, Ti, O and La signals in the 1.0BLT sample. The couple peaks of Bi 4f in 1.0BLT and pure BT at 159.05/158.95 eV and 164.35/164.25 eV are attributed to Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 ((b)), respectively, confirming the existence of BiE^{3+} species. For the Ti 2p spectra of 1.0BLT and BT, the lower binding energy peak (457.8/457.75 eV) is matched to Ti 2p3/2, while another peak is deconvoluted into two peaks at 466.15/466.1eV and 463.5/463.45eV ((c)), corresponding to Bi 4d3/2 and Ti 2p1/2. The energy difference between Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2, i.e. the peak spacing, is 5.7 eV, indicating the existence of +4 valence state of Ti. Each O 1s XPS peak can be decomposed into a Gaussian function, with the peaks centered at 529.5 eV(oxygen lattice, OL), 531.2 eV(oxygen vacancy, OV), and 532.6 eV(surface chemisorbed oxygen, OC) ((d))  Where, the ratio of the oxygen vacancies to the total oxygen in 1.0BLT is about 12.71 %, which is higher than 9.16 % in BT, indicating the oxygen vacancies are enhanced with La doping. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of La 3d is shown in (e), the diffraction peaks of La 3d5/2 and La 3d3/2, which are located at 833.7 eV, 837.9 eV and 850.45 eV, 854.8 eV, respectively, suggesting La element exists in the state of +3 valence in the sample. The piezo-, photo- and piezo-photocatalytic performance of the as-obtained samples for MO degradation were investigated under three different conditions: (1) ultrasonic vibration (piezocatalysis), (2) visible light irradiation (photocatalysis), and (3) co-excitation of ultrasonic and visible light (piezo-photocatalysis). As shown in (a\u2013b), only slight degradation of MO is observed without catalysts, which precludes the possibility of MO self-degradation under ultrasonic or light excitation. When exposed to ultrasonic vibration alone (dark), BT-ST, BT and xBLT samples all show different degrees of degradation ((a)), which demonstrates that ultrasonic can drive the catalysts to degrade organic pollutants. Moreover, the degradation efficiencies of MO reach 56.8 % for BT-ST within 120 min, but reach 70.8 %, 74.8 %, 81.4 % and 90.4 % for BT, 0.25BLT, 0.75BLT and 1.0BLT nanosheets, respectively. Catalytic process activity can be described by the apparent pseudo-first-order kinetic equation: ln(C/C0) = -kt. By linear fitting, the apparent rate constant (k) of 1.0BLT is 0.01871 minE^{\u22121}, which is about 1.9 and 2.68 times that of BT (0.00988 minE^{\u22121}) and BT-ST (0.007 minE^{\u22121}), respectively. Undoubtedly, the doping of La enlarges the structural distortion of Bi4Ti3O12, which significantly improves the piezoelectric catalytic performance under stress. The greater piezoelectricity of 1.0BLT may be responsible for the greater piezocatalytic activity of 1.0BLT. The high flexibility of 2D 1.0BLT nanosheets with thinner thickness allows them to deform more easily, making them more effective in the conversion of mechanical energy into piezoelectric potential. When exposed to sunlight alone, BT-ST exhibits poor photocatalytic performance, with only 34.6 % of MO degraded in 120 min whereas the degradation efficiencies of MO increase to 86.4 %, 88 %, 96.7 % and 98.2 % respectively for BT, 0.25BLT, 0.75BLT and 1.0BLT ((b)). This indicates that the molten salt method and doping La greatly improve the photocatalytic efficiency of the samples. 1.0BLT possesses the optimal k value of 0.0288minE^{\u22121}, which is about 8.28 and 1.75 times that of BT-ST (0.00348 minE^{\u22121}) and BT (0.0165 minE^{\u22121}), respectively. Quite intriguingly, when subjected to both ultrasonic vibrations and sunlight irradiation, the MO degradation activities of BT-ST, BT, 0.25BLT, 0.75BLT, and 1.0BLT reach 75.6 %, 85.8 %, 86.6 %, 97.8 %, and 100 % in 60 min ((c)), which is much greater than the degradation efficiency under single ultrasonic and single light conditions. For example, in 1.0BLT, the k-constant of piezoelectric photocatalysis is as high as 0.0705 minE^{\u22121}, which is 2.45 and 3.77 times higher than that of photocatalysis (0.0288 minE^{\u22121}) and piezoelectric catalysis (0.01871 minE^{\u22121}), respectively. Ultrasonic vibration induces the deformation of Bi4Ti3O12 piezoelectric material to generate a piezoelectric field (PF). The PF promotes the migration and separation of photogenerated carriers and inhibits photo-carrier aggregation, thus significantly enhancing photocatalytic activity. In addition, 1.0BLT has the highest piezo-photocatalytic activity compared with other xBLT and BT-ST, suggesting that the lamellar structure generated by the molten salt method and the appropriate amount of lanthanum doping promote MO degradation. clearly demonstrates 1.0BLT catalyst exhibits enhanced piezo-photocatalytic activity for the degradation of MO compared to a variety of other catalysts reported recently. The stability of 1.0BLT nanosheets was studied by comparing the photocatalytic activities of freshly prepared samples with those stored in air for 5 months. As shown in (h), the degradation rate of the sample after 5 months of storage reaches 94.7 % after 120 min irradiation, which is only slightly lower than that of the freshly prepared sample. This proves that 1.0BLT nanosheets have good storage stability. In addition, cyclic degradation experiments were also performed on 1.0BLT to test its reproducibility ((i)). It is found that the initial activity is maintained at 94.8 % after three cycles, which indicates that 1.0BLT exhibits excellent stability in photocatalytic degradation of contaminants. Furthermore, XRD pattern of 1.0BLT after these three reaction cycles shows that no additional phase is formed , indicating that 1.0BLT exhibits excellent stability and recyclability under light. Therefore, 1.0BLT nanosheets have good stability and can maintain a long service life during piezoelectric photocatalysis, improving the economy and practicality of piezoelectric photocatalysis technology. It is generally accepted that the degradation of organic pollutants is attributed to the action of reactive oxygen species (ROS). A series of free radical trapping experiments were employed to investigate the role of different ROS in the piezoelectric photocatalytic degradation of 1.0BLT. In the experiments, methanol (MT), isopropanol (IPA), and p-benzoquinone (BQ) were used to capture hE^{+}, \xb7OH and \xb7O2 E^{\u2212}, respectively. The piezo-photocatalytic degradation efficiencies of MO by 1.0BLT decrease to 86 % and 66 % after the addition of MT and IPA ( (a)), respectively, indicating the negligible contribution of hE^{+} and limited participation of \xb7OH. When BQ is introduced into the reaction system, its inhibitory effect on the process is significantly observed, resulting in only 16 % of MO being effectively degraded, clearly indicating the central role of \xb7O2 E^{\u2212} in the removal of MO by piezoelectric photocatalytic technology. To gain further insight into the role of \xb7OH and \xb7O2 E^{\u2212} radicals in different catalytic modes, we employed 5,5 dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) as a spin-trapping agent and performed ESR tests. The absence of DMPO-\xb7OH (1:2:2:1) peak in (b) under ultrasonic stimulation indicates that ultrasound fails to produce \xb7OH. However, a very weak DMPO-\xb7OH (1:2:2:1) signal can be seen under light irradiation alone. This signal is greatly amplified under light and ultrasonic co-excitation, indicating that \xb7OH is involved in the degradation of MO under piezo-photocatalytic condition. An increased number of photogenerated hE^{+} migrate to the surface to generate more \xb7OH in the action of a piezoelectric electric field. However, as shown in (c), clear DMPO-\xb7O2 E^{\u2212} (1:1:1:1) signals are detected after 5 min of light irradiation, ultrasonic excitation and light and ultrasonic co-excitation. The order of peak intensities of DMPO-\xb7O2 E^{\u2212} (1:1:1:1) is as follows: piezo-photocatalysis > photocatalysis > piezocatalysis ((c)), which is consistent with the degradation experiments. In addition, it can be seen from (b) and (c) that the peak intensities of DMPO-\xb7O2 E^{\u2212} are much higher than those of DMPO-\xb7OH. All the results indicate that \xb7O2 E^{\u2212}has a crucial role in the catalytic process. The mechanism of enhanced photocatalytic, piezoelectric and piezo-photocatalytic properties of La-doped Bi4Ti3O12 will be further discussed below. The optical properties of the samples were investigated by UV\u2013Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. As shown in (a) and , the absorption edges of BT-ST, BT, 0.25BLT, 0.75BLT and 1.0BLT are about 396, 404, 397, 388 and 386 nm, respectively. It is noteworthy that the absorption edges of xBLT are shifted to lower wavelengths compared to pure BT, indicating that the doped samples are less utilized in the full spectrum of light, which theoretically leads to a decrease in photocatalytic performance. The band gap of the catalyst is estimated using the Kubelka-Monk formula : \u03b1hv=A(hv\uff0d Eg) E^{ }. The band gaps of BT-ST, BT, 0.25BLT, 0.75BLT, and 1.0BLT are about 3.02, 2.96, 3, 3.04 and 3.06 eV, respectively ((a) and ). As the amount of La doping increases, the bandgaps of xBLT become wider, possibly due to quantum domain-limiting effects triggered by the decrease in nanosheet size. As shown in (b), BT-ST, BT and 1.0BLT are all positive-slope n-type semiconductors at 20 kHz , and their flat band potential (EFB) are \u22120.193 eV, \u22120.623 eV and \u22120.663 eV vs. NHE (the normal hydrogen electrode) according to the equation E ( NHE)=E ( Ag/AgCl)+0.197. It is generally accepted that the EFB is 0.3 eV more positive than the conduction band potential (ECB) for most n-type semiconductors , so the ECB of BT-ST, BT, and 1.0BLT vs. NHE is calculated to be \u22120.493, \u22120.923, and \u22120.963 eV, respectively. The valence band potentials (EVB) of the three are further obtained to be 2.527, 2.037, and 2.097 eV according to formula E VB\u2212 E CB= Eg. The energy band diagrams of BT-ST, BT and 1.0BLT are shown in. The EVB of 1.0BLT is more positive than the oxidation potential of OHE^{\u2212}/\xb7OH (1.9 eV), while the ECB is more negative than the reduction potential of O2/\xb7O2 E^{\u2212} (\u22120.33 eV). From a thermodynamic point of view, this potential relationship favors the oxidation of OHE^{\u2212} to \xb7OH and the reduction of O2 to \xb7O2 E^{\u2212}, a finding in agreement with free radicals scavenging experiments. Furthermore, the more positive EVB and more negative ECB of 1.0BLT in comparison to BT suggest that the photogenerated holes and electrons exhibit augmented redox capacity, thereby facilitating more effective degradation of the target pollutants. Further research is needed to investigate the factors that improve the properties of xBLT after doping with La. As shown in (c), and , SA of BT-ST, BT, 0.25BLT, 0.75BLT, and 1.0BLT are 1.0025 mE^{2}\u22c5gE^{\u22121}, 2.7705 mE^{2}\u22c5gE^{\u22121}, 4.5537 mE^{2}\u22c5gE^{\u22121}, 6.72 mE^{2}\u22c5gE^{\u22121}, and 6.932 mE^{2}\u22c5gE^{\u22121}. The larger specific surface area of BT compared to BT-ST is attributed to the effect of high-temperature molten salt, which refines the particles and produces a lamellar structure with regular morphology, less prone to agglomeration, and good dispersion. As shown in and , with the addition of La content, the flake size and thickness of xBLT gradually decrease and many fragmented small grains are produced. So, the specific surface area of xBLT gradually increases with increasing La doping. In addition, the gradually increasing specific surface area with increasing lanthanum doping is consistent with the trend of piezoelectric photocatalytic degradation of MO. The increased specific surface areas imply that xBLT has more active sites and can adsorb more MO on the catalyst surface, thus promoting the further occurrence of the catalytic reaction. The separation and transport properties of photo-generated carriers was evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), photocurrent and PL spectra. The order of the arc radius size of the samples is BT-ST > BT > 0.25BLT >0.75BLT >1.0BLT ((d) and ), meaning that 1.0BLT has the fastest charge transfer rate. Under light irradiation, 1.0BLT owns the highest photocurrent density, which is about 1.64 times that of BT and 2.64 times that of BT-ST, indicating that 1.0BLT has a higher separation efficiency of carriers and a lower electron-hole pairs complexation rate. PL response originates from the complexation of photogenerated carriers. Under optical excitation at 310 nm, the PL emission peaks of BT-ST, BT, and xBLT are concentrated in the region of about 400 nm, indicating that the doping of La element does not significantly affect the location of the emission peaks ((f) and ). Compared with BT-ST, the PL intensities of BT and xBLT are reduced, especially the lowest intensity of 1.0BLT. This indicates that the complexation of photogenerated carriers in the BT prepared by the molten salt method is slow and the complexation is suppressed to a greater extent after doping La, which leads to the participation of more carriers in the reaction and improves the catalytic efficiency of xBLT. The consistent results of PL, photocurrent, EIS and BET tests indicated that the improved photocatalytic performance of 1.0BLT is mainly due to the decrease in carrier complexation rate and increase in specific surface area. To investigate the relationship between piezoelectric catalytic efficiency and mechanical force strength, the effect of ultrasonic power on the degradation performance of 1.0BLT was investigated. It can be observed from (a) that the degradation efficiency of 1.0BLT on MO increases with the gradual increase of ultrasonic power. In addition, the piezoelectric catalyzed reduction of Au\xb3\u207a to Au\u2070 was used to verify the piezocatalytic property of 1.0BLT. The high-resolution Au 4f spectrum of Au/1.0BLT sample shows two characteristic peaks at 88.1 eV and 84.2 eV, which are corresponding to the 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 of Au\u2070, respectively ((b)). The presence of a Au\u2070 peak demonstrates that AuE^{3+} ions are effectively reduced to metallic Au during the piezoelectric catalytic process. The above results confirm that ultrasonic excitation can induce piezo-catalytic behavior in the 1.0BLT. The ultrasonic vibrations cause 1.0BLT nanosheets to bend due to the pressure exerted by cavitation bubbles, resulting in the accumulation of positive and negative charges on opposite surfaces of the crystal and forming a piezoelectric field. The internal electric field drives the separation and migration of charge carriers to the surface, where redox reactions occur, resulting in the reduction of Au\xb3\u207a ions to metallic Au, or the degradation of MO in water. The piezoelectric properties of BT-ST, BT and 1.0BLT samples were further characterized by PFM. The polarization transition behavior and local piezoelectric response of BT-ST and BT and 1.0BLT were investigated by applying a biased electric field of \xb110 V. As shown in (d\u2013f), all samples have 180\xb0 phase change hysteresis loops and typical amplitude-voltage butterfly loops, further confirming the presence of 180\xb0 domains and a pronounced ferroelectric response in BT-ST, BT, and 1.0BLT. Moreover, the butterfly amplitude curves reveal that BT-ST and BT and 1.0BLT exhibit maximum electrically induced displacements of approximately 42 pm, 81 pm and 127 pm, respectively, demonstrating the superior piezoelectric properties of 1.0BLT compared to BT-ST and BT. This is due to the fact that the 2D thinner 1.0BLT nanosheets are much more flexible than the BT sheets and 3D BT-ST irregular particles, resulting in a larger amplitude and stronger piezoelectric response of 1.0BLT under the same stress. Simultaneously, the phase angle of three samples changes from 145\xb0 to \u221235\xb0 when exposed to the \u221210 V DC bias field. This means that the BT-ST and BT and 1.0BLT catalysts have non-zero residual polarization and ferroelectric properties, as well as the ability to switch polarization with the change of electric field direction. Especially, based on formula S1(Supporting information), the piezoelectric coefficient (d33) of 1.0BLT (11.57 pm/V) is approximately 1.49 times that of BT (7.75 pm/V) and 2.72 times that of BT-ST (4.25 pm/V) ((c)). All results show that the piezoelectric potentials follow the pattern 1.0BLT > BT > BT-ST, which is consistent with the previous trend of catalytic degradation of MO. In order to theoretically investigate the relationship between the geometry and size of the materials and their piezoelectric catalytic performance, the finite element method (FEM) of COMSOL was used to simulate the piezo-response of BT-ST, BT, and 1.0BLT. Based on the TEM and SEM images, BT-ST was assumed to be a sphere with a radius of 0.5 \u03bcm, and BT and 1.0BLT were nanosheets with length \xd7 width \xd7 height of 2 \xd7 2 \xd7 0.15 \u03bcm and 1.7 \xd7 1.7 \xd7 0.1 \u03bcm, respectively. The material parameters of BLT are derived from the article reported by Zhong et al. (Text S5). In the simulation experiment shown in (g\u2013i), When subjected to a stress of 10E^{7} Pa, the maximum piezoelectric potential of the BT-ST is significantly lower than that of the BT, whereas the 1.0BLT outperforms the former two, presenting the highest piezoelectric response activity. This finding is highly consistent with the PFM as well as the catalytic results, further confirming the superiority of 1.0BLT in piezoelectric performance. Compared with the conventional spherical structures, the BT and 1.0BLT nanosheet structures prepared by the molten salt method are able to exhibit a more significant lattice deformation effect when subjected to the same compressive stress. In addition, compared to BT, the 1.0BLT nanosheets with the thinner thick and larger aspect ratio(length/thickness) have an increased sensitivity to external stress, which result in a larger piezoelectric potential, making it easier to efficiently separate photogenerated carriers. A possible mechanism of the piezo-photocatalytic process for 1.0BLT nanosheets was postulated. In a photocatalytic process, photo-generated electron-hole pairs are produced in 1.0BLT nanosheets under light irradiation. As the ECB potential of the 1.0BLT catalyst is more negative than the O2/\xb7O2 E^{\u2212} potential , the photo-generated electrons can reduce O2 to produce \xb7O2 E^{\u2212}. At the same time, the EVB potential of 1.0BLT is greater than the OHE^{\u2212}/\u22c5OH potential, which allows for the production of \u22c5OH and the oxidation of organic contaminants. However, these photo-generated carriers tend to recombine rapidly, which weakens the photocatalytic activity of 1.0BLT. Under ultrasonic excitation, the 1.0BLT nanosheets are deformed by the pressure of the cavitation bubbles, resulting in a piezoelectric effect that generates an internal piezoelectric electric field. The slanted VB will effectively attract holes, oxidizing H2O to produce \u22c5OH. Similarly, a tilted CB will accumulate electrons, reducing O2 to produce \xb7O2 E^{\u2212}. However, the piezocatalytic activity of the 1.0BLT nanosheets is weak owing to the relatively low concentration of ultrasonically excited free charges. (a\u2013b) demonstrates the schematic of charge separation and energy band structure changes of 1.0BLT under piezo-photocatalysis. With the combined action of light and ultrasound, light excites 1.0BLT to produce photogenerated carriers, while ultrasonic leads to the generation of positively polarized charges (q+) and negatively polarized charges (q-) on the opposing surfaces of 1.0BLT, resulting in the formation of a built-in piezoelectric field ((a), Eq. ). The PF can induce energy band tilt by changing the onset potential of the current density, in other words, the internal piezoelectric field can modulate the energy band. The photogenerated electrons react with the adsorbed oxygen on the surface of the catalyst to generate \xb7O2 E^{\u2212} (Eq. ), while the photogenerated holes can react with water molecules or surface-adsorbed hydroxide ions to generate \u22c5OH (Eq. ). Active species, including \xb7O2 E^{\u2212} and \u22c5OH, collaborate to degrade organic pollutants into inorganic or small molecule substances through a series of oxidation reactions (Eq. ). In short, driven by the piezoelectric potential, the photogenerated electron-hole pairs are rapidly separated and migrate to the surface to undergo redox reactions, greatly improving the photocatalytic activity of 1.0BLT, called piezoelectric enhanced photocatalysis. Based on the above experimental results, the factors responsible for the enhanced catalytic activity of 1.0BLT can be deduced. Firstly, compared with the undoped BT, the energy band structure of 1.0BLT is optimized, which exhibits a more positive valence band potential and a more negative conduction band potential. Secondly, LaE^{3+} partially replaces BiE^{3+} in the structure of Bi4Ti3O12, resulting in the distortion and deformation of the lattice, which significantly improves the piezoelectric catalytic performance of 1.0BLT. Further, the thinner sheet structure of 1.0BLT is also one of the key factors. Compared with the spherical structure of BT-ST prepared by the solid-phase method and the lamellar structure of BT prepared by the molten salt method, 1.0BLT exhibits a much thinner nanosheet morphology. This structural optimization significantly enhances the charge transfer efficiency, resulting in a substantial increase in the charge utilization efficiency of 1.0BLT in the catalytic process. In summary, the significant enhancement of the piezoelectric photocatalytic activity of 1.0BLT is the result of the synergistic effect of its optimized energy band structure, the advantages of the thinner lamellar structure, and the enhanced piezoelectric response, among other factors. The final cumulative effect of all aspects leads to the excellent catalytic performance of 1.0BLT in the field of piezoelectric photocatalytic degradation of pollutants.
