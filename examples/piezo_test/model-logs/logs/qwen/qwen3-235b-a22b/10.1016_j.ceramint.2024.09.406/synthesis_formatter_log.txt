Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': '', 'precursors': [], 'steps': ['powder was compacted into a bulk of dimensions of 15 mm × 2 mm × 2 mm', 'specimens were poled along the thickness direction'], 'characterization_techniques': ['SEM', 'EDS', 'TEM', 'HRTEM', 'DMA', 'compression testing']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
