Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'flux method', 'precursors': ['Bi2O3', 'Na2CO3', 'NaF', 'K2CO3', 'BaCO3', 'TiO2', 'Nb2O5'], 'steps': ['Precursor powders were prepared according to stoichiometric ratios.', 'Components were thoroughly mixed in ethanol via ball milling for 15 h.', 'After drying, the mixture was placed into a covered alumina crucible and calcined at 810 °C for 5 h to produce the precursor powders.', 'The mixture was heated to 1200 °C and slowly cooled to 850 °C to promote single crystal growth.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'Raman spectroscopy', 'PFM', 'd33 meter', 'LCR meter', 'ferroelectric test system']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
