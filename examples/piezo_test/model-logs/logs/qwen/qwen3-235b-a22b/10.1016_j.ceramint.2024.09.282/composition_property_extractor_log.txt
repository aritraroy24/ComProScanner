# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A schematic of the crystal structure of the BCTSO and X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of BCTSO, BCTSO-1, BCTSO-5, and BCTSO-9 are shown in , accompanied by XRD refinement patterns obtained by Rietveld refinement using the GSAS software. The XRD spectra demonstrated that all samples were composed of pure phases and exhibited a perovskite structure. As shown in , the peak of BCTSO at 56\xb0\u201356.5\xb0 is split into two peaks, with the peak intensity of the low angle greater than that of the high angle, unlike the characteristics of the cubic (C, Pm-3m), tetragonal (T, P4mm), orthorhombic (O, Amm2), and rhombic (R, R3m) phases. As the BFO content increases, the diffraction peaks first shift to a high diffraction angle (x = 0.1%) and then to a low angle (x = 0.5%), indicating a change in phase structure. When the BFO content increases to 0.9 %, the diffraction peaks shift to a high diffraction angle, and the Curie temperature of BCTSO-9 is \u22121 \xb0C (as shown in (a)), indicating that the sample exhibits a cubic phase structure near room temperature. Inset (b)\u2013(e) show the Rietveld refinement parameters of the samples, with R wp ranging from 7.23% to 8.00% and \u03c7E^{2} ranging from 1.798 to 2.138, indicating that the refined results are reliable. The XRD refinement results showed that trace amounts of substitutional elements Ca, Sn, Bi, and Fe entered the BaTiO3 crystal cells. As the BFO content increased, the sample initially transformed from a C-T-O-R four-phase coexisting structure to an R-C two-phase coexisting structure, and subsequently to a C phase structure. The variation in the phase structure of the BCTSO-xBFO ceramics is attributed to the substitution of BiE^{3+} for BaE^{2+} at the A site and FeE^{3+} for TiE^{4+} at the B site. According to , the radius for BaE^{2+} is 1.610 \xc5, for BiE^{3+} is 1.400 \xc5, for TiE^{4+} is 0.605 \xc5, and for FeE^{3+} is 0.645 \xc5. Here, R A is the radius of the A-site ions, R B is the radius of the B-site ions and R O is the radius of the OE^{2\u2212}. As illustrated in , the values of t demonstrated a decrease from 1.0519 to 1.0511, indicating that the stability of the crystal structure for BCTSO-xBFO increased with increasing BFO. Furthermore, HRTEM was used to study the crystal structures of BCTSO and BCTSO-9. The HRTEM images of BCTSO and BCTSO-9 are shown in (a) and (c), respectively, from which the atomic distribution can be clearly observed, with the corresponding inverse Fourier transform images shown in (b) and (d). As shown in (b) and (d), comparing the typical crystal structure of BaTiO3 (the coloured balls) superimposed on the TEM images, the lattice distortion of BCTSO-xBFO becomes more pronounced with increasing BFO. Meanwhile, the distance of the (110) planes is \u2248 0.273 nm for BCTSO and \u2248 0.245 nm for BCTSO-9, consistent with the XRD diffraction results shown in. This phenomenon also reveals that lattice distortion occurs when a minimal quantity of BFO is incorporated into BCTSO, which results in a phase transition as the BFO content increases. and (d) show the grain dark-field STEM images and the corresponding EDX mappings of BCTSO and BCTSO-9, respectively. The surface morphologies of BCTSO, BCTSO-1, BCTSO-5, and BCTSO-9 are shown in (e)\u2013(h), with the corresponding statistical plots of the grain size shown in O(i)-O(iV). It was observed that the grain growth was inhibited when the BFO content increased to 0.5%. The temperature-dependent relative permittivities of all the samples at 100 kHz are shown in (a) and. The Curie temperature, d 33, and dielectric constant are listed in. As the BFO content increased, the Curie temperature of the samples gradually declined, reaching its lowest value at a BFO content of 0.9%. As the BFO content increased, the lattice distortion of BCTSO-xBFO ensued, which ultimately resulted in a crystalline phase transition and a decrease in the Curie temperature. Accordingly, the ground state energy \u0394 E G of BTO and BTO substituted with Ca, Sn, Bi, and Fe is calculated using first principles, with the results shown in (b). As illustrated in (b), the ground-state energy of BTO increases with the substitution of Ca, Sn, Bi, and Fe. Consequently, the symmetry of the crystal structure increases, resulting in a reduction in the Curie temperature. (a) also shows that the maximum permittivity of the sample diminishes with an increase in BFO. According to the XRD refinement results, the number of phases in BCTSO-xBFO decreased with increasing BFO content, consequently reducing the dielectric constant. The room-temperature hysteresis loops of the samples at 1 Hz are shown in (d) and 3(e) illustrates the statistical distributions of the saturation polarisation intensity Ps, remnant polarisation intensity Pr, and coercive field Ec. As shown in (d), the P-E loop of BCTSO exhibited conventional ferroelectric behaviour. As the BFO content increases, the P-E loops exhibit relaxed ferroelectric characteristics. The contents of R-phase, O-phase, and T-phase in the samples decreased with an increase in BFO content, ultimately leading to a reduction in the orientation direction of the electrical dipoles. As a result, the Ps of BCTSO-xBFO decreased with increasing BFO content. The peak of \u03b5m gradually broadens with increasing BFO content, while the Pr of BCTSO-9 with pseudo-cubic phase at room temperature is not zero, indicating the existence of diffuse phase transition behaviour. The modified Curie-Weiss law, used to analyse the diffuse phase transition behaviour of the samples, is described as :  Here, C is a Curie constant, Tm is the temperature corresponding to the maximum dielectric constant \u03b5m, and \u03b3 represents a degree of diffuseness, respectively. When \u03b3=1 refers to normal ferroelectric behaviour, 1<\u03b3<2 refers to the diffuse phase transition, and \u03b3=2 refers to a complete diffuse phase transition. As shown in (f), the values of \u03b3 increase from 1.755 to 2.074, indicating that the relaxation of the samples increases with increasing BFO content. As for BCTSO-9, the value of \u03b3 is more than 2; hence, to better describe the diffuse phase transition behaviour, another empirical formula is used to analyse the degree of diffuseness (Eq. ):  Here, \u03be is the diffusion factor, typically ranging from 1 for a normal ferroelectric to 2 for a completely relaxed ferroelectric, while 1<\u03be<2 represents an incompletely relaxed ferroelectric, and \u0394 represents the degree of diffuse phase transition. As seen from the value of \u03be, BCTSO-9 exhibits a completely diffuse phase transition. To further understand the underlying mechanisms of the diffuse phase transition behaviour, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and UV\u2013visible absorption spectroscopy were employed to investigate the concentration of charge defects. As shown in (h), the oxygen vacancy percentages for BCTSO (unpolished) and BCTSO-9 (unpolished) were 28.329% and 62.512%, respectively, suggesting that the concentration of oxygen vacancies in BCTSO-9 is higher than that in BCTSO. Here, \u03b1 represents the light absorption constant, hv denotes the photoelectron energy, A stands for the stretching constant, and n represents the transition type. The values of Eg gradually decreased with increasing BFO content, suggesting that the concentration of charge defects in the sample increased gradually, consistent with the XPS results. Local charge defects may have been caused by FeE^{3+} replacing TiE^{4+} to maintain charge balance. Meanwhile, the VBi\u2034 and VO \xb7\xb7 generated during the sintering process may be related to the volatility of Bi2O3. Charge defects can be controlled using the following equations :  As a result, the distortion of the lattice and the chaotic distribution of local charges led to a transition from ferroelectric to relaxation ferroelectric with increasing BFO content. The piezoelectricity of BCTSO-xBFO exhibits a notable decline from 232 pC/N to 2 pC/N as the BFO content increases. This phenomenon also explains the observed decrease in the coercive field with increasing BFO content. However, the coercive field of BCTSO-9 exhibits a considerable increase, possibly attributed to the presence of several defect dipoles, such as FeTi'\u2212 VO \xb7\xb7. and VBi '''\u2212 VO \xb7\xb7', which are pinned near the domain wall and hinder the movement of the domain wall. To further understand the impact of BFO doping on the permittivity of BCTSO ceramics, the frequency-dependent permittivity and electrical modulus were measured for all the samples. The frequency-dependent electrical modulus M\u2217 (\u03c9) at different temperatures is studied for all samples. Usually, the M\u2217 (\u03c9) is the reciprocal of the complex dielectric constants \u03b5\u2217 (\u03c9), which can be expressed as \uff1a Here\uff0c \u03d5 (t) represents the variation of the electric field with time, and can be expressed by Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts \uff1a Here, \u03c4m is the relaxation time; \u03b2 is the Kohlrausch index (0<\u03b2\u22641), which expresses the degree of deviation from Debye relaxation. When \u03b2=1, the behavior is typical of Debye relaxation. The real part M\u2032 (\u03c9) and the imaginary part M\u2033 (\u03c9) can be expressed by the following equation\uff1a where \u03b5\u2032 (\u03c9) is the real part of \u03b5\u2217 (\u03c9), \u03b5\u2033 (\u03c9) is the imaginary part of \u03b5\u2217 (\u03c9), Z\u2032 (\u03c9) is the real part of Z\u2217 (\u03c9), Z\u2033 (\u03c9) is the imaginary part of Z\u2217 (\u03c9), C0= \u03b50A/d \u03b50, is the dielectric constant in vacuum, A is the sample area, d is the specimen thickness. As seen in (a) and , the M\u2033 (\u03c9) peak shifts toward a higher frequency with elevated temperature, indicating a substantial temperature dependence of the relaxation phenomenon. Moreover, the M\u2033 (\u03c9) peak is enhanced with temperature and is related to the carrier transition. In the frequency range below \u03c9max, carriers can travel long distances, whereas above \u03c9max, they are constrained to the potential and can only undergo short-range transitions. shows the variation of M\u2033 (\u03c9)/Mmax\u2033 with f/fmax at different temperatures; the M\u2033 (\u03c9)/Mmax\u2033 for BCTSO-1, BCTSO-5, and BCTSO-9 overlap well, indicating that the relaxation mechanism of the samples is the same at different temperatures. The M\u2033 (\u03c9)/Mmax\u2033 for BCTSO overlaps well at low frequencies but separates at high frequencies, possibly attributed to the different relaxation mechanisms of carriers at high frequencies. The variation of M\u2033 (\u03c9)/Mmax\u2033 as a function of f/fmax for all samples at 460 \xb0C is shown in (b). The shapes of M\u2033 (\u03c9)/Mmax\u2033 for all samples exhibit slight differences, indicating that M\u2033 (\u03c9) exhibits a discernible compositional correlation. The M\u2033 (\u03c9) for all samples at 460 \xb0C as a function of frequency are shown in (c). The full width at half maximum of the M\u2033 (\u03c9) peak was used to calculate \u03b2, with the results shown in (d). The values of \u03b2 for BCTSO, BCTSO-1, and BCTSO-5 are less than 1, indicating a non-Debye-type dielectric relaxation. In contrast, the value of \u03b2 for BCTSO-9 is 0.99, which is indicative of a Debye type dielectric relaxation. With large Ps and small Pr values, BCTSO-5 and BCTSO-9 exhibit considerable potential for energy storage applications. Using P-E curves, the energy storage density Wrec and energy storage efficiency \u03b7 of the samples can be calculated utilising Eqs. , respectively. Considering the values of Wrec and \u03b7 of BCTSO-5 reach their maximum after sintering at 1450 \xb0C (as shown in ), the green bodies of BCTSO-5 and BCTSO-9 were sintered at 1450 \xb0C and designated as BCTSO-5S and BCTSO-9S, respectively. However, the Pr and Ec of BCTSO-5S, which increase as the thickness decreases from 500 \u03bcm to 260 \u03bcm, are higher than those of BCTSO-9S (as shown in ), suggesting that the energy-storage properties of BCTSO-9S are superior to those of BCTSO-5S. To further investigate the energy storage properties of BCTSO-9S, its P-E curves of BCTSO-9S at 10 Hz are shown in (a). A local magnification of the P-E curves is shown in (b), and the inset depicts the Wrec and \u03b7 of BCTSO-9S. The Wrec of BCTSO-9S increases as the test voltage increases, reaching a maximum of 80 kV/cm (W rec,80 = 0.378 J/cmE^{3}). However, the value of \u03b7 decreases as the test voltage increases, reaching a minimum value at 80 kV/cm (\u03b780= 76.71%). The overdamping discharge-time curve of BCTSO-9S at different electric fields is shown in (c). (d) shows the time-dependent curve of Wdis, calculated using Joule's law under different electric fields. In Eq. , R (120 \u03a9) represents the test resistance, and V denotes the volume of the sample. As illustrated in (d), the discharge energy density of BCTSO-9S exhibits a clear increase with increasing testing electric field, reaching 0.303 J/cmE^{3} at 80 kV/cm, and the discharge time is T0.9\u2248100ns.

# TITLE
Study on curie temperature mechanism and electrical properties of BiFeO<inf>3</inf>-doped (Ba,Ca) (Ti,Sn)O<inf>3</inf> ceramics

# ABSTRACT
In this study, we investigated the phase structure, Curie temperature, dielectric properties, piezoelectricity, and energy-storage properties of BiFeO3 (BFO)-modified (Ba0.95Ca0.05) (Ti0.89Sn0.11)O3 (BCTSO) ceramics using both experimental and theoretical methods. The results indicated that the lattice distortion and chaotic distribution of the local charge increased with the BFO content, resulting in a phase transition and transformation from a ferroelectric to a relaxing ferroelectric. First-principles calculations revealed that the Curie temperature decreased with increasing BFO content, primarily because of an increase in the ground state energy. The variation in the permittivity of the BCTSO-xBFO ceramics with temperature and frequency is affected by the phase structure and Maxwell-Wagner interface polarisation, respectively. The electrical modulus measurements indicated that BCTSO-xBFO exhibited non-Debye-type dielectric relaxation for xÂ =Â 0.0, 0.1, and 0.5Â %, whereas BCTSO-xBFO showed Debye-type dielectric relaxation for xÂ =Â 0.9%.

# INTRODUCTION
BaTiO3 (BTO)-based ceramics are important functional materials with diverse applications in sensors, energy storage, and electronics. The electrical properties of BTO are markedly improved by doping with Ca and Sn, and have attracted considerable attention from researchers. Wang et al. designed the rhombic-orthorhombic-tetragonal-cubic (R-O-T-C) multi-phase coexistence and local structural heterogeneity of Ba(Ti1-x Sn x )O3-0.6%MnO2 ceramics by regulating the Sn content, with an ultra-high piezoelectric coefficient (d 33 > 1100 pC/N) obtained at x = 0.11. Yao et al. reported a high piezoelectric coefficient (d 33 = 697 pC/N) for the four-phase (R-O-T-C) coexistence in BaTiO3-11BaSnO3 ceramics. Zhu et al. found that (Ba0.95Ca0.05) (Ti0.89Sn0.11)O3 ceramics exhibited a R-PC-O three-phase coexisting structure at room temperature, resulting in exceptionally high piezoelectric properties (d 33 = 670 pC/N). Hadouch et al. prepared (Ba0.95Ca0.05) (Ti0.89Sn0.11)O3 ceramics using the sol-gel method and investigated their electrocaloric effect and energy storage properties. Fu et al. fabricated 0.818BaTiO3-(0.182-x)CaTiO3-xBaSnO3 ceramics with ultrahigh piezoelectricity (d 33 = 860 pC/N) through domain wall engineering. In conclusion, the phase transformation temperatures from the T phase to the O phase and from the O phase to the R phase in the Ca- and Sn-substituted BTO ceramics shifted to room temperature, which allowed BCTSO ceramics to exhibit a multi-phase coexistence structure at room temperature, thus enhancing the polarisation strength and dielectric constant. However, the low Curie temperature and poor electrical properties of Ca- and Sn-modified BTO ceramics limit their practical application. Recently, numerous studies reported significant improvements in the Curie temperature and electrical properties of BaTiO3-xBiFeO3 (BTO-xBFO) ceramics when BiFeO3 (BFO) content was over 50%. Lee et al. prepared 0.67Bi1.05(Fe0.97Ga0.03)O3-0.33BaTiO3 ceramics with high Curie temperatures and piezoelectricity (T c = 454 \xb0C, d 33 = 402 pC/N) by mixing BFO, BTO, and Ga2O3. Xun et al. prepared 0.7BFO-0.3BTO ceramics with a higher Curie temperature (T c = 528 \xb0C, d 33 = 214 pC/N) by varying the BFO content in xBFO-(1-x)BTO. However, the effects of BFO doping on the Curie temperature and the electrical properties of (Ba0.95Ca0.05) (Ti0.89Sn0.11)O3 remain unclear. In this study, the addition of less than 1 % BFO resulted in a change in BCTSO from ferroelectric to relaxation ferroelectric, a decreased Curie temperature and a loss of piezoelectric properties. However, this novel phenomenon warrants further investigation, making this study of great significance for BFO-doped BCTSO ceramics.

# CONCLUSION
In this study, BCTSO-xBFO ceramics were prepared using conventional solid-state methods and their phase structure, Curie temperature, and electrical properties were characterised and analyzed. The lattice distortion and chaotic distribution of charge defects increased in conjunction with the BFO content, resulting in a transition from R-O-T-C four-phase coexistence to the C phase and a transition from a ferroelectric (BCTSO) to relaxor ferroelectric (BCTSO-9) behaviour. Consequently, the piezoelectricity (d 33 = 232 pC/N) of BCTSO-xBFO disappeared, replaced by the optimal capacity for energy storage (W rec,80 = 0.378 J/cmE^{3}). First-principles calculations revealed that the Curie temperature decreases with increasing BFO content, attributed to an increase in the ground state energy. BCTSO, BCTSO-1, and BCTSO-5 exhibited non-Debye relaxation behaviour, whereas BCTSO-9 demonstrated Debye-type dielectric relaxation. In conclusion, this work provides a valuable reference for studying BFO-doped BCTSO ceramics while facilitating further investigation of the Curie temperature and permittivity of BTO-based ceramics.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A schematic of the crystal structure of the BCTSO and X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of BCTSO, BCTSO-1, BCTSO-5, and BCTSO-9 are shown in , accompanied by XRD refinement patterns obtained by Rietveld refinement using the GSAS software. The XRD spectra demonstrated that all samples were composed of pure phases and exhibited a perovskite structure. As shown in , the peak of BCTSO at 56\xb0\u201356.5\xb0 is split into two peaks, with the peak intensity of the low angle greater than that of the high angle, unlike the characteristics of the cubic (C, Pm-3m), tetragonal (T, P4mm), orthorhombic (O, Amm2), and rhombic (R, R3m) phases. As the BFO content increases, the diffraction peaks first shift to a high diffraction angle (x = 0.1%) and then to a low angle (x = 0.5%), indicating a change in phase structure. When the BFO content increases to 0.9 %, the diffraction peaks shift to a high diffraction angle, and the Curie temperature of BCTSO-9 is \u22121 \xb0C (as shown in (a)), indicating that the sample exhibits a cubic phase structure near room temperature. Inset (b)\u2013(e) show the Rietveld refinement parameters of the samples, with R wp ranging from 7.23% to 8.00% and \u03c7E^{2} ranging from 1.798 to 2.138, indicating that the refined results are reliable. The XRD refinement results showed that trace amounts of substitutional elements Ca, Sn, Bi, and Fe entered the BaTiO3 crystal cells. As the BFO content increased, the sample initially transformed from a C-T-O-R four-phase coexisting structure to an R-C two-phase coexisting structure, and subsequently to a C phase structure. The variation in the phase structure of the BCTSO-xBFO ceramics is attributed to the substitution of BiE^{3+} for BaE^{2+} at the A site and FeE^{3+} for TiE^{4+} at the B site. According to , the radius for BaE^{2+} is 1.610 \xc5, for BiE^{3+} is 1.400 \xc5, for TiE^{4+} is 0.605 \xc5, and for FeE^{3+} is 0.645 \xc5. Here, R A is the radius of the A-site ions, R B is the radius of the B-site ions and R O is the radius of the OE^{2\u2212}. As illustrated in , the values of t demonstrated a decrease from 1.0519 to 1.0511, indicating that the stability of the crystal structure for BCTSO-xBFO increased with increasing BFO. Furthermore, HRTEM was used to study the crystal structures of BCTSO and BCTSO-9. The HRTEM images of BCTSO and BCTSO-9 are shown in (a) and (c), respectively, from which the atomic distribution can be clearly observed, with the corresponding inverse Fourier transform images shown in (b) and (d). As shown in (b) and (d), comparing the typical crystal structure of BaTiO3 (the coloured balls) superimposed on the TEM images, the lattice distortion of BCTSO-xBFO becomes more pronounced with increasing BFO. Meanwhile, the distance of the (110) planes is \u2248 0.273 nm for BCTSO and \u2248 0.245 nm for BCTSO-9, consistent with the XRD diffraction results shown in. This phenomenon also reveals that lattice distortion occurs when a minimal quantity of BFO is incorporated into BCTSO, which results in a phase transition as the BFO content increases. and (d) show the grain dark-field STEM images and the corresponding EDX mappings of BCTSO and BCTSO-9, respectively. The surface morphologies of BCTSO, BCTSO-1, BCTSO-5, and BCTSO-9 are shown in (e)\u2013(h), with the corresponding statistical plots of the grain size shown in O(i)-O(iV). It was observed that the grain growth was inhibited when the BFO content increased to 0.5%. The temperature-dependent relative permittivities of all the samples at 100 kHz are shown in (a) and. The Curie temperature, d 33, and dielectric constant are listed in. As the BFO content increased, the Curie temperature of the samples gradually declined, reaching its lowest value at a BFO content of 0.9%. As the BFO content increased, the lattice distortion of BCTSO-xBFO ensued, which ultimately resulted in a crystalline phase transition and a decrease in the Curie temperature. Accordingly, the ground state energy \u0394 E G of BTO and BTO substituted with Ca, Sn, Bi, and Fe is calculated using first principles, with the results shown in (b). As illustrated in (b), the ground-state energy of BTO increases with the substitution of Ca, Sn, Bi, and Fe. Consequently, the symmetry of the crystal structure increases, resulting in a reduction in the Curie temperature. (a) also shows that the maximum permittivity of the sample diminishes with an increase in BFO. According to the XRD refinement results, the number of phases in BCTSO-xBFO decreased with increasing BFO content, consequently reducing the dielectric constant. The room-temperature hysteresis loops of the samples at 1 Hz are shown in (d) and 3(e) illustrates the statistical distributions of the saturation polarisation intensity Ps, remnant polarisation intensity Pr, and coercive field Ec. As shown in (d), the P-E loop of BCTSO exhibited conventional ferroelectric behaviour. As the BFO content increases, the P-E loops exhibit relaxed ferroelectric characteristics. The contents of R-phase, O-phase, and T-phase in the samples decreased with an increase in BFO content, ultimately leading to a reduction in the orientation direction of the electrical dipoles. As a result, the Ps of BCTSO-xBFO decreased with increasing BFO content. The peak of \u03b5m gradually broadens with increasing BFO content, while the Pr of BCTSO-9 with pseudo-cubic phase at room temperature is not zero, indicating the existence of diffuse phase transition behaviour. The modified Curie-Weiss law, used to analyse the diffuse phase transition behaviour of the samples, is described as :  Here, C is a Curie constant, Tm is the temperature corresponding to the maximum dielectric constant \u03b5m, and \u03b3 represents a degree of diffuseness, respectively. When \u03b3=1 refers to normal ferroelectric behaviour, 1<\u03b3<2 refers to the diffuse phase transition, and \u03b3=2 refers to a complete diffuse phase transition. As shown in (f), the values of \u03b3 increase from 1.755 to 2.074, indicating that the relaxation of the samples increases with increasing BFO content. As for BCTSO-9, the value of \u03b3 is more than 2; hence, to better describe the diffuse phase transition behaviour, another empirical formula is used to analyse the degree of diffuseness (Eq. ):  Here, \u03be is the diffusion factor, typically ranging from 1 for a normal ferroelectric to 2 for a completely relaxed ferroelectric, while 1<\u03be<2 represents an incompletely relaxed ferroelectric, and \u0394 represents the degree of diffuse phase transition. As seen from the value of \u03be, BCTSO-9 exhibits a completely diffuse phase transition. To further understand the underlying mechanisms of the diffuse phase transition behaviour, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and UV\u2013visible absorption spectroscopy were employed to investigate the concentration of charge defects. As shown in (h), the oxygen vacancy percentages for BCTSO (unpolished) and BCTSO-9 (unpolished) were 28.329% and 62.512%, respectively, suggesting that the concentration of oxygen vacancies in BCTSO-9 is higher than that in BCTSO. Here, \u03b1 represents the light absorption constant, hv denotes the photoelectron energy, A stands for the stretching constant, and n represents the transition type. The values of Eg gradually decreased with increasing BFO content, suggesting that the concentration of charge defects in the sample increased gradually, consistent with the XPS results. Local charge defects may have been caused by FeE^{3+} replacing TiE^{4+} to maintain charge balance. Meanwhile, the VBi\u2034 and VO \xb7\xb7 generated during the sintering process may be related to the volatility of Bi2O3. Charge defects can be controlled using the following equations :  As a result, the distortion of the lattice and the chaotic distribution of local charges led to a transition from ferroelectric to relaxation ferroelectric with increasing BFO content. The piezoelectricity of BCTSO-xBFO exhibits a notable decline from 232 pC/N to 2 pC/N as the BFO content increases. This phenomenon also explains the observed decrease in the coercive field with increasing BFO content. However, the coercive field of BCTSO-9 exhibits a considerable increase, possibly attributed to the presence of several defect dipoles, such as FeTi'\u2212 VO \xb7\xb7. and VBi '''\u2212 VO \xb7\xb7', which are pinned near the domain wall and hinder the movement of the domain wall. To further understand the impact of BFO doping on the permittivity of BCTSO ceramics, the frequency-dependent permittivity and electrical modulus were measured for all the samples. The frequency-dependent electrical modulus M\u2217 (\u03c9) at different temperatures is studied for all samples. Usually, the M\u2217 (\u03c9) is the reciprocal of the complex dielectric constants \u03b5\u2217 (\u03c9), which can be expressed as \uff1a Here\uff0c \u03d5 (t) represents the variation of the electric field with time, and can be expressed by Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts \uff1a Here, \u03c4m is the relaxation time; \u03b2 is the Kohlrausch index (0<\u03b2\u22641), which expresses the degree of deviation from Debye relaxation. When \u03b2=1, the behavior is typical of Debye relaxation. The real part M\u2032 (\u03c9) and the imaginary part M\u2033 (\u03c9) can be expressed by the following equation\uff1a where \u03b5\u2032 (\u03c9) is the real part of \u03b5\u2217 (\u03c9), \u03b5\u2033 (\u03c9) is the imaginary part of \u03b5\u2217 (\u03c9), Z\u2032 (\u03c9) is the real part of Z\u2217 (\u03c9), Z\u2033 (\u03c9) is the imaginary part of Z\u2217 (\u03c9), C0= \u03b50A/d \u03b50, is the dielectric constant in vacuum, A is the sample area, d is the specimen thickness. As seen in (a) and , the M\u2033 (\u03c9) peak shifts toward a higher frequency with elevated temperature, indicating a substantial temperature dependence of the relaxation phenomenon. Moreover, the M\u2033 (\u03c9) peak is enhanced with temperature and is related to the carrier transition. In the frequency range below \u03c9max, carriers can travel long distances, whereas above \u03c9max, they are constrained to the potential and can only undergo short-range transitions. shows the variation of M\u2033 (\u03c9)/Mmax\u2033 with f/fmax at different temperatures; the M\u2033 (\u03c9)/Mmax\u2033 for BCTSO-1, BCTSO-5, and BCTSO-9 overlap well, indicating that the relaxation mechanism of the samples is the same at different temperatures. The M\u2033 (\u03c9)/Mmax\u2033 for BCTSO overlaps well at low frequencies but separates at high frequencies, possibly attributed to the different relaxation mechanisms of carriers at high frequencies. The variation of M\u2033 (\u03c9)/Mmax\u2033 as a function of f/fmax for all samples at 460 \xb0C is shown in (b). The shapes of M\u2033 (\u03c9)/Mmax\u2033 for all samples exhibit slight differences, indicating that M\u2033 (\u03c9) exhibits a discernible compositional correlation. The M\u2033 (\u03c9) for all samples at 460 \xb0C as a function of frequency are shown in (c). The full width at half maximum of the M\u2033 (\u03c9) peak was used to calculate \u03b2, with the results shown in (d). The values of \u03b2 for BCTSO, BCTSO-1, and BCTSO-5 are less than 1, indicating a non-Debye-type dielectric relaxation. In contrast, the value of \u03b2 for BCTSO-9 is 0.99, which is indicative of a Debye type dielectric relaxation. With large Ps and small Pr values, BCTSO-5 and BCTSO-9 exhibit considerable potential for energy storage applications. Using P-E curves, the energy storage density Wrec and energy storage efficiency \u03b7 of the samples can be calculated utilising Eqs. , respectively. Considering the values of Wrec and \u03b7 of BCTSO-5 reach their maximum after sintering at 1450 \xb0C (as shown in ), the green bodies of BCTSO-5 and BCTSO-9 were sintered at 1450 \xb0C and designated as BCTSO-5S and BCTSO-9S, respectively. However, the Pr and Ec of BCTSO-5S, which increase as the thickness decreases from 500 \u03bcm to 260 \u03bcm, are higher than those of BCTSO-9S (as shown in ), suggesting that the energy-storage properties of BCTSO-9S are superior to those of BCTSO-5S. To further investigate the energy storage properties of BCTSO-9S, its P-E curves of BCTSO-9S at 10 Hz are shown in (a). A local magnification of the P-E curves is shown in (b), and the inset depicts the Wrec and \u03b7 of BCTSO-9S. The Wrec of BCTSO-9S increases as the test voltage increases, reaching a maximum of 80 kV/cm (W rec,80 = 0.378 J/cmE^{3}). However, the value of \u03b7 decreases as the test voltage increases, reaching a minimum value at 80 kV/cm (\u03b780= 76.71%). The overdamping discharge-time curve of BCTSO-9S at different electric fields is shown in (c). (d) shows the time-dependent curve of Wdis, calculated using Joule's law under different electric fields. In Eq. , R (120 \u03a9) represents the test resistance, and V denotes the volume of the sample. As illustrated in (d), the discharge energy density of BCTSO-9S exhibits a clear increase with increasing testing electric field, reaching 0.303 J/cmE^{3} at 80 kV/cm, and the discharge time is T0.9\u2248100ns.

# TITLE
Study on curie temperature mechanism and electrical properties of BiFeO<inf>3</inf>-doped (Ba,Ca) (Ti,Sn)O<inf>3</inf> ceramics

# ABSTRACT
In this study, we investigated the phase structure, Curie temperature, dielectric properties, piezoelectricity, and energy-storage properties of BiFeO3 (BFO)-modified (Ba0.95Ca0.05) (Ti0.89Sn0.11)O3 (BCTSO) ceramics using both experimental and theoretical methods. The results indicated that the lattice distortion and chaotic distribution of the local charge increased with the BFO content, resulting in a phase transition and transformation from a ferroelectric to a relaxing ferroelectric. First-principles calculations revealed that the Curie temperature decreased with increasing BFO content, primarily because of an increase in the ground state energy. The variation in the permittivity of the BCTSO-xBFO ceramics with temperature and frequency is affected by the phase structure and Maxwell-Wagner interface polarisation, respectively. The electrical modulus measurements indicated that BCTSO-xBFO exhibited non-Debye-type dielectric relaxation for xÂ =Â 0.0, 0.1, and 0.5Â %, whereas BCTSO-xBFO showed Debye-type dielectric relaxation for xÂ =Â 0.9%.

# INTRODUCTION
BaTiO3 (BTO)-based ceramics are important functional materials with diverse applications in sensors, energy storage, and electronics. The electrical properties of BTO are markedly improved by doping with Ca and Sn, and have attracted considerable attention from researchers. Wang et al. designed the rhombic-orthorhombic-tetragonal-cubic (R-O-T-C) multi-phase coexistence and local structural heterogeneity of Ba(Ti1-x Sn x )O3-0.6%MnO2 ceramics by regulating the Sn content, with an ultra-high piezoelectric coefficient (d 33 > 1100 pC/N) obtained at x = 0.11. Yao et al. reported a high piezoelectric coefficient (d 33 = 697 pC/N) for the four-phase (R-O-T-C) coexistence in BaTiO3-11BaSnO3 ceramics. Zhu et al. found that (Ba0.95Ca0.05) (Ti0.89Sn0.11)O3 ceramics exhibited a R-PC-O three-phase coexisting structure at room temperature, resulting in exceptionally high piezoelectric properties (d 33 = 670 pC/N). Hadouch et al. prepared (Ba0.95Ca0.05) (Ti0.89Sn0.11)O3 ceramics using the sol-gel method and investigated their electrocaloric effect and energy storage properties. Fu et al. fabricated 0.818BaTiO3-(0.182-x)CaTiO3-xBaSnO3 ceramics with ultrahigh piezoelectricity (d 33 = 860 pC/N) through domain wall engineering. In conclusion, the phase transformation temperatures from the T phase to the O phase and from the O phase to the R phase in the Ca- and Sn-substituted BTO ceramics shifted to room temperature, which allowed BCTSO ceramics to exhibit a multi-phase coexistence structure at room temperature, thus enhancing the polarisation strength and dielectric constant. However, the low Curie temperature and poor electrical properties of Ca- and Sn-modified BTO ceramics limit their practical application. Recently, numerous studies reported significant improvements in the Curie temperature and electrical properties of BaTiO3-xBiFeO3 (BTO-xBFO) ceramics when BiFeO3 (BFO) content was over 50%. Lee et al. prepared 0.67Bi1.05(Fe0.97Ga0.03)O3-0.33BaTiO3 ceramics with high Curie temperatures and piezoelectricity (T c = 454 \xb0C, d 33 = 402 pC/N) by mixing BFO, BTO, and Ga2O3. Xun et al. prepared 0.7BFO-0.3BTO ceramics with a higher Curie temperature (T c = 528 \xb0C, d 33 = 214 pC/N) by varying the BFO content in xBFO-(1-x)BTO. However, the effects of BFO doping on the Curie temperature and the electrical properties of (Ba0.95Ca0.05) (Ti0.89Sn0.11)O3 remain unclear. In this study, the addition of less than 1 % BFO resulted in a change in BCTSO from ferroelectric to relaxation ferroelectric, a decreased Curie temperature and a loss of piezoelectric properties. However, this novel phenomenon warrants further investigation, making this study of great significance for BFO-doped BCTSO ceramics.

# CONCLUSION
In this study, BCTSO-xBFO ceramics were prepared using conventional solid-state methods and their phase structure, Curie temperature, and electrical properties were characterised and analyzed. The lattice distortion and chaotic distribution of charge defects increased in conjunction with the BFO content, resulting in a transition from R-O-T-C four-phase coexistence to the C phase and a transition from a ferroelectric (BCTSO) to relaxor ferroelectric (BCTSO-9) behaviour. Consequently, the piezoelectricity (d 33 = 232 pC/N) of BCTSO-xBFO disappeared, replaced by the optimal capacity for energy storage (W rec,80 = 0.378 J/cmE^{3}). First-principles calculations revealed that the Curie temperature decreases with increasing BFO content, attributed to an increase in the ground state energy. BCTSO, BCTSO-1, and BCTSO-5 exhibited non-Debye relaxation behaviour, whereas BCTSO-9 demonstrated Debye-type dielectric relaxation. In conclusion, this work provides a valuable reference for studying BFO-doped BCTSO ceramics while facilitating further investigation of the Curie temperature and permittivity of BTO-based ceramics.
