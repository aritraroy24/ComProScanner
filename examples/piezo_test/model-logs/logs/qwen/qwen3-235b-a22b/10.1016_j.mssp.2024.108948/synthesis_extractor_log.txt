0.67BiFeO3-0.33BaTiO3-0.02Bi(Zn0.5Ti0.5)O3-xBiAlO3 (abbreviated as BF-BT-BZT-xBA, 0.00\u2264x \u2264 0.05) ceramics were prepared by conventional solid phase sintering method. Raw materials Bi2O3(Xilong Scientfic-Shantou, 99 %), Fe2O3(Xilong Scientfic-Shantou, 99 %), TiO2(Xilong Scientfic-Shantou, 99 %), BaCO3(Xilong Scientfic-Shantou, 99 %), nano-Al2O3(Macklin, 99.9 %), and ZnO(Xilong Scientfic-Shantou, 99.9 %) were weighed according to the chemical formula, and then adequately ball-milled for 24 h. The powder was pre-fired in a muffle furnace held at 780 \xb0C for 4h at a heating rate of 2 \xb0C/min. Then, 8 wt% of polyvinyl alcohol(PVA) was added as a binder and a small amount of the powder was pressed into 8 mm diameter disks at a uniaxial pressure of 12 MPa. These disks were sintered at a ramp rate of 2 \xb0C/min for 3 h at 600 \xb0C to remove the PVA and at 1000 \xb0C for 6 h to obtain ceramic wafers. Finally, the ceramic discs with double-sided silver electrodes were polarized by placing them in silicon oil at 120 \xb0C and holding them at a DC field of 5 kV/cm for 20 min. The samples were scanned using an X-ray diffractometer(XRD) (D8 advance; Bruker Inc.) with a Cu target at an angular range of 20\xb0\u201380\xb0 at a rate of 6\xb0/min. The cross-section microstructure of the ceramics was observed using a scanning electron microscope(SEM) (FEG-450; FEI Inc., USA). Transmission electron microscope(TEM) (Tecnai G2 F30 S-TWIN, FEI, USA) was used to observe the microdomain structure at high definition. The temperature dependence of d 33 of polarized samples after aging for 24 h was tested by using a high-temperature in-situ d 33 measurement instrument (TZFD-900, Harbin Julang Technology Co. Measurements of high-temperature dielectric properties were made by LCR analyzer (keysight, 4980A). P-E curves were tested using a ferroelectric detection system (TF anylzer 2000hs, Germany).

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
shows the XRD diffraction patterns of 0.67BF-0.33BT-0.02BZT-xBA (0.00\u2264x \u2264 0.05) ceramics. The standard diffraction patterns of BT-C phase (PDF#74\u20131963) and BF-R phase (PDF#71\u20132494) are also listed below the figure for reference. The diffraction peaks of all the samples correspond to those of the ABO3-type compounds, indicating that the ceramics of this system are of perovskite structure , and contain a small amount of Bi25FeO40 impurity (PDF#46\u20130416) around ca.28\xb0. The extended XRD patterns (c) show that the diffraction angle (referred to as 2\u03b8phase (hkl)) of the main peak appears at ca. 39\xb0 for 2\u03b8 Pm 3\u203em (111). As shown in (b), a single 2\u03b8 Pm 3\u203em (200) peak was observed. The introduction of BA changed the ceramic phase structure, and the localized magnified image shows that the double peak near 39\xb0 gradually evolved into a single peak with the increase of BA content, indicating that the R and Pc phases coexisted at 0.00\u2264x \u2264 0.04, and the Pc phase was Pc at x = 0.05. In particular, 0.67BF-0.33BT-0.02BZT-0.01BA ceramics is the structure in which the R-Pc phase coexists. In order to provide more comprehensive and accurate information about the ceramic phase structure, we have refined the XRD data of 0.67BF-0.33BT-0.02BZT-xBA ceramics by Rietveld. The experimental data are in good agreement with the fitting results, which are reliable with R wp around 6.0 %. (a\u2013c) shows the phase fractions of the ceramics, with C R /C Pc of 69/31, 73/27 and 66/34 at x = 0, 0.01 and 0.03, respectively. It can be seen that the proportion of the R phase volume increases with the introduction of BA (x < 0.01). Excess BA increases the phase fraction of Pc phase. (d) shows the trend of lattice distortion of the ceramics, The degree of lattice distortion induced by BA doping (x = 0\u20130.05) does not vary widely, with c/a ratios generally in the range of 1\u20131.002. The distortion reaches a maximum c/a \u223c1.002 when x = 0.03. The tolerance factor of BiAlO3 (t = 1.003) is higher than that of Bi(Zn0.5Ti0.5)O3 (t = 0.83), implying that the introduction of BA reduces the lattice distortion caused by the high tetragonal degree of BZT, which makes it easy for the switching of ferroelectric domains. shows the SEM micrographs of 0.67BF-0.33BT-0.02BZT-xBA ceramic sections. The small amount of BA doping promotes the grain growth, and the maximum average grain size D\u03bb = 8.08 \u03bcm. When doped with BA = 0.03 mol, the average grain size decreases to 5.34 \u03bcm, and the proportion of small-size grains gradually increases, indicating that the grain size is highly sensitive to the BA content. The increase in grain boundary density favors the formation and growth of nuclei, but limits the growth of grains, resulting in a large number of fine grains, and the substitution of FeE^{3+} ions by AlE^{3+} ions leads to an increase in nucleation sites, which reduces the crystal symmetry, and also leads to smaller grain size, which is not conducive to the continuation of grain transfer and hinders the growth process of grains. From the sintering process, the melting point of Bi2O3 is 825 \xb0C, which is much lower than the melting point of Al2O3 of 2054 \xb0C. When the BA doping increases, the residual AlE^{3+} ions are more likely to gather at the grain boundaries, which inhibits the grain growth. In order to investigate the high temperature piezoelectric properties of 0.67BF-0.33BT+0.02BZT + xBA ceramics, we performed in-situ d 33 tests as shown in (a). The ceramics have excellent d 33 values at high temperatures. A small amount of BA doping can substantially improve the high-temperature piezoelectric properties. X = 0.01 ceramics have d 33 as high as 801 pC/N along with a high T dr = 361 \xb0C. X = 0.03 ceramics have a reduced piezoelectricity at high temperatures of d 33 = 509 pC/N, T dr = 314 \xb0C, but the high-temperature piezoelectric fluctuations are reduced. Moderate amount of BA doping favors high temperature piezoelectricity. (c) and (d) show the P-E and I-E loops of the ceramics measured at 50 kV/cm. X = 0.01 ceramic exhibits a maximum residual polarization of 15.62 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, whereas the undoped ceramics with x = 0.05 ceramic have a finer P-E curve with a very small residual polarization of 7.12 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, as shown in (b). A small amount of doping of BA (x < 0.03 mol) increases the polar phase share and improves the domain ordering, while the decrease in E c promotes more non-180\xb0 domain flips, thus increasing d 33 and P r. The decrease in x = 0.03 ceramic E c is attributed to the decrease in the average grain size and increase in the grain boundary volume. Increased BA doping up to 0.05 is subjected to an increase in E c due to the action of coercive field, and the decomposition of the long-range ferroelectric phase produces a nonpolar phase, which hampers the domain evolution process and decreases the polarizability. shows the dielectric temperature spectrum of 0.67BF-0.33BT-0.02BZT-xBA (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05) ceramics at frequencies of 1 kHz, 10 kHz and 100 kHz, and the temperature range of room temperature-550 \xb0C. The measured relative dielectric constant (\u025b r) and dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) show a regular variation with increasing temperature, with T c around 420\xb0C\u2013440 \xb0C. Overall, the introduction of BA reduces the tan\u03b4, i.e., the leakage conduction loss of the samples at elevated temperatures , and also results in a decrease in the maximum dielectric constant \u025b m. Since the radius of AlE^{3+} (0.535 \xc5) is similar to that of FeE^{3+} (0.645 \xc5) and TiE^{4+} (0.605 \xc5) at the B-site, and the radii of BiE^{3+} (1.03 \xc5) and BaE^{2+} (1.35 \xc5) at the A-site are much larger than the radius of the B-site ions, the doped AlE^{3+} easily replaces the ions at the B-site. However, the doped AlE^{3+} causes fluctuations in the components while replacing the ions in the B-site. With the increase of AlE^{3+} doping content, the long-range ordered ferroelectric phase structure is disrupted and the cell structure is more disordered, and the increase of AlE^{3+} content will make the state of the B-site ions in the sample show more disorder. The disorder of the cell structure leads to more pronounced relaxation characteristics of the doped BA samples. In order to quantitatively study the relaxation of 0.67BF-0.33BT-0.02BZT-xBA ceramics, the dispersion factor \u03b3 can be obtained by fitting the Curie-Weiss law, which is expressed as follows. In Eq. , \u025b r represents the dielectric constant, \u025b m and T m represent the maximum dielectric constant and the corresponding temperature at the maximum dielectric constant. c is the Curie-Exis constant and \u03b3 is the relaxation factor (1 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 2). In a classical relaxor, \u03b3 = 2; in an ideal ferroelectric \u03b3 = 1; and in a relaxing ferroelectric 1 < \u03b3 < 2. The \u03b3 values of the doped ceramics are all greater than 1, indicating that all are relaxing ferroelectrics.BA doping enhances the relaxation properties of the ceramics and the \u03b3 value increases to 1.869 at x = 0.03 as shown in. shows the domain structure of 0.67BF-0.33BT-0.02BZT-0.01BA ceramics after polarization. A locally distributed inhomogeneous domain structure can be observed, with the presence of Moir\xe9 stripes(blue dashed box) with a width of about 1.7 nm in (a) and thumb-like domains in (c). These domain structures are identified as polar nanoregions (PNRs) with non-homogeneous local compositions , formed due to the enhancement of aligned disordering induced by ion doping substitutions. The lattice spacing d 1 is 0.157 nm and d 2 is 0.256 nm for the two enlarged lattices in (b).
