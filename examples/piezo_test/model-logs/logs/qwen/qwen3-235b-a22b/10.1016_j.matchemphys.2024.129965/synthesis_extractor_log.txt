Ba0\xb792Ca0\xb708Ti0\xb795Zr0.05-xLa (BCZT-xLa) ceramics powders with different La contents (x = 0, 0.004, 0.008, 0.012, 0.016, 0.020 and 0.024) were prepared by sol\u2013gel method using Ba(CH3COO)2, Ca(NO3)2\xb74H2O, Zr(NO3)4\xb75H2O, Ti(OC4H9)4 and La(NO3)3\xb7nH2O as raw materials. Secondly, the solution was placed in the oven at 120 \xb0C for 10 h to obtain gels. Next, the gels were calcined at 900 \xb0C for 2 h to form precursor powders. The powders were pressed into disks with a diameter of 20 mm and the disks were embedded in alumina. Then, the disks were sintered at 1300 \xb0C for 4 h in air with a heating rate of 5 \xb0C/min. The phase structure of the precursor powders and ceramics was characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Smartlab, Japan) with a 2\u03b8 range of 5\xb0\u201380\xb0 under Cu-K\u03b1 radiation. The microstructure of the ceramics was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, phenom prox, Netherlands). The Vickers hardness of the ceramics was measured by a Vickers hardness tester (VH1202, Wilson). A load of 1000 gf was applied to the polished ceramic surface, with a retention time of 6 s. The concentrations of oxygen vacancies were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, K-ALPHA, UK). The relative dielectric constant (\u0511 r) and dielectric loss (tan \u03b4) were presented with various frequencies and temperatures (30 \xb0C-180 \xb0C) using a dielectric testing instrument (HDMS-1000 V, China) coupled with an LCR instrument (WK\u20136500 B, UK). The hysteresis loops of the polarisation-electric field (P-E) were observed using a radiant precision workstation (RTI-Multiferroic \u2161, USA). The piezoelectric coefficient (d 33 ) was observed using a quasistatic piezoelectric meter (ZJ-3, China). The values of density were measured by an electron density balance (QL-300SD, China).

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
shows the XRD patterns of BCZT-xLa ceramic precursor powders and ceramic powders in the 2\u03b8 range of 5\xb0\u201380\xb0 at room temperature. This result suggested that LaE^{3+} was incorporated into the lattice of the ceramics. The characteristic peak of BCZT-xLa shifted to a lower 2\u03b8 range direction with the increase in x, as shown in (b). This finding indicated that the lattice parameters could increase with La dopants, because the A site (BaE^{2+} and CaE^{2+} site) of the ABO3 structure was occupied by LaE^{3+}. The interplanar crystal spacing began to decrease when LaE^{3+} (1.06 \xc5) replaced CaE^{2+} (0.99 \xc5) in the structure. The XRD patterns of BCZT-xLa ceramics with different x contents at room temperature are shown in (c). They differed from the XRD patterns of precursor powders, and the changes were shown in the 2\u03b8 range of 44\xb0\u201346\xb0. With an increase in LaE^{3+} contents, the characteristic peak of the ceramics split firstly and then gradually became a single peak. According to the PDF cards, the split of the characteristic peak could be found when the ceramics possessed T or O phase. The XRD patterns were refined at about x = 0, 0.008 and 0.020 to study the phase transformation, and the results are shown in (e). The results of Rietveld refinement using the GASA \u2161 program are shown in (e). The proportions of T phase increased from 76.68 % to 85.06 % with an increase in LaE^{3+} contents from 0 to 0.008. However, when the LaE^{3+} contents increased to 0.020, the proportions of T phase decreased, whereas the proportions of O phase showed an opposite trend. The Rietveld refinement results suggested that the phase structure of the samples transformed from T phase to O phase at room temperature with increasing LaE^{3+} contents. The SEM images of BCZT-xLa ceramics are shown in. When the x contents increased from 0 to 0.008, the grain size displayed an increasing trend initially and then began to decrease with further increasing of x. The density of the ceramics showed a trend similar to that of grain size, due to the reduced oxygen vacancies in the structure when LaE^{3+} replaced for the A position in the ceramics. In the process of LaE^{3+} replacing the position of CaE^{2+}, some cation-oxygen bonds could be generated, whereas the concentrations of oxygen vacancies showed an opposite trend, which enlarged the grain size apparently. With the increase in LaE^{3+} contents, some LaE^{3+} could gradually diffuse from A site to B site, showing a change in donor doping to acceptor doping in the structure. XPS was applied to verify the variation of oxygen vacancies concentrations in the structure, and the XPS spectra of O 1s binding states for BCZT-xLa ceramics (x = 0, 0.004, 0.008 and 0.020) are shown in. Two peaks of the binding energy were observed at 529.01 and 531.06 eV. According to literature, the peak at 531.06 eV represents oxygen vacancies, and the peak at 529.01 eV corresponds to cation-oxygen bonds (oxygen of lattice). The results showed that the ratio of oxygen vacancies (OVacancy/OCation-oxygen bonds) appeared to have a decreasing trend from 0.54 to 0.39 firstly and then the ratio increased from 0.39 to 0.52 when the x contents increased to 0.020. The corresponding hardness value accessed with the actual contact area had the following relationship (Eq. ): where F represents the applied load in Kgf (1 Kgf = 9.80665 N), d is the average length of the diagonal of the indentation in mm and the \u03b8 is the angle between the opposite surfaces of the rhomboid indenter at 136\xb0. shows that the Vickers hardness of the ceramics displayed a decreased trend with increasing x. The reason for this phenomenon is that the increased lattice parameter when a larger radius of LaE^{3+} entered the lattice, leading to the reduction in lattice energy and increase in the fragility of BCZT-xLa ceramics. The ratio of oxygen vacancies increased and the average strength of C\u2013O bonds (cation-oxygen bonds) decreased when the x contents were 0.020, which may be an important other reason for the decrease in Vickers hardness values. The fluctuations of phase compositions may have an influence on the value of Vickers hardness for ceramics according to literature report. (a) reveals the relative permittivity of BCZT-xLa ceramics at 30 \xb0C\u2212180 \xb0C under a frequency of 10 kHz. The reason is the enlarged grains and densified structure in the ceramics because LaE^{3+} entered the lattice. The Curie temperature peak broadened and exhibited a certain diffusion phase transition with increasing addition of x. (b) shows the maximum dielectric constant of ceramics with varying x contents at various frequencies (100 Hz\u20131 MHz). This phenomenon could be attributed to the difference in valence when LaE^{3+} occupied the position of CaE^{2+} in the structure, which caused an electronic relaxation polarisation with the emergence of excessive electrons. (c) and show the Curie temperature (T C) with various La contents. The T C showed a decreasing trend with an increase in La contents, due to the oxygen octahedral centres of Ti and Zr shifting in outside direction after LaE^{3+} replaced CaE^{2+}. shows the relation for ln (1/\u0511 r-1/\u0511m) with ln (T-T m) at 10 kHz of BCZT-xLa ceramics with various x contents. The degree of diffused phase transition could be explored by the modified Curie\u2013Weiss law (Eq. ): where \u0511 r represents the relative dielectric constant, \u0511 m is the maximum dielectric constant, T m is the temperature for the maximum dielectric constant, C\u2032 is the modified Curie\u2013Weiss constant, and \u03b3 corresponds to the diffuseness exponent (slope of ln (1/\u0511 r-1/\u0511 m) versus ln (T-T m)). When the \u03b3 value is 1, the ceramics feature the characteristic of normal ferroelectricity. When the \u03b3 value is equal to 2, the ceramics become a relaxor ferroelectricity. The \u03b3 value showed a decreasing trend with an increase in x. Then, the \u03b3 values increased again with x contents greater than 0.008. The loops of P-E hysteresis of BCZT-xLa ceramics with various x contents are shown in (a). The piezoelectric constant (d 33) of BCZT-xLa is shown in (b) and. The d 33 of the ceramics changed with various x contents, and d 33 reached the maximum value when x was 0.016. When the grain size is larger than 1 \u03bcm, the d 33 increases as the grain size decreases, because the width of 90\xb0 domains could maintain a same trend with grain sizes changed. It could increase the activity of 90\xb0 domains when the grain size decreases, leading to enhanced piezoelectric properties. However, when the grain size is less than 1 \u03bcm, an opposite variation trend for d 33 could be detected.
