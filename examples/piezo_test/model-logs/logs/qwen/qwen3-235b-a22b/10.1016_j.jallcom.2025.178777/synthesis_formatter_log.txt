Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'solid-phase reaction method', 'precursors': ['BaCO3', 'CaCO3', 'TiO2', 'ZrO2'], 'steps': ['Raw materials (BaCO3, CaCO3, TiO2, ZrO2) were weighed according to stoichiometric ratios.', 'Weighed powder and ethanol were mixed and ball-milled for 12 hours.', 'Mixture was dried at 120 °C in an oven.', 'Dried powder was calcined at 1250 °C for 5 hours.', 'Calcined powder was ball-milled again for 12 hours.', 'Ball-milled powder was pressed into desired shapes using a cold isostatic press at 30 MPa for 15 minutes.', 'Pressed samples were sintered at 1400–1500 °C for 4 hours to obtain dense ceramic plates.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'SEM']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
