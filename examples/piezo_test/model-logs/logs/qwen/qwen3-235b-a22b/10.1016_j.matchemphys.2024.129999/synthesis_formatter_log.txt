Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'solvothermal', 'precursors': [], 'steps': ['synthesized with varying weight percentages of Li using the solvothermal approach', 'powders pressed into pellets', 'pellets sintered in a closed environment at 1100 °C for 2 h'], 'characterization_techniques': ['X-ray Diffraction (XRD)', 'Elemental Analysis', 'Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)', 'Dielectric Impedance Spectroscopy']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
