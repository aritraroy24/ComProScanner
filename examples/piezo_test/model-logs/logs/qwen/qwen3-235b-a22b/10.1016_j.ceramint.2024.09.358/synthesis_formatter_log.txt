Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'High-temperature solid-state reaction', 'precursors': ['BaCO3', 'CaCO3', 'ZrO2', 'SnO2', 'TiO2'], 'steps': ['Stoichiometric ratios of precursors were mixed', 'Ground for 2 hours in a mortar and pestle', 'Milled for 4 hours in ethanol with zirconia balls in a low-energy ball mill', 'Dried and lumps pulverized, then calcined at 1200°C for 4 hours in air', 'Reground and molded into pellets with 1 wt% PVA as a binder', 'Pellets heated at 650°C for 1 hour to burn off PVA', 'Sintered at 1400°C for 4 hours in air'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'FE-SEM', 'EDX', 'Dielectric spectroscopy', 'Piezoelectric testing', 'UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
