**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'Slicing and Poling', 'precursors': ['PIMNT single crystals (0.30PIN-0.40PMN-0.30PT)'], 'steps': ['The PIMNT samples were sliced into 5×5×0.5 mm³ wafers.', 'Silver electrodes were painted onto sample surfaces and fired at 750 °C for 30 min to form electrodes.', 'The samples were then poled with an electric field of 10 kV/cm at 140 °C for 15 min in silicone oil and then slowly cooled to room temperature while the electric field was halved.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['Quasi-static d33 meter', 'Impedance analyzer', 'Ferroelectric analyzer']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
