(1-x)Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3-xBaTiO3 (x=0.02, 0.06, 0.10, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, abbreviated as NBBT100x) ceramics, (Na0.5Bi0.5+ x )0.94Ba0.06TiO3+1.41 x (x=0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, abbreviated as NBBT6+Bi100x) ceramics, (Na0.5Bi0.5)0.94Sr x Ba0.06TiO3+ x (x=0.005,0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, abbreviated as NBBT6+Sr100x) ceramics were prepared via conventional solid state reaction route. Before weighing, all raw materials, Na2CO3 (99.9%), BaCO3 (99.9%), Bi2O3 (99.9%), TiO2 (98%) and SrCO3 (99.0%) (all from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China), were dried in an oven at approximately 120\xb0C for 5 hours. The weighed raw materials were mixed by ball milling for 12 hours and ethanol was added as a medium. The dried raw materials were calcined at 850\xb0C for 2 hours to obtain the object composition of NBBT100x ceramics. Then the calcined powder was secondly ball milled for another 12 hours to reduce the particle size. After dried in an oven, the calcined powder was granulated by passing through 80 mesh sieve. Wherein, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (99.0%) (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China) aqueous solution (5 wt. %) was added as a binder, and the amount is approximately 10 wt.% of the powder mass. Before sintering, the green bodies were heated to 800\xb0C for 2 hours to remove the binder. Then, NBBT100x green bodies were sintered at 1140\xb0C-1180\xb0C for 2 hours. Then the polished ceramic disks were heated to 1100\xb0C for 1 hour and then removed directly from the furnace to air for a rapid cooling. The quenched ceramics are labeled as QS, while the ceramics normally cooled in furnace is labeled as NS. X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku Smartlab diffractometer, Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) was used to characterize the structure. Prior to conducting XRD measurements, all ceramics samples were polished and annealed at 500\xb0C. The temperature dependence of dielectric properties was measured using a precision impedance analyzer (4294A, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) equipped with a programmable furnace, and the heating/cooling rate is 2\xb0C/min. Before charactering the piezoelectric properties, all ceramic samples were poled under an electrical field of 4-7 MV/m for 5 minutes for ceramic samples with different compositions at approximately room temperature. The piezoelectric response was measured at approximately room temperature using a quasi-static d33 meter (ZJ-6AN, Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China). The depolarization temperature (T d) was obtained by analyzing the thermally stimulated depolarization current (TSDC) curves, which were obtained using an 6517B electrometer (Keithley Instruments, Inc., Cleveland, Ohio, USA) equipped with a programmable furnace. The heating rate is 5\xb0C/min. Electrical hysteresis loops were measured at room temperature using a modified Sawyer-Tower circuit (Polyktech, State College, USA).

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
As shown in , all NBBT100x ceramic samples present a perovskite structure without observable second phase. With increasing the content of BT, the peaks appear at a lower angle, indicating an increased c-axial lattice constant. This is related to the larger ionic radius of BaE^{2+} (1.610 \xc5) compared with BiE^{3+} (1.360 \xc5) or NaE^{+} (1.390 \xc5). With increasing BT content, the crystal structure changes from pseudo-cubic (or weak rhombohedral) to tetragonal symmetry, as can be seen from the evolution of feature peaks at approximately 40\xb0 and 46.5\xb0 , agreeing with the previous reports. For perovskite rhombohedral symmetry, there are splitting peak at approximately 40\xb0 and a single peak at approximately 46.5\xb0 ; for perovskite tetragonal symmetry there is a single peak at approximately 40\xb0 and splitting peak at approximately 46.5\xb0. The dielectric properties of NBBT100x ceramics are shown in. For NBBT6 ceramics, there is no sharp change of dielectric constant with temperature, indicating a diffusion phase transition between lower temperature phase and high temperature phase. However, for NBBT100x ceramics with lower and higher BT content, the phase transition takes place over a relative narrow temperature range, as demonstrated by the sharp variation regions on dielectric constant vs. temperature curves. The different phase transition behaviors of NBT-BT ceramics could be related to the different domain configurations formed during cooling. For NBBT100x ceramics with lower and higher BT content, long-range ferroelectric order (with larger domain size) formed around the phase transition temperature upon cooling. However, for NBBT100x ceramics of MPB compositions, only nanodomain or polar nanoregion generates over a wide temperature upon cooling. For relaxor ferroelectrics, due to the heterogeneity of local polar structures , for example the difference in polarization directions and sizes of nanodomains (or polar nanoregions), there are different relaxation time under a stimulation of small AC electrical field for these local polar structures. Therefore, the difference of dielectric constant \u0394\u03b5 r between a lower and a higher frequency (both below 1 MHz) can reflect the degree of the dielectric dispersion or local polar heterogeneity. As shown in , the frequency dependence of dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) at approximately 25\xb0C (over a range: 1 kHz-1M Hz) are compared for NBBT100x ceramics. Wherein, the relationship between \u03b5 r and ln(f) can be fitted into a line, and the degree of the local polar heterogeneity (or the dielectric dispersion) of a relaxor ferroelectric can be characterized by the slope of the fitted line \u03b5 r \u223c ln(f). As shown in , with increasing BT content, the slope of the fitted \u03b5 r \u223c ln(f) line first increases then decreases, indicating a similar evolution trend of the local polar heterogeneity with BT content for NBT-BT ceramics. As shown in and , both the dielectric and piezoelectric response at approximately 25\xb0C show a similar trend with BT content as that of slope of the fitted \u03b5 r \u223c ln(f) line. Wherein, NBBT6 ceramic shows the maximum \u03b5 r and d33. Then there is lower thermal stability of low temperature phase, as demonstrated by the lower T d for NBBTx ceramics with composition at MPB, as shown in. After quenched from 1100\xb0C to air directly, all of the XRD patterns of NBBT100x ceramics shift to a lower angle to some extent, as shown in , indicating a higher c-axial lattice constant, which may be caused by the residual stress after the quenching in air. Additionally, as shown in , the XRD pattern of quenched NBBT2 ceramic shows observable splitting at approximately 40\xb0 and a single-like peak appears at approximately 46.5\xb0, indicating an enhanced rhombohedral symmetry. For quenched NBBT6 ceramic, as shown in , a single-like peak appears at approximately 40\xb0 and the peak at approximately 46.5\xb0 shows enhanced splitting, indicating an enhanced tetragonal symmetry. For both quenched NBBT2 and NBBT6 ceramics, the enhanced non-cubic symmetry could be caused by the increased lattice distortion and the increase of lamellar domain after quenching. However, for quenched NBBT100x ceramics with x \u2265 0.10, as shown in -(), a single-like peak appears at approximately 40\xb0 and the relative proportion (I(002)/ I(200)) of the two peaks at approximately 46.5\xb0 increases. This could be related to thermal stress-induced texture upon the quenching , which may be accompanied by the increase of domain size for x=0.10 or the increase of 90\xb0 domain wall for x>0.10. After quenched, NBBT6 ceramic shows a sharp phase transition between lower temperature phase and high temperature phase over a narrow temperature range, as shown by the sharp changed region of \u03b5 r \u223c T curves in. For QS samples with other compositions, the sharp phase transition appears at temperature above 215\xb0C, higher than that of NS samples. As shown in , the frequency dependence (over a range: 1kHz-1MHz) of dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) at approximately 25\xb0C are compared. Slope of the fitted line \u03b5 r \u223c ln(f) is shown in. Compared with the slope of the fitted line \u03b5 r \u223c ln(f) of NS samples , after quenched, the slope decreases for all NBBT100x ceramics, indicating a quenching induced decrease of local polar heterogeneity. Similarly, both electrical response (\u03b5 r and d33) at approximately 25\xb0C decreases after quenched, as shown in. It should be noted that, the highest electrical response appears at x=0.06 before quenching , however, after quenched the highest electrical response presents at x=0.10. As shown in -() and -(), the trend with BT content of electrical response agrees well with that of local polar heterogeneity, no matter before and after quenching. Additionally, due to enhanced thermal stability of low temperature phase, the T d increases 27\u223c50\xb0C, as shown in Fig. S3. The ferroelectric properties are also compared for NS and QS ceramic samples, as shown in. Different from the electrical properties shown , the evolution trend with BT content for P r and E C show little change after quenching. It may be related to the electrical field induced change of local polar structure for the ceramics with MPB composition. Accordingly, for NBT-BT ceramics there is a close correlation between the local polar heterogeneity and the electrical response (\u03b5 r and d33) obtained, especially for the MPB compositions. From the discussion above, for NBT-BT ceramics, higher local polar heterogeneity could facilitate a higher piezoelectric response, especially for the ceramics with MPB composition. In this work, different from the way of substitution using a dopant, additional Sr or Bi was added before the calcination process, in addition to the needed mass of raw materials under the stoichiometric requirement of NBBT6 ceramics. These non-stoichiometrically modified ceramics are labeled as Sr- and Bi-modified NBBT6. The structure, local polar heterogeneity and piezoelectric properties at approximately 25\xb0C were characterized. As shown in , Sr-modified NBBT6 ceramics show increased tetragonal symmetry with Sr content x \u2264 0.03, as can be seen from the increased splitting of the diffraction peaks at approximately 46.5\xb0. S4(a), the frequency dependence (over a range: 1kHz-1MHz) of dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) at approximately 25\xb0C are compared. Slope of the fitted line \u03b5 r \u223c ln(f) is shown in. The maximum piezoelectric response (201 pC/N) appears at x=0.03, where there is the lowest depolarization temperature. For Bi-modified NBBT6 ceramics, as shown in , with increasing Bi content the ceramics show decreased tetragonal symmetry, as can be seen from the decreased splitting of the diffraction peaks at approximately 46.5\xb0. At x=0.04, the splitting of the diffraction peaks becomes indiscernible. S4(b) shows the frequency dependence (over a range: 1kHz-1MHz) of dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) at approximately 25\xb0C. Slope of the fitted line \u03b5 r \u223c ln(f) is shown in. The maximum piezoelectric response (207 pC/N) appears at x=0.02, where there is an obviously decreased depolarization temperature. As can be seen from the results shown in , though the change trend of crystal symmetry with Sr and Bi modification to NBBT6 ceramics are opposite to each other, both the two modifications show that, where there is a higher degree of local polar heterogeneity, there is a higher piezoelectric response. It indicates that, a) the local polar heterogeneity of a relaxor ferroelectric ceramic could be as an important index of a higher piezoelectric response; b) the factors inducing a higher local polar heterogeneity could be priorly treated; and c) higher thermal stability of Sr-modified NBBT6 than that of Bi-modification may be related to the higher tetragonality.
