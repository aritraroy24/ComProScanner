# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
As shown in , all NBBT100x ceramic samples present a perovskite structure without observable second phase. With increasing the content of BT, the peaks appear at a lower angle, indicating an increased c-axial lattice constant. This is related to the larger ionic radius of BaE^{2+} (1.610 \xc5) compared with BiE^{3+} (1.360 \xc5) or NaE^{+} (1.390 \xc5). With increasing BT content, the crystal structure changes from pseudo-cubic (or weak rhombohedral) to tetragonal symmetry, as can be seen from the evolution of feature peaks at approximately 40\xb0 and 46.5\xb0 , agreeing with the previous reports. For perovskite rhombohedral symmetry, there are splitting peak at approximately 40\xb0 and a single peak at approximately 46.5\xb0 ; for perovskite tetragonal symmetry there is a single peak at approximately 40\xb0 and splitting peak at approximately 46.5\xb0. The dielectric properties of NBBT100x ceramics are shown in. For NBBT6 ceramics, there is no sharp change of dielectric constant with temperature, indicating a diffusion phase transition between lower temperature phase and high temperature phase. However, for NBBT100x ceramics with lower and higher BT content, the phase transition takes place over a relative narrow temperature range, as demonstrated by the sharp variation regions on dielectric constant vs. temperature curves. The different phase transition behaviors of NBT-BT ceramics could be related to the different domain configurations formed during cooling. For NBBT100x ceramics with lower and higher BT content, long-range ferroelectric order (with larger domain size) formed around the phase transition temperature upon cooling. However, for NBBT100x ceramics of MPB compositions, only nanodomain or polar nanoregion generates over a wide temperature upon cooling. For relaxor ferroelectrics, due to the heterogeneity of local polar structures , for example the difference in polarization directions and sizes of nanodomains (or polar nanoregions), there are different relaxation time under a stimulation of small AC electrical field for these local polar structures. Therefore, the difference of dielectric constant \u0394\u03b5 r between a lower and a higher frequency (both below 1 MHz) can reflect the degree of the dielectric dispersion or local polar heterogeneity. As shown in , the frequency dependence of dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) at approximately 25\xb0C (over a range: 1 kHz-1M Hz) are compared for NBBT100x ceramics. Wherein, the relationship between \u03b5 r and ln(f) can be fitted into a line, and the degree of the local polar heterogeneity (or the dielectric dispersion) of a relaxor ferroelectric can be characterized by the slope of the fitted line \u03b5 r \u223c ln(f). As shown in , with increasing BT content, the slope of the fitted \u03b5 r \u223c ln(f) line first increases then decreases, indicating a similar evolution trend of the local polar heterogeneity with BT content for NBT-BT ceramics. As shown in and , both the dielectric and piezoelectric response at approximately 25\xb0C show a similar trend with BT content as that of slope of the fitted \u03b5 r \u223c ln(f) line. Wherein, NBBT6 ceramic shows the maximum \u03b5 r and d33. Then there is lower thermal stability of low temperature phase, as demonstrated by the lower T d for NBBTx ceramics with composition at MPB, as shown in. After quenched from 1100\xb0C to air directly, all of the XRD patterns of NBBT100x ceramics shift to a lower angle to some extent, as shown in , indicating a higher c-axial lattice constant, which may be caused by the residual stress after the quenching in air. Additionally, as shown in , the XRD pattern of quenched NBBT2 ceramic shows observable splitting at approximately 40\xb0 and a single-like peak appears at approximately 46.5\xb0, indicating an enhanced rhombohedral symmetry. For quenched NBBT6 ceramic, as shown in , a single-like peak appears at approximately 40\xb0 and the peak at approximately 46.5\xb0 shows enhanced splitting, indicating an enhanced tetragonal symmetry. For both quenched NBBT2 and NBBT6 ceramics, the enhanced non-cubic symmetry could be caused by the increased lattice distortion and the increase of lamellar domain after quenching. However, for quenched NBBT100x ceramics with x \u2265 0.10, as shown in -(), a single-like peak appears at approximately 40\xb0 and the relative proportion (I(002)/ I(200)) of the two peaks at approximately 46.5\xb0 increases. This could be related to thermal stress-induced texture upon the quenching , which may be accompanied by the increase of domain size for x=0.10 or the increase of 90\xb0 domain wall for x>0.10. After quenched, NBBT6 ceramic shows a sharp phase transition between lower temperature phase and high temperature phase over a narrow temperature range, as shown by the sharp changed region of \u03b5 r \u223c T curves in. For QS samples with other compositions, the sharp phase transition appears at temperature above 215\xb0C, higher than that of NS samples. As shown in , the frequency dependence (over a range: 1kHz-1MHz) of dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) at approximately 25\xb0C are compared. Slope of the fitted line \u03b5 r \u223c ln(f) is shown in. Compared with the slope of the fitted line \u03b5 r \u223c ln(f) of NS samples , after quenched, the slope decreases for all NBBT100x ceramics, indicating a quenching induced decrease of local polar heterogeneity. Similarly, both electrical response (\u03b5 r and d33) at approximately 25\xb0C decreases after quenched, as shown in. It should be noted that, the highest electrical response appears at x=0.06 before quenching , however, after quenched the highest electrical response presents at x=0.10. As shown in -() and -(), the trend with BT content of electrical response agrees well with that of local polar heterogeneity, no matter before and after quenching. Additionally, due to enhanced thermal stability of low temperature phase, the T d increases 27\u223c50\xb0C, as shown in Fig. S3. The ferroelectric properties are also compared for NS and QS ceramic samples, as shown in. Different from the electrical properties shown , the evolution trend with BT content for P r and E C show little change after quenching. It may be related to the electrical field induced change of local polar structure for the ceramics with MPB composition. Accordingly, for NBT-BT ceramics there is a close correlation between the local polar heterogeneity and the electrical response (\u03b5 r and d33) obtained, especially for the MPB compositions. From the discussion above, for NBT-BT ceramics, higher local polar heterogeneity could facilitate a higher piezoelectric response, especially for the ceramics with MPB composition. In this work, different from the way of substitution using a dopant, additional Sr or Bi was added before the calcination process, in addition to the needed mass of raw materials under the stoichiometric requirement of NBBT6 ceramics. These non-stoichiometrically modified ceramics are labeled as Sr- and Bi-modified NBBT6. The structure, local polar heterogeneity and piezoelectric properties at approximately 25\xb0C were characterized. As shown in , Sr-modified NBBT6 ceramics show increased tetragonal symmetry with Sr content x \u2264 0.03, as can be seen from the increased splitting of the diffraction peaks at approximately 46.5\xb0. S4(a), the frequency dependence (over a range: 1kHz-1MHz) of dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) at approximately 25\xb0C are compared. Slope of the fitted line \u03b5 r \u223c ln(f) is shown in. The maximum piezoelectric response (201 pC/N) appears at x=0.03, where there is the lowest depolarization temperature. For Bi-modified NBBT6 ceramics, as shown in , with increasing Bi content the ceramics show decreased tetragonal symmetry, as can be seen from the decreased splitting of the diffraction peaks at approximately 46.5\xb0. At x=0.04, the splitting of the diffraction peaks becomes indiscernible. S4(b) shows the frequency dependence (over a range: 1kHz-1MHz) of dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) at approximately 25\xb0C. Slope of the fitted line \u03b5 r \u223c ln(f) is shown in. The maximum piezoelectric response (207 pC/N) appears at x=0.02, where there is an obviously decreased depolarization temperature. As can be seen from the results shown in , though the change trend of crystal symmetry with Sr and Bi modification to NBBT6 ceramics are opposite to each other, both the two modifications show that, where there is a higher degree of local polar heterogeneity, there is a higher piezoelectric response. It indicates that, a) the local polar heterogeneity of a relaxor ferroelectric ceramic could be as an important index of a higher piezoelectric response; b) the factors inducing a higher local polar heterogeneity could be priorly treated; and c) higher thermal stability of Sr-modified NBBT6 than that of Bi-modification may be related to the higher tetragonality.

# ABSTRACT
For (1-x)Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3-xBaTiO3 (NBT-BT) ceramics, the highest piezoelectric performances appears at morphotropic phase boundary (x=0.06â¼0.10). In this work, comparative study on normally cooled and quenched NBT-BT ceramics was conducted. It was verified in a case study on NBBT6 ceramics by tuning the local polar heterogeneity using Bi or Sr nonstoichiometric modification. And the highest d33 â¼ 207 pC/N is obtained in Bi-modified NBT-BT ceramics. It demonstrates that, to obtain a higher d33, the factors affecting local polar heterogeneity of piezoelectric ceramics could be preferentially considered.

# INTRODUCTION
Currently, the majority of piezoelectric materials used in the electronic device market are primarily Pb(Ti,Zr)O3 (PZT)-based. Over the past few decades, lead-free piezoelectric ceramics have covered several base systems , for example the BaTiO3 (BT) based, K0.5Na0.5NbO3 (KNN) based, Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3 (NBT) based, and BiFeO3 (BFO) based. Wherein, NBT-based ceramics have attracted much interest for the possible high-power applications , for example in the field of ultrasound, based on their superior strain response under electrical field stimulation. Moreover, NBT-based ceramics exhibit a more stable mechanical quality factor under the fluctuations of temperature or vibrational velocity when compared to PZT. However, the smaller positive piezoelectric response d33 (often < 200 pC/N) and lower depolarization temperature T d (often < 200 \xb0C) limit their applications. For (1-x)Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3-xBaTiO3 ((1-x)NBT-xBT) ceramics, the ceramics of composition at morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) (0.06 \u2264 x \u2264 0.1) show a higher d33 but lower T d , which could be attributed to the coexistence of microdomains and nanodomains of the MPB composition. As demonstrated by transmission electron microscope (TEM) , the complex domain configuration can be outlined by the difference in size of domain or polar nanoregions, crystal symmetry, direction of polarization. The complex domain configuration boosted high piezoelectric performances can also be demonstrated in KNN-based ceramics. It has been reported, non-stoichiometric , chemical modification or substitution  can break the long-range ferroelectric order and form nanometer polar regions or nanodomains, leading to higher dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) and d33. For example, recently, a d33 of approximately 220 pC/N has been reported for NBT-BT ceramics by BaAlO2.5 modification. While, the strategies of constructing composite ceramics or quenching, commonly improve the T d but at the expense of partial d33. It has been found, for the NBT-BT ceramics of compositions away from MPB, quenching can result in an increment of domain size but negligible change of phase fraction. However, for the NBT-BT ceramics of MPB compositions, quenching can induce both increased volume fraction of polar nanoregion  and the formation of long-range order, for example the lamellar domain structure. However, there are few reports on the relationship between piezoelectric properties and local polar heterogeneity in NBT-BT system. In this work, the structure and electrical properties of (1-x)NBT-xBT (x=0.02, 0.06, 0.10, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, abbreviated as NBBT100x) ceramics were comparatively studied between normally cooled ceramic samples (NS) and quenched ceramic samples (QS). It was verified in a case study on NBBT6 ceramics by tuning the local polar heterogeneity using Sr or Bi nonstoichiometric modification. The highest d33 \u223c 207 pC/N is obtained in Bi-modified NBBT6 ceramics. It demonstrates that, to obtain a higher d33, the factors affecting local polar heterogeneity of piezoelectric ceramics could be preferentially considered.

# CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the structures and electrical properties of NBT-BT ceramics were comparatively studied between NS and QS samples. For both NS and QS NBBT100x ceramics, the electrical properties show the same evolution trend as local polar heterogeneity with increasing BT content. The close correlation between them is verified in a case study on NBBT6 ceramics by tuning local polar heterogeneity using Sr and Bi nonstoichiometric modification. Both Sr- and Bi-modified NBBT6 ceramics show enhanced degree of local polar heterogeneity and improved piezoelectric response (> 200 pC/N). The highest d33 approximately 207 pC/N is obtained in Bi-modified NBBT6 ceramics. This work demonstrates that, to obtain a higher d33, the factors affecting local polar heterogeneity of piezoelectric ceramics could be priorly considered.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
As shown in , all NBBT100x ceramic samples present a perovskite structure without observable second phase. With increasing the content of BT, the peaks appear at a lower angle, indicating an increased c-axial lattice constant. This is related to the larger ionic radius of BaE^{2+} (1.610 \xc5) compared with BiE^{3+} (1.360 \xc5) or NaE^{+} (1.390 \xc5). With increasing BT content, the crystal structure changes from pseudo-cubic (or weak rhombohedral) to tetragonal symmetry, as can be seen from the evolution of feature peaks at approximately 40\xb0 and 46.5\xb0 , agreeing with the previous reports. For perovskite rhombohedral symmetry, there are splitting peak at approximately 40\xb0 and a single peak at approximately 46.5\xb0 ; for perovskite tetragonal symmetry there is a single peak at approximately 40\xb0 and splitting peak at approximately 46.5\xb0. The dielectric properties of NBBT100x ceramics are shown in. For NBBT6 ceramics, there is no sharp change of dielectric constant with temperature, indicating a diffusion phase transition between lower temperature phase and high temperature phase. However, for NBBT100x ceramics with lower and higher BT content, the phase transition takes place over a relative narrow temperature range, as demonstrated by the sharp variation regions on dielectric constant vs. temperature curves. The different phase transition behaviors of NBT-BT ceramics could be related to the different domain configurations formed during cooling. For NBBT100x ceramics with lower and higher BT content, long-range ferroelectric order (with larger domain size) formed around the phase transition temperature upon cooling. However, for NBBT100x ceramics of MPB compositions, only nanodomain or polar nanoregion generates over a wide temperature upon cooling. For relaxor ferroelectrics, due to the heterogeneity of local polar structures , for example the difference in polarization directions and sizes of nanodomains (or polar nanoregions), there are different relaxation time under a stimulation of small AC electrical field for these local polar structures. Therefore, the difference of dielectric constant \u0394\u03b5 r between a lower and a higher frequency (both below 1 MHz) can reflect the degree of the dielectric dispersion or local polar heterogeneity. As shown in , the frequency dependence of dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) at approximately 25\xb0C (over a range: 1 kHz-1M Hz) are compared for NBBT100x ceramics. Wherein, the relationship between \u03b5 r and ln(f) can be fitted into a line, and the degree of the local polar heterogeneity (or the dielectric dispersion) of a relaxor ferroelectric can be characterized by the slope of the fitted line \u03b5 r \u223c ln(f). As shown in , with increasing BT content, the slope of the fitted \u03b5 r \u223c ln(f) line first increases then decreases, indicating a similar evolution trend of the local polar heterogeneity with BT content for NBT-BT ceramics. As shown in and , both the dielectric and piezoelectric response at approximately 25\xb0C show a similar trend with BT content as that of slope of the fitted \u03b5 r \u223c ln(f) line. Wherein, NBBT6 ceramic shows the maximum \u03b5 r and d33. Then there is lower thermal stability of low temperature phase, as demonstrated by the lower T d for NBBTx ceramics with composition at MPB, as shown in. After quenched from 1100\xb0C to air directly, all of the XRD patterns of NBBT100x ceramics shift to a lower angle to some extent, as shown in , indicating a higher c-axial lattice constant, which may be caused by the residual stress after the quenching in air. Additionally, as shown in , the XRD pattern of quenched NBBT2 ceramic shows observable splitting at approximately 40\xb0 and a single-like peak appears at approximately 46.5\xb0, indicating an enhanced rhombohedral symmetry. For quenched NBBT6 ceramic, as shown in , a single-like peak appears at approximately 40\xb0 and the peak at approximately 46.5\xb0 shows enhanced splitting, indicating an enhanced tetragonal symmetry. For both quenched NBBT2 and NBBT6 ceramics, the enhanced non-cubic symmetry could be caused by the increased lattice distortion and the increase of lamellar domain after quenching. However, for quenched NBBT100x ceramics with x \u2265 0.10, as shown in -(), a single-like peak appears at approximately 40\xb0 and the relative proportion (I(002)/ I(200)) of the two peaks at approximately 46.5\xb0 increases. This could be related to thermal stress-induced texture upon the quenching , which may be accompanied by the increase of domain size for x=0.10 or the increase of 90\xb0 domain wall for x>0.10. After quenched, NBBT6 ceramic shows a sharp phase transition between lower temperature phase and high temperature phase over a narrow temperature range, as shown by the sharp changed region of \u03b5 r \u223c T curves in. For QS samples with other compositions, the sharp phase transition appears at temperature above 215\xb0C, higher than that of NS samples. As shown in , the frequency dependence (over a range: 1kHz-1MHz) of dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) at approximately 25\xb0C are compared. Slope of the fitted line \u03b5 r \u223c ln(f) is shown in. Compared with the slope of the fitted line \u03b5 r \u223c ln(f) of NS samples , after quenched, the slope decreases for all NBBT100x ceramics, indicating a quenching induced decrease of local polar heterogeneity. Similarly, both electrical response (\u03b5 r and d33) at approximately 25\xb0C decreases after quenched, as shown in. It should be noted that, the highest electrical response appears at x=0.06 before quenching , however, after quenched the highest electrical response presents at x=0.10. As shown in -() and -(), the trend with BT content of electrical response agrees well with that of local polar heterogeneity, no matter before and after quenching. Additionally, due to enhanced thermal stability of low temperature phase, the T d increases 27\u223c50\xb0C, as shown in Fig. S3. The ferroelectric properties are also compared for NS and QS ceramic samples, as shown in. Different from the electrical properties shown , the evolution trend with BT content for P r and E C show little change after quenching. It may be related to the electrical field induced change of local polar structure for the ceramics with MPB composition. Accordingly, for NBT-BT ceramics there is a close correlation between the local polar heterogeneity and the electrical response (\u03b5 r and d33) obtained, especially for the MPB compositions. From the discussion above, for NBT-BT ceramics, higher local polar heterogeneity could facilitate a higher piezoelectric response, especially for the ceramics with MPB composition. In this work, different from the way of substitution using a dopant, additional Sr or Bi was added before the calcination process, in addition to the needed mass of raw materials under the stoichiometric requirement of NBBT6 ceramics. These non-stoichiometrically modified ceramics are labeled as Sr- and Bi-modified NBBT6. The structure, local polar heterogeneity and piezoelectric properties at approximately 25\xb0C were characterized. As shown in , Sr-modified NBBT6 ceramics show increased tetragonal symmetry with Sr content x \u2264 0.03, as can be seen from the increased splitting of the diffraction peaks at approximately 46.5\xb0. S4(a), the frequency dependence (over a range: 1kHz-1MHz) of dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) at approximately 25\xb0C are compared. Slope of the fitted line \u03b5 r \u223c ln(f) is shown in. The maximum piezoelectric response (201 pC/N) appears at x=0.03, where there is the lowest depolarization temperature. For Bi-modified NBBT6 ceramics, as shown in , with increasing Bi content the ceramics show decreased tetragonal symmetry, as can be seen from the decreased splitting of the diffraction peaks at approximately 46.5\xb0. At x=0.04, the splitting of the diffraction peaks becomes indiscernible. S4(b) shows the frequency dependence (over a range: 1kHz-1MHz) of dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) at approximately 25\xb0C. Slope of the fitted line \u03b5 r \u223c ln(f) is shown in. The maximum piezoelectric response (207 pC/N) appears at x=0.02, where there is an obviously decreased depolarization temperature. As can be seen from the results shown in , though the change trend of crystal symmetry with Sr and Bi modification to NBBT6 ceramics are opposite to each other, both the two modifications show that, where there is a higher degree of local polar heterogeneity, there is a higher piezoelectric response. It indicates that, a) the local polar heterogeneity of a relaxor ferroelectric ceramic could be as an important index of a higher piezoelectric response; b) the factors inducing a higher local polar heterogeneity could be priorly treated; and c) higher thermal stability of Sr-modified NBBT6 than that of Bi-modification may be related to the higher tetragonality.

# INTRODUCTION
Currently, the majority of piezoelectric materials used in the electronic device market are primarily Pb(Ti,Zr)O3 (PZT)-based. Over the past few decades, lead-free piezoelectric ceramics have covered several base systems , for example the BaTiO3 (BT) based, K0.5Na0.5NbO3 (KNN) based, Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3 (NBT) based, and BiFeO3 (BFO) based. Wherein, NBT-based ceramics have attracted much interest for the possible high-power applications , for example in the field of ultrasound, based on their superior strain response under electrical field stimulation. Moreover, NBT-based ceramics exhibit a more stable mechanical quality factor under the fluctuations of temperature or vibrational velocity when compared to PZT. However, the smaller positive piezoelectric response d33 (often < 200 pC/N) and lower depolarization temperature T d (often < 200 \xb0C) limit their applications. For (1-x)Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3-xBaTiO3 ((1-x)NBT-xBT) ceramics, the ceramics of composition at morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) (0.06 \u2264 x \u2264 0.1) show a higher d33 but lower T d , which could be attributed to the coexistence of microdomains and nanodomains of the MPB composition. As demonstrated by transmission electron microscope (TEM) , the complex domain configuration can be outlined by the difference in size of domain or polar nanoregions, crystal symmetry, direction of polarization. The complex domain configuration boosted high piezoelectric performances can also be demonstrated in KNN-based ceramics. It has been reported, non-stoichiometric , chemical modification or substitution  can break the long-range ferroelectric order and form nanometer polar regions or nanodomains, leading to higher dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) and d33. For example, recently, a d33 of approximately 220 pC/N has been reported for NBT-BT ceramics by BaAlO2.5 modification. While, the strategies of constructing composite ceramics or quenching, commonly improve the T d but at the expense of partial d33. It has been found, for the NBT-BT ceramics of compositions away from MPB, quenching can result in an increment of domain size but negligible change of phase fraction. However, for the NBT-BT ceramics of MPB compositions, quenching can induce both increased volume fraction of polar nanoregion  and the formation of long-range order, for example the lamellar domain structure. However, there are few reports on the relationship between piezoelectric properties and local polar heterogeneity in NBT-BT system. In this work, the structure and electrical properties of (1-x)NBT-xBT (x=0.02, 0.06, 0.10, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, abbreviated as NBBT100x) ceramics were comparatively studied between normally cooled ceramic samples (NS) and quenched ceramic samples (QS). It was verified in a case study on NBBT6 ceramics by tuning the local polar heterogeneity using Sr or Bi nonstoichiometric modification. The highest d33 \u223c 207 pC/N is obtained in Bi-modified NBBT6 ceramics. It demonstrates that, to obtain a higher d33, the factors affecting local polar heterogeneity of piezoelectric ceramics could be preferentially considered.

# CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the structures and electrical properties of NBT-BT ceramics were comparatively studied between NS and QS samples. For both NS and QS NBBT100x ceramics, the electrical properties show the same evolution trend as local polar heterogeneity with increasing BT content. The close correlation between them is verified in a case study on NBBT6 ceramics by tuning local polar heterogeneity using Sr and Bi nonstoichiometric modification. Both Sr- and Bi-modified NBBT6 ceramics show enhanced degree of local polar heterogeneity and improved piezoelectric response (> 200 pC/N). The highest d33 approximately 207 pC/N is obtained in Bi-modified NBBT6 ceramics. This work demonstrates that, to obtain a higher d33, the factors affecting local polar heterogeneity of piezoelectric ceramics could be priorly considered.

**Notes**:
- Write complete chemical formulas (e.g. '(Use the abbreviation key-value pair to track the abbreviations while extracting composition-property keywords). Don't use abbreviations, but you can use different environment if multiple compositions have different d33 values in different environments. For e.g.: 'LiNbO3-Air' and 'LiNbO3-Vacuum'.
- If multiple compositions are mentioned with different d33 values, extract all compositions mentioning different type/environment with a '-' and coreresponding d33 values.
- Mos of the formula are provided in ABSTRACT or INTRODUCTION or first part of EXPERIMENTAL SYNTHESIS.
- Use element symbols (e.g. 'K' not 'Potassium')
- For compositions with variables:
   * If multiple d33 values exist: Extract all compositions by substituting each variable value
   * If single d33 value: Extract only the best composition
- Prioritize data from tables
- Preserve proper chemical notation including:
   * Subscripts for atom counts
   * Parentheses for grouped elements
   * Proper fraction formatting
- Include the measurement unit for d33 values (usually pC/N or pm/V)
- Identify the broader family/class of materials - can be abbreviated forms
- Include if there is any doping in the composition using '+' sign with the composition, e.g. 'LiNbO3 + 2%wt Mg'
- Don't remove brackets or parentheses from the chemical formula which is already in the composition. Also, sometimes fractions are written before the composition (mostly in ()) for composition mixtures, don't remove them.
- Don't modify the abbreviation from referenced papers unless full composition is not available.
- ALWAYS follow the asked JSON format. DON'T write any extra information such as note points or explanations.
