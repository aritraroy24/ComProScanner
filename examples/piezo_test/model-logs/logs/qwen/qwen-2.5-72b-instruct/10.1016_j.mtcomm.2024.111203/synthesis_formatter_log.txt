Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'solid-state reaction', 'precursors': [], 'steps': ['The raw materials were first prepared according to the calculated ratios and then put in the planetary ball mill for 4 hours.', 'After drying the slurry at 100 °C and calcined at 850 °C for 2 hours.', 'After drying the slurry using the same method, 7 wt.% of binder (polyvinyl alcohol) was added and then the powder was well grounded.', 'Finally, the powder was pressed into 10 mm diameter discs and calcined at 1100 °C for 2 hours.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'SEM', 'XPS', 'LCR analyzer', 'DC resistivity measurement', 'd33 meter']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
