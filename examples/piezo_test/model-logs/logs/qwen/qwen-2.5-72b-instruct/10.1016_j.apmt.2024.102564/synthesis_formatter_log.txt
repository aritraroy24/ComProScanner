Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'Solution Deposition', 'precursors': ['L-phenylalanyl-L-leucine (Phe-Leu)', 'L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (Leu-Phe)', 'methanol'], 'steps': ['Prepare a 1 mg/mL solution of dipeptide in methanol.', 'Drop 10 μL of the dipeptide solution onto a silicon substrate.', 'Remove the solvent by one of the following methods: (1) spontaneous evaporation, (2) forced drying with warm air, or (3) spin-coating at 3000 rpm.', 'For vapor saturation, place the silicon substrate with the deposited dipeptide film in a sealed Petri dish containing an organic solvent to create saturated vapor (P/P0=1).', 'Keep the Petri dish at room temperature for 10 minutes to 24 hours.', 'After saturation, dry the film with warm air at 45°C.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRPD', 'Raman Spectroscopy', 'AFM', 'PFM']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
