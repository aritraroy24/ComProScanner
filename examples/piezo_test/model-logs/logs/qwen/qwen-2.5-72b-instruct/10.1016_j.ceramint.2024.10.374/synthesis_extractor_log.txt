To eliminate the effect of stoichiometry, 0.957K0.48Na0.52Nb0.96Sb0.04O3-0.04Bi0.5Na0.5ZrO3-0.003CaZrO3 was selected to construct PPB to flatten the barrier of polarization rotation. High-purity raw materials, including Na2CO3 (99.8 %), K2CO3 (99.8 %), Nb2O5 (99.5 %), Sb2O3 (98 %), Bi2O3 (99 %), ZrO2 (99 %), CaCO3 (99 %) (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd) were weighed and once ball milled with ethyl alcohol for 12 h at 300 rpm according to the stoichiometry ratio. After drying, the powders were divided into 4 batches, which were calcined at 800, 850, 900, and 950 \xb0C, respectively. After that, a part of the powders was pressed into compacts with a diameter of 10 mm at 200 MPa using a cold isostatic press (abbreviated as 800-1st, 850-1st, 900-1st, 950-1st, where \u20181st\u2019 refers to the reactants only experienced once ball milling) (designated as group A). Subsequently, the residual powders were subjected to another ball-milling for 24 h (abbreviated as 800-2nd, 850-2nd, 900-2nd, 950-2nd, where \u20182nd\u2019 refers to the reactants experienced twice ball milling) (designated as group B) and pressed into pellets under the same conditions. Finally, all pellets were sintered by a two-step sintering (TSS) technique, while the temperature was rapidly raised to 1190 \xb0C with a heating rate of 10 \xb0C/min, and then rapidly cooled down to 1090 \xb0C and dwelled for 5 h before naturally cooled down. The crystalline structure was examined at ambient temperature by X-ray diffractometer (D/Max2550VB+/PC, Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) with Cu-K\u03b1 radiation under 40 kV/200 mA. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Merlin Compact, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) was utilized to investigate the microstructure of calcined powders and ceramics. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) (FeatureMax, Oxford Instruments, UK) was utilized to detect of element distribution and semiquantitatively determine element content. Before electrical measurement, two sides of the as-sintered samples were printed with silver paste and baked at 600 \xb0C for 30 min to form the electrodes. The piezoelectric coefficient (d33) the poled samples (5 kV/cm for 30 min) was measured by a quasi-static d33 m (ZJ-3 A, China) after aging for 20 h. Besides, the in-situ temperature dependence of d33 was measured by a high-temperature piezoelectric tester (TZFD-D33T, Harbin Julang Technology Co. The planar electromechanical coupling factor (kp) and phase angle (\u03b8) were measured using an impedance analyzer (MFIA 5 MHz, Zurich, Switzerland), while the kp were calculated by the following equation: where fr and fa is resonance frequency and antiresonance frequency, respectively. Temperature-dependent dielectric properties were measured via a precise LCR meter (E4980, Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) equipped with a temperature controller (TP94, Linkam, Surrey, UK) at a heating rate of 3 \xb0C/min. The electric field strain (S-E) and the ferroelectric hysteresis (P-E) loop were measured using a ferroelectric tester (aixACCT TF Analyzer 2000, Germany) equipped with a laser interferometer vibrometer (SP-S120/500, SIOS Me\u03b2technik GmbH, Germany).

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The XRD patterns of KNN powders calcined at different temperatures are shown in , which indicates that a perovskite structure has been obtained after calcination of all powders. The extensive researches have argued that the reactions of alkali carbonates and niobium pentoxide will be between 300 \xb0C to 700 \xb0C, and a pure perovskite structure could be constructed when the temperature is higher than 700 \xb0C. In our case, apart from expected KNN perovskite peaks, the shoulder distributed at a higher angle of each diffraction peak are observed in all powders (black arrow), which can be indexed to NaNbO3 (NN) (PDF#01-071-0947). Therefore, the coexistence of multiple phases indicated by the splitting of multiple diffraction peaks in all powder mixtures suggests the chemical inhomogeneity of A-site elements in KNN perovskite. To clearly characterize the chemical inhomogeneity of calcined powder, the refined {110} peak fitted via the Gauss-Lorentz function according to diffraction peaks of NaNbO3 (NN) (PDF#01-071-0947, red index line) and KNbO3 (KN) (PDF#01-071-0947, light blue index line) are presented in. According to the PDF card, three fitting peaks from left to right correspond to KNbO3, K-rich KNN, and NaNbO3, respectively. Meanwhile, KNbO3 almost diminishes after increasing the calcination temperature up to 900 \xb0C. Additionally, after second ball milling, the diffraction peak of KNbO3 almost disappears while the diffraction peak of NaNbO3 is weakened, especially under the condition that the calcination temperature is enhanced up to 900 \xb0C ((g and h)). In order to further determine the composition heterogeneity of different powders, EDS elemental analysis of powders calcined at different temperatures after once and twice ball milling is presented in , respectively. To accurately characterize the chemical heterogeneity, EDS spectra near both larger and smaller particles are tested to semiquantitatively determine element content. Meanwhile, most particles are mainly Na-rich phase, and only a slight of K-rich phase is detected , owing to that Na2CO3 has higher reactivity to react with Nb2O5/ZrO2 than K2CO3, which was also confirmed by other researches. Furthermore, the EDS spectra of KNN powders after twice ball milling are presented in. Although there is still composition heterogeneity between K and Na, the K/Na ratios are close to 1:1, especially when the calcination temperature enhances up to 900 \xb0C. It can be noted that a fraction of abnormal large particle clusters exists (>5 \u03bcm) along with aggregated fine particles (\u223c1 \u03bcm) in powders mixture without twice ball milling, when the calcination temperature is higher than 900 \xb0C. Particularly, as the calcination temperature increases to 950 \xb0C, the formation of particle clusters and serious agglomeration phenomenon exists in 950-1st powder , associating with the slightly decreased AGS, which could be caused by inhomogeneous stress distribution by increasing calcination temperatures. Besides, compared with powder calcined at 900 \xb0C, the formation rate and number of crystal nucleus could be increased when the calcination temperature increases to 950 \xb0C, which induces the competition among crystal nucleus being more serious, thus, the particle size of 950-1st and 950-2nd slightly decreases. Herein, the bimodal particle size distribution in calcined powders is referred as irregular grain growth behavior, which can easily cause abnormal grain growth (AGG) in bulk ceramics. Note ball milling can successfully destroy particle clusters, and the agglomeration phenomenon is alleviated after twice ball milling in KNN-based calcined powder, meanwhile the maximum grain size decreases. The morphology of calcined powders exhibits relatively uniform average grain size (AGS) after twice ball milling, and the chemical heterogeneity is relieved to a certain extent , owing to the increased pressures of the collisions and destruction of abnormal particle clusters after the ball milling. Besides, after twice ball milling, the largest AGS is obtained in 900-2nd powders , and the modification of particle size and distribution of powder mixtures may affect size-dependent grain growth in the final two-step sintering process. is XRD diffraction patterns of as-sintered ceramics, which demonstrate that CZ ceramics with different calcination temperatures under both once or twice ball milling obtain a pure perovskite phase structure, indicating ternary components are dissolved into the lattice to form a pure solid solution. All samples display splitting {200}PC diffraction peaks ((a)), suggesting that the phase structure KNN-BNZ system can be well remained under different preparation processes. Additionally, to confirm the phase evolution as a function of different preparation processes, the refined XRD data of {200} re\ufb02ection peaks fitted via the Gauss-Lorentz function are presented in (b\u2013e). One can see that the polymorphic boundary is retained in all ceramics, and all CZ ceramics prepared by different processes exhibit similar rhombohedral-tetragonal (R-T) phase coexistence, which is consistent with other researches. Additionally, the content of tetragonal (T) and rhombohedral (R) phases in different processes is also collected in the inset of (b\u2013e), while more content of the T phase can be observed regardless of improving calcination temperatures or undergone secondary ball milling. It was reported that the content of T phase a\ufb00ected the piezoelectricity of piezoceramics, while larger piezoelectricity could be observed in the ceramics with higher content of T phase. As presented in , based on R-T multiphase coexistence, the refined fitting of diffraction {110} peaks show that the NaNbO3-like and KNbO3-like heterogeneity grains have almost disappeared in final two-step sintering, indicating chemical homogeneity is basically realized in final high temperature sintering process. On one hand, it is reported that both K-rich and Na-rich KNN grains can grow rapidly and their diffusion mechanisms are activated when the calcination temperature is over 1000 \xb0C. Therefore, K-rich and Na-rich KNN can inter-diffuse and KNN matrix with a K/Na ratio of approximately 1:1 is expected. On the other hand, if an effective homogenization is obtained in KNN-based ceramics on the basis of multi-ferroelectric phase coexistence during the final sintering process, the preferable piezoelectric properties will be mostly expected (discussed in the following text). To further determine the composition homogeneity of bulk ceramics under different preparation processes, EDS spectra near both larger and smaller grains of bulk ceramics are presented in. Compared with composition heterogeneity in calcined powders , the K/Na ratio is approximately 1:1 in bulk ceramics under final high temperature sintering, indicating high efficiency homogenization of KNN-based ceramics under elevated temperature (>1100 \xb0C). However, although no obvious enrichment of NaNbO3-like and KNbO3-like heterogeneity grains is observed in {100} re\ufb02ection peaks , owing to limitations in measurement precision of XRD, slight A-site inhomogeneity are observed in EDS spectra of bulk ceramics without twice ball milling ((a and b)). On the other hand, previous researches have concluded that the chemical heterogeneity of KNN can be homogenized by repeated calcination , but since there is a significant compositional difference between K-rich and Na-rich KNN in pre-calcinated powders, the homogenization of these particles can still occur but with a limited efficiency in elevated sintering temperature, which consequently induces KNN-based bulk ceramics with a slight fluctuation K/Na ratio distribution. Both K-rich and Na-rich types of KNN grains can grow rapidly and diffuse to each other at final sintering process owing to that the mass diffusion is activated , and thus, compared with bimodal-like un-uniform particle size distribution in calcined powders , almost unimodal-like grain size distributions are observed in bulk ceramics. Besides, photos of CZ samples under different preparation processes show slight color differences , yet all have high densification (>95 %) under different sintering conditions. To quantitative evaluate the uniformity of grain distribution, standard deviation (\u03c3) based on statistical analysis of grain size distribution in buck ceramics after final sintering is exhibited in. Particularly, compared with ceramics in group A ((a\u2013d)), the abnormal grain growth behavior in bulk ceramics is greatly suppressed after twice ball milling in group B ((e\u2013h)), associated with gradually decrease in AGS  and significant reduction in \u03c3 of grain size , indicating more uniform grain size distribution is realized in group B. According to research by Malic et al., Na2CO3 decomposes and reacts with B-site oxide (e.g., Nb2O5, ZrO2) more easily than K2CO3, and possesses a higher diffusion reactivity rate, inducing abnormal heterogeneous grain growth in final sintering process. Thus, owing to more serious chemical heterogeneity of calcined powders in group A, heterogeneous KNN can form recrystallized seeds in the first stage, and sustainable growth in the second stage during TSS, followed by the homogenization process. Consequently, an amount of abnormal coarse grains (\u223c10\u201314 \u03bcm) is observed in 800-1st and 850-1st ((a and b)), and this phenomenon has been alleviated with the appropriate improvement of chemical homogeneity by enhancing calcination temperature and twice ball-milling. Additionally, one can see that appropriate sintering temperature can promote homogenization, and increase AGS, while the maximum value of AGS in groups A&B can be obtained at 900-1st and 900-2nd, respectively, and the slightly increased grain size in each group could promote the domain switching, inducing the enhanced piezoelectric properties. We measured variations of d33 and kp of ceramics under different preparation processes ( ). Particularly, compared with ceramics in group A, d33 and kp are greatly improved after twice ball milling in group B, exhibiting a trend akin to the changes of standard deviation analysis of grain size distribution in bulk ceramics. Meanwhile, the \u03b8max in frequency-dependent impedance spectra represents poling efficiency, while an ideal polarization effect can be realized when \u03b8 reaches nearly 90\xb0. Notably, the \u03b8max in group B significantly increases compared with ceramics in group A , indicating that more efficient domain switching and higher polarization efficiency are obtained in uniform grain size distribution. Besides, an interesting phenomenon is that ceramics with a calcination temperature of 900 \xb0C (i.e., 900-1st, 900-2nd) have achieved better piezoelectric properties in each group. Specifically, the maximum d33 value of 368 pC/N is obtained in the CZ-doped sample in group B, as well as an excellent kp value (kp = 0.52). To further elucidate the underlying mechanism of the enormous difference in piezoelectric properties within group A and group B, temperature-dependent permittivity curves and in-situ temperature-dependent d33 of CZ ceramics calcined at 900 \xb0C with better piezoelectric properties in each group are investigated. As shown in , in addition to the relatively sharp peak corresponding to Curie temperature (TC), only one weak diffused bump related to the complex ferroelectric phase boundaries is observed, which agrees well with the polymorphic phase structure of the KNN-BNZ system. Correspondingly, note that the small signal d33 variation with temperature determined by in situ d33 curves also follows a similar tendency, where d33 increases slowly and forms a weak diffused bump near ambient temperature , which is also related to the complex ferroelectric phase transition. Besides, TC is also dependent on grain uniformity and chemical homogeneity, and it will slightly fluctuate among different preparation processes. Meanwhile, d33 of ceramics in each group decreases continuously with increasing temperature, gradually reaching 0 pC/N slightly below TC, and exhibit similar in situ depolarization behaviors. As presented in , the ferroelectric hysteresis loops become more saturated in group B, following with a slight enhancement of remanent polarization (Pr), indicating that the significant enhancement of the switching ability of the non-180\xb0 ferroelectric domain during polarization. Meanwhile, the maximum polarization (Pmax), bipolar and unipolar electrostrains (S), and switching current (I) also increase in group B, indicating an obvious synchronous enhancement of both intrinsic piezoelectric response and extrinsic domain switching during polarization, which is consistent with the variation trend of \u03b8max in frequency-dependent impedance spectra. The aforementioned results demonstrate that chemical inhomogeneity is extensively present in the calcined KNN-based powders, which is believed to be an origin of the distinct grain growth behavior and different piezoelectric properties in group A and group B under the same final TSS process. Besides, chemical modification, especially multicomponent co-doping strategy, has been the most important strategy for enhancing the piezoelectric properties of KNN-based ceramic. Additionally, multiple dopants (or modifiers) would be added to the KNN systems simultaneously, which inevitably induces the chemical reaction among reactants becoming highly competitive. The 900-2nd KNN powders with better chemical homogeneity and KNbO3 powders, were pressed by cold isostatic pressure to form green discs, respectively. Then, they were pressed into a laminated structure with 10 mm in according to the mass ratio of 1:1, and sintered using TSS technique under the same sintering conditions. XRD profiles indicate that perovskite structure has been synthesized in both KNN-based and KNbO3 ceramics after the final TSS sintering. It can be seen from that KNN (900-2nd) and KNbO3 can be well combined after final sintering, and a clear mesoscopic interface is observed between them. Notably, an interesting phenomenon is that the Na-rich phase appears around interface of two systems and inside the region of KNbO3 bulk ceramic, while segregation of K is not observed on the side of KNN. Additionally, line scanning EDS spectra of laminated structure shows a significant difference in content of K between KNN (900-2nd) and KNbO3 on both sides of the interface, and Na content in KNbO3 region even increases as moving away from the interface. Therefore, different diffusion rates of A-site ions (KE^{+} or NaE^{+}) is one of the reasons for chemical inhomogeneity, inducing chemical competition in solid-state synthesis process being more extreme. Meanwhile, it has been extensively reported that Nb2O5/ZrO2 tend to react more easily with Na2CO3 than K2CO3, owing to Na2CO3 obtaining higher reactivity and diffusion coefficient. Therefore, NaNbO3-like grains can grow rapidly into an enormous size and consume most of the surface driving force in the calcination process. Consequently, the grain growth of KNbO3-like grains will be inhibited to a certain extent, inducing diffusion kinetics to be unbalanced in calcination process, which will affect the non-uniform grain growth behavior and homogenization efficiency in the final sintering process. As presented in (a), twice ball-milling is beneficial to reduce grain size differences and obtain more homogeneous calcined powders, inducing diffusion kinetics of NaNbO3-like and KNbO3-like particles reaches consistent. Thus, it will promote uniformity of mixing and chemically homogenous of the green powder , which accelerates heterogeneous particles with smaller grain size difference easily to form recrystallized seeds in the first stage of TSS. In the second stage, the ceramics are rapidly cooled to a lower temperature, promoting the mutual diffusion of grain boundaries easily under the effect of capillary forces, inducing uniform grain growth behavior, and inducing the K/Na ratio in final KNN products close to 1 , which facilitates homogenization process in final sintering process. Consequently, the uniform grain size distribution and preferable chemical homogeneity can be obtained by regulating processing parameters (i.e., systematical modulate the calcination temperature and subsequent ball milling treatment) in synthesis process of multicomponent co-doping KNN systems.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The XRD patterns of KNN powders calcined at different temperatures are shown in , which indicates that a perovskite structure has been obtained after calcination of all powders. The extensive researches have argued that the reactions of alkali carbonates and niobium pentoxide will be between 300 \xb0C to 700 \xb0C, and a pure perovskite structure could be constructed when the temperature is higher than 700 \xb0C. In our case, apart from expected KNN perovskite peaks, the shoulder distributed at a higher angle of each diffraction peak are observed in all powders (black arrow), which can be indexed to NaNbO3 (NN) (PDF#01-071-0947). Therefore, the coexistence of multiple phases indicated by the splitting of multiple diffraction peaks in all powder mixtures suggests the chemical inhomogeneity of A-site elements in KNN perovskite. To clearly characterize the chemical inhomogeneity of calcined powder, the refined {110} peak fitted via the Gauss-Lorentz function according to diffraction peaks of NaNbO3 (NN) (PDF#01-071-0947, red index line) and KNbO3 (KN) (PDF#01-071-0947, light blue index line) are presented in. According to the PDF card, three fitting peaks from left to right correspond to KNbO3, K-rich KNN, and NaNbO3, respectively. Meanwhile, KNbO3 almost diminishes after increasing the calcination temperature up to 900 \xb0C. Additionally, after second ball milling, the diffraction peak of KNbO3 almost disappears while the diffraction peak of NaNbO3 is weakened, especially under the condition that the calcination temperature is enhanced up to 900 \xb0C ((g and h)). In order to further determine the composition heterogeneity of different powders, EDS elemental analysis of powders calcined at different temperatures after once and twice ball milling is presented in , respectively. To accurately characterize the chemical heterogeneity, EDS spectra near both larger and smaller particles are tested to semiquantitatively determine element content. Meanwhile, most particles are mainly Na-rich phase, and only a slight of K-rich phase is detected , owing to that Na2CO3 has higher reactivity to react with Nb2O5/ZrO2 than K2CO3, which was also confirmed by other researches. Furthermore, the EDS spectra of KNN powders after twice ball milling are presented in. Although there is still composition heterogeneity between K and Na, the K/Na ratios are close to 1:1, especially when the calcination temperature enhances up to 900 \xb0C. It can be noted that a fraction of abnormal large particle clusters exists (>5 \u03bcm) along with aggregated fine particles (\u223c1 \u03bcm) in powders mixture without twice ball milling, when the calcination temperature is higher than 900 \xb0C. Particularly, as the calcination temperature increases to 950 \xb0C, the formation of particle clusters and serious agglomeration phenomenon exists in 950-1st powder , associating with the slightly decreased AGS, which could be caused by inhomogeneous stress distribution by increasing calcination temperatures. Besides, compared with powder calcined at 900 \xb0C, the formation rate and number of crystal nucleus could be increased when the calcination temperature increases to 950 \xb0C, which induces the competition among crystal nucleus being more serious, thus, the particle size of 950-1st and 950-2nd slightly decreases. Herein, the bimodal particle size distribution in calcined powders is referred as irregular grain growth behavior, which can easily cause abnormal grain growth (AGG) in bulk ceramics. Note ball milling can successfully destroy particle clusters, and the agglomeration phenomenon is alleviated after twice ball milling in KNN-based calcined powder, meanwhile the maximum grain size decreases. The morphology of calcined powders exhibits relatively uniform average grain size (AGS) after twice ball milling, and the chemical heterogeneity is relieved to a certain extent , owing to the increased pressures of the collisions and destruction of abnormal particle clusters after the ball milling. Besides, after twice ball milling, the largest AGS is obtained in 900-2nd powders , and the modification of particle size and distribution of powder mixtures may affect size-dependent grain growth in the final two-step sintering process. is XRD diffraction patterns of as-sintered ceramics, which demonstrate that CZ ceramics with different calcination temperatures under both once or twice ball milling obtain a pure perovskite phase structure, indicating ternary components are dissolved into the lattice to form a pure solid solution. All samples display splitting {200}PC diffraction peaks ((a)), suggesting that the phase structure KNN-BNZ system can be well remained under different preparation processes. Additionally, to confirm the phase evolution as a function of different preparation processes, the refined XRD data of {200} re\ufb02ection peaks fitted via the Gauss-Lorentz function are presented in (b\u2013e). One can see that the polymorphic boundary is retained in all ceramics, and all CZ ceramics prepared by different processes exhibit similar rhombohedral-tetragonal (R-T) phase coexistence, which is consistent with other researches. Additionally, the content of tetragonal (T) and rhombohedral (R) phases in different processes is also collected in the inset of (b\u2013e), while more content of the T phase can be observed regardless of improving calcination temperatures or undergone secondary ball milling. It was reported that the content of T phase a\ufb00ected the piezoelectricity of piezoceramics, while larger piezoelectricity could be observed in the ceramics with higher content of T phase. As presented in , based on R-T multiphase coexistence, the refined fitting of diffraction {110} peaks show that the NaNbO3-like and KNbO3-like heterogeneity grains have almost disappeared in final two-step sintering, indicating chemical homogeneity is basically realized in final high temperature sintering process. On one hand, it is reported that both K-rich and Na-rich KNN grains can grow rapidly and their diffusion mechanisms are activated when the calcination temperature is over 1000 \xb0C. Therefore, K-rich and Na-rich KNN can inter-diffuse and KNN matrix with a K/Na ratio of approximately 1:1 is expected. On the other hand, if an effective homogenization is obtained in KNN-based ceramics on the basis of multi-ferroelectric phase coexistence during the final sintering process, the preferable piezoelectric properties will be mostly expected (discussed in the following text). To further determine the composition homogeneity of bulk ceramics under different preparation processes, EDS spectra near both larger and smaller grains of bulk ceramics are presented in. Compared with composition heterogeneity in calcined powders , the K/Na ratio is approximately 1:1 in bulk ceramics under final high temperature sintering, indicating high efficiency homogenization of KNN-based ceramics under elevated temperature (>1100 \xb0C). However, although no obvious enrichment of NaNbO3-like and KNbO3-like heterogeneity grains is observed in {100} re\ufb02ection peaks , owing to limitations in measurement precision of XRD, slight A-site inhomogeneity are observed in EDS spectra of bulk ceramics without twice ball milling ((a and b)). On the other hand, previous researches have concluded that the chemical heterogeneity of KNN can be homogenized by repeated calcination , but since there is a significant compositional difference between K-rich and Na-rich KNN in pre-calcinated powders, the homogenization of these particles can still occur but with a limited efficiency in elevated sintering temperature, which consequently induces KNN-based bulk ceramics with a slight fluctuation K/Na ratio distribution. Both K-rich and Na-rich types of KNN grains can grow rapidly and diffuse to each other at final sintering process owing to that the mass diffusion is activated , and thus, compared with bimodal-like un-uniform particle size distribution in calcined powders , almost unimodal-like grain size distributions are observed in bulk ceramics. Besides, photos of CZ samples under different preparation processes show slight color differences , yet all have high densification (>95 %) under different sintering conditions. To quantitative evaluate the uniformity of grain distribution, standard deviation (\u03c3) based on statistical analysis of grain size distribution in buck ceramics after final sintering is exhibited in. Particularly, compared with ceramics in group A ((a\u2013d)), the abnormal grain growth behavior in bulk ceramics is greatly suppressed after twice ball milling in group B ((e\u2013h)), associated with gradually decrease in AGS  and significant reduction in \u03c3 of grain size , indicating more uniform grain size distribution is realized in group B. According to research by Malic et al., Na2CO3 decomposes and reacts with B-site oxide (e.g., Nb2O5, ZrO2) more easily than K2CO3, and possesses a higher diffusion reactivity rate, inducing abnormal heterogeneous grain growth in final sintering process. Thus, owing to more serious chemical heterogeneity of calcined powders in group A, heterogeneous KNN can form recrystallized seeds in the first stage, and sustainable growth in the second stage during TSS, followed by the homogenization process. Consequently, an amount of abnormal coarse grains (\u223c10\u201314 \u03bcm) is observed in 800-1st and 850-1st ((a and b)), and this phenomenon has been alleviated with the appropriate improvement of chemical homogeneity by enhancing calcination temperature and twice ball-milling. Additionally, one can see that appropriate sintering temperature can promote homogenization, and increase AGS, while the maximum value of AGS in groups A&B can be obtained at 900-1st and 900-2nd, respectively, and the slightly increased grain size in each group could promote the domain switching, inducing the enhanced piezoelectric properties. We measured variations of d33 and kp of ceramics under different preparation processes ( ). Particularly, compared with ceramics in group A, d33 and kp are greatly improved after twice ball milling in group B, exhibiting a trend akin to the changes of standard deviation analysis of grain size distribution in bulk ceramics. Meanwhile, the \u03b8max in frequency-dependent impedance spectra represents poling efficiency, while an ideal polarization effect can be realized when \u03b8 reaches nearly 90\xb0. Notably, the \u03b8max in group B significantly increases compared with ceramics in group A , indicating that more efficient domain switching and higher polarization efficiency are obtained in uniform grain size distribution. Besides, an interesting phenomenon is that ceramics with a calcination temperature of 900 \xb0C (i.e., 900-1st, 900-2nd) have achieved better piezoelectric properties in each group. Specifically, the maximum d33 value of 368 pC/N is obtained in the CZ-doped sample in group B, as well as an excellent kp value (kp = 0.52). To further elucidate the underlying mechanism of the enormous difference in piezoelectric properties within group A and group B, temperature-dependent permittivity curves and in-situ temperature-dependent d33 of CZ ceramics calcined at 900 \xb0C with better piezoelectric properties in each group are investigated. As shown in , in addition to the relatively sharp peak corresponding to Curie temperature (TC), only one weak diffused bump related to the complex ferroelectric phase boundaries is observed, which agrees well with the polymorphic phase structure of the KNN-BNZ system. Correspondingly, note that the small signal d33 variation with temperature determined by in situ d33 curves also follows a similar tendency, where d33 increases slowly and forms a weak diffused bump near ambient temperature , which is also related to the complex ferroelectric phase transition. Besides, TC is also dependent on grain uniformity and chemical homogeneity, and it will slightly fluctuate among different preparation processes. Meanwhile, d33 of ceramics in each group decreases continuously with increasing temperature, gradually reaching 0 pC/N slightly below TC, and exhibit similar in situ depolarization behaviors. As presented in , the ferroelectric hysteresis loops become more saturated in group B, following with a slight enhancement of remanent polarization (Pr), indicating that the significant enhancement of the switching ability of the non-180\xb0 ferroelectric domain during polarization. Meanwhile, the maximum polarization (Pmax), bipolar and unipolar electrostrains (S), and switching current (I) also increase in group B, indicating an obvious synchronous enhancement of both intrinsic piezoelectric response and extrinsic domain switching during polarization, which is consistent with the variation trend of \u03b8max in frequency-dependent impedance spectra. The aforementioned results demonstrate that chemical inhomogeneity is extensively present in the calcined KNN-based powders, which is believed to be an origin of the distinct grain growth behavior and different piezoelectric properties in group A and group B under the same final TSS process. Besides, chemical modification, especially multicomponent co-doping strategy, has been the most important strategy for enhancing the piezoelectric properties of KNN-based ceramic. Additionally, multiple dopants (or modifiers) would be added to the KNN systems simultaneously, which inevitably induces the chemical reaction among reactants becoming highly competitive. The 900-2nd KNN powders with better chemical homogeneity and KNbO3 powders, were pressed by cold isostatic pressure to form green discs, respectively. Then, they were pressed into a laminated structure with 10 mm in according to the mass ratio of 1:1, and sintered using TSS technique under the same sintering conditions. XRD profiles indicate that perovskite structure has been synthesized in both KNN-based and KNbO3 ceramics after the final TSS sintering. It can be seen from that KNN (900-2nd) and KNbO3 can be well combined after final sintering, and a clear mesoscopic interface is observed between them. Notably, an interesting phenomenon is that the Na-rich phase appears around interface of two systems and inside the region of KNbO3 bulk ceramic, while segregation of K is not observed on the side of KNN. Additionally, line scanning EDS spectra of laminated structure shows a significant difference in content of K between KNN (900-2nd) and KNbO3 on both sides of the interface, and Na content in KNbO3 region even increases as moving away from the interface. Therefore, different diffusion rates of A-site ions (KE^{+} or NaE^{+}) is one of the reasons for chemical inhomogeneity, inducing chemical competition in solid-state synthesis process being more extreme. Meanwhile, it has been extensively reported that Nb2O5/ZrO2 tend to react more easily with Na2CO3 than K2CO3, owing to Na2CO3 obtaining higher reactivity and diffusion coefficient. Therefore, NaNbO3-like grains can grow rapidly into an enormous size and consume most of the surface driving force in the calcination process. Consequently, the grain growth of KNbO3-like grains will be inhibited to a certain extent, inducing diffusion kinetics to be unbalanced in calcination process, which will affect the non-uniform grain growth behavior and homogenization efficiency in the final sintering process. As presented in (a), twice ball-milling is beneficial to reduce grain size differences and obtain more homogeneous calcined powders, inducing diffusion kinetics of NaNbO3-like and KNbO3-like particles reaches consistent. Thus, it will promote uniformity of mixing and chemically homogenous of the green powder , which accelerates heterogeneous particles with smaller grain size difference easily to form recrystallized seeds in the first stage of TSS. In the second stage, the ceramics are rapidly cooled to a lower temperature, promoting the mutual diffusion of grain boundaries easily under the effect of capillary forces, inducing uniform grain growth behavior, and inducing the K/Na ratio in final KNN products close to 1 , which facilitates homogenization process in final sintering process. Consequently, the uniform grain size distribution and preferable chemical homogeneity can be obtained by regulating processing parameters (i.e., systematical modulate the calcination temperature and subsequent ball milling treatment) in synthesis process of multicomponent co-doping KNN systems.
