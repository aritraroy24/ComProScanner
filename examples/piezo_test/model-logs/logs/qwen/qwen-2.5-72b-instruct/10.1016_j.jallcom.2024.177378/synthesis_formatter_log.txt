Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'columbite precursor method', 'precursors': ['ZnO', 'Nb2O5', 'Pb3O4', 'HfO2', 'TiO2'], 'steps': ['ZnO and Nb2O5 were used to synthesize ZnNb2O6 precursor at 1000 °C.', 'The mixture of ZnNb2O6 with Pb3O4, HfO2, and TiO2 was ball milled.', 'The ball milled mixture was calcined at 850 °C for 2 h.', 'The calcined mixture was pressed.', 'The pressed mixture was sintered at 1050 °C for 2 h to form the corresponding ceramics.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['SEM', 'XRD', 'quasi-static d33 tester', 'digital bridge', 'ferroelectric test system', 'impedance analyzer']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
