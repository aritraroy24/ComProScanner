Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same.

**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'spin-coating', 'precursors': ['P(VDF-TrFE)', 'NBT-0.6CeO2', 'diethyl carbonate (DEC)'], 'steps': ['NBT-0.6CeO2 (0.05–0.25 vol%) was dispersed in a P(VDF-TrFE) matrix using 10 wt% DEC solvent to prepare the composite.', 'Thin films (0.8–1 µm thickness, depending on filler concentration) were fabricated by spin-coating onto glass substrates pre-coated with aluminum electrodes.', 'A metal-insulator-metal (MIM) structure was formed by depositing additional aluminum electrodes onto the spin-coated films.', 'Samples were annealed at 100°C to optimize crystallinity.', 'Bulk samples for piezoelectric measurements were prepared by solution casting method (thickness of 30 µm).'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'FTIR', 'FESEM', 'Impedance Analyzer', 'LC Analyzer', 'Electrometer', 'd33 meter']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
