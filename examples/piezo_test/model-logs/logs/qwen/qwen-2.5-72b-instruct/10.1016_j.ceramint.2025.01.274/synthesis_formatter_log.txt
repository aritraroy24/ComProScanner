**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'Solid-state reaction', 'precursors': ['Pb3O4', 'SrCO3', 'MgO', 'Nb2O5', 'TiO2', 'ZrO2', 'MnCO3'], 'steps': ['The raw materials were mixed according to the stoichiometric ratio and accurately weighed.', 'The mixture was ball milled for 18 h.', 'The dried powder was calcined at 850 °C for 3 h.', 'MnCO3 was added and the mixture was ball-milled for 18 h.', 'Polyvinyl butyral was used as a binder to press the dried powder into disks with a diameter of 10 mm.', 'The green discs were heated to remove organics at 600 °C for 3 h.', 'The green discs were sintered at 1150–1250 °C for 3 h.', 'Both sides of the sintered circular samples were coated with silver electrodes and held at 550 °C for 30 min.', 'The ceramics were polarized in a 150 °C silicone oil with a direct current electric field of 3 kV/mm for 35 min.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'SEM', 'LCR meter', 'Ferroelectric test system', 'XPS', 'Impedance analyzer']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
