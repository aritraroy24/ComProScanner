Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.

**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
