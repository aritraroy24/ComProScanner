The PSN-PMN-PT ternary ceramics were prepared via the solid state reaction method. MgO (99.9 %), Sc2O3 (99.99 %) and Nb2O5 (99.5 %) were used to synthesize the precursors MgNb2O6 (fabricated at 1000 \xb0C) and ScNbO4 (fabricated at 1150 \xb0C). The MgNb2O6, ScNbO4, TiO2 (98 %) and PbO (99.99 %) powders were selected and weighed in accordance with the stoichiometric proportion and 2 mol% PbO extra was added to make up for the vaporization of PbO during sintering. After that, alcohol and the above oxide powders were mixed in a 1:1 ratio by wet-milling for 24 h. Next, the combined powder was subjected to calcination at 800 \u2212 850 \xb0C for 2 h, the calcined mixture was mixed again for 12 h. Subsequently, the powder was conglutinated with a solution of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and pressed into tablets under 8 MPa, and then the PVA was burned off at 550 \xb0C for a duration of 2 h. Finally, the ceramic tablets were covered by powders with the same composition to maintain a Pb-rich atmosphere and sintered at 1200 \u2212 1280 \xb0C for 4 h. The polished samples (cylindrical disks with diameters of 11.40 \u2013 11.54 mm and thickness of 0.74 \u2013 0.90 mm) were coated with sliver electrodes on both sides in preparation for electrical tests. The poling temperature, duration and electric field are 130 \xb0C, 15 min and 30 kV/cm, respectively. The phase structure and morphology of the samples were examined by X-ray diffraction (Bruker D2 PHASER Gen2, Germany) and scanning electron microscope (TESCAN, VEGA II XMU, Czechia), respectively. The d 33 was tested by a quasi-static piezoelectric meter (ZJ-6A, China). For poled samples, a LCR meter (Agilent E4980A, USA) was used to test the dielectric permittivity (\u03b5 r) and loss (tan\u03b4) as a function of temperature from 30 to 300 \xb0C. The ferroelectric polarization hysteresis behaviors (P \u2212 E) were obtained by a ferroelectric test system (aixACCTTF Analyzer 2000, Germany). With the use of impedance analyzer (Agilent 4294 A, USA), the electromechanical coupling factor k p was tested. The thermal stimulated depolarization current was measured by standard short circuit approach through Keithley 6487. The temperature stability of d 33 was measured using the length-extensional mode of k 33 piezoelectric resonator via resonant method, the detailed experimental process is shown in Note S1. The 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT ceramic with the highest piezoelectric performance was used as piezoelectric elements to prepare ultrasonic transducer.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
displays the XRD patterns of xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics. Each sample is of pure perovskite structure without pyrochlore phase, which implies that PSN and PMN-PT have successfully formed a solid solution. For PT-based ferroelectric systems, the change of the phase structure can generally be reflected through the diffraction peak of (200) around 45\xb0. (b), (d), (f) and (h) depict the evolution of (200) diffraction peak with the variable composition. It is evident that with the increasing PT content, the same variation trend of the (200) peak is observed for PSN-PMN-PT samples with different x (x = 0.06, 0.15, 0.29, and 0.43). Taking the x = 0.15 ceramics as an example, when the PT content is less than 0.35 mol (y < 0.35), the (200) diffraction peak is single and the crystalline structure of these compositions is dominated by rhombohedral phase. As y increases to 0.35, the (200) peak starts to broaden, indicating that the phase transition begins in this component. When y further increases, a shoulder on the left side of the (200) peak occurs and its relative intensity gradually increases. As y rises to 0.40, the (200) peak almost splits into (200) and (002), suggesting that the tetragonal phase is dominant. For PT-based ferroelectric ceramics, grain size is one of the key factors affecting their electric properties, because the grain size determines the domain size, which is closely related to electric properties. As an example, presents the surface SEM images of the 0.15PSN-(0.85 \u2212 y)PMN-yPT, and illustrate the corresponding grain size distribution. The bulk density of these ceramics varies between 7.5 and 7.85 g/cmE^{3}, and the relative densities are greater than 95 %. According to the grain size distribution in , it has been observed that the mean grain size for all 0.15PSN-(0.85 \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics varies within a small range of 1.9 \u2212 2.38 \u03bcm, indicating the influence of grain size on the electric performances of x = 0.15 ceramics with different PT content can be ignored. This conclusion also applies to x = 0.06, 0.29, and 0.43 ceramics with different PT content in this study. To further determine the composition-induced phase transition behaviors of the PSN-PMN-PT ceramics, the fitting of the XRD patterns of x = 0.15 ceramics were fitted using the Rietveld refinement , the refined results are presented in and. The optimal Rietveld refinement results are achieved for all x = 0.15 ceramics by using the following phase models: R3m + Pm (R + MC) for y = 0.32 \u2212 0.33, R3m + Pm + Cm (R + Mc + MA) for y = 0.34, and P4mm + Pm (T + MC) for y = 0.35 \u2212 0.40, demonstrating that multi-phases with competing symmetries coexist in the PSN-PMN-PT system. The detailed phase volume fractions of all x = 0.15 ceramics based on the refined results is exhibited in. Clearly, in the ceramics with y = 0.32 and 0.33, the R and MC phases coexist and MC phase is dominant, and the MC phase fraction is 72 % and 89 %, respectively. For y = 0.34 ceramic, the three-phase coexistence of MC, MA and R is observed, with volume fractions of 84 %, 6 % and 10 %, respectively. When the y exceeds 0.34, R and MA phases disappear, and the samples show the two-phase coexistence of MC and T. Moreover, as the y rises from 0.35 to 0.40, the T phase fraction progressively increased from 20 % to 70 % and the MC phase fraction decreased from 80 % to 30 %. The results of the phase fraction for x = 0.15 ceramics are consistent with the analysis in (b) and are also in agreement with the phase diagram. Previous studies have confirmed that the 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT ceramic consists of a combination of MC (21.19 %) and T (78.81 %) phases and T phase is dominant, implying that similar trend of phase fraction with increased PT content should be obtained in x = 0.06, 0.29 and 0.43 components. The multi-phases coexistence is an intrinsic feature in PSN-PMN-PT system, which is in good agreement with the observations in other PT-based ferroelectrics. The variations of the dielectric permittivity \u03b5 r and dielectric loss factor tan\u03b4 for poled xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics with temperature in the range of 30 \u2013 300 \xb0C are illustrated in (a)-(d). All measurements of the curves are measured at a frequency of 1 kHz. As can be observed, for x = 0.06, 0.15, 0.29 and 0.43 ceramics with low PT content, the presence of two distinct dielectric anomalous peaks is observed, corresponding to the phase transition of ferroelectric-ferroelectric (F-F) and ferroelectric-paraelectric (F-P), respectively. With the increasing PT content, the dielectric anomalous peak associated with F-F phase transition (at low temperature T f-f) gradually weakens and only a single dielectric anomalous peak connected with F-P phase transition (at high temperature T c) is obviously observed. The visual phase transition temperatures T f-f and T c for all xPSN-(1 \u2013 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT samples are depicted in (e). In all ceramics with the same x, the T f-f decreases while T c increases with increasing PT content, which can be ascribed to gradually increased tetragonal phase fraction, since the PT is of tetragonal phase as well as a high T c of 490 \xb0C. Besides, the observation indicates that, for the ceramics with the same PT content, the PSN-PMN-PT system exhibits an increase in both T f-f and T c as the PSN content increases, which results from the larger rhombohedral lattice deformation and higher T c of PSN in comparison with PMN. It should be noted that the tan\u03b4 of all ceramics is less than 0.05 in the whole test temperature range. Additionally, as the PT content increases, the dielectric anomaly peak connected with F-P phase transition in x = 0.06, 0.15, 0.29 and 0.43 ceramics gradually become narrow, indicating the relaxation behavior gradually weakens. Such dielectric relaxor behavior can be demonstrated by the modified Curie-Weiss law of 1/\u025b \u2212 1/\u025b max = (T \u2212 T max)E^{ }/C, where C represents the Curie-Weiss constant, and \u03b3 represents the diffusion coefficient, and \u025b max and T max refer to the maximum dielectric constant and the corresponding temperature, respectively. The fitting results of the representative 0.15PSN-(0.85 \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics are as depicted in (f). The calculated \u03b3 value decreases from 1.79 for y = 0.32 to 1.58 for y = 0.40 ceramics, which can be put down to the reason that PT is a classical ferroelectric. In the meantime, the high \u03b3 signifies the strong relaxor characteristics of the PSN-PMN-PT system, which can be attributed to the intensified ionic disorder and local charge mismatch at B site. (a) shows the variation trend of relative permittivity \u03b5 r of all components. As the PT content increases, the trend of \u03b5 r can be observed to exhibit an initial increase followed by a subsequent decrease in each special x. The maximum value is obtained near y = 0.35, 0.38, 0.39 and 0.41, respectively, for x = 0.06, 0.15, 0.29 and 0.43 ceramics. In combination with XRD analysis, these samples have the two-phase coexistence of T + MC and the T phase is dominant. The polarization-electric field (P \u2212 E) loops of xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT samples under a 20 kV/cm electric field are depicted in. The presence of well-shaped hysteresis loops with saturation in all samples clearly indicates their well ferroelectricity. (b) displays the remanent polarization P r and coercive electric field E c of the xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics. As y increases for each x, it is evident that the values of P r slightly fluctuate around 30 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, while the E c values gradually increase due to the increase of T phase fraction. For piezoelectric materials, piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) is commonly regarded as a crucial parameter that signifies the capacity to transform external force into charge. In general, the d 33 exhibits a direct correlation with the ferroelectric polarization and dielectric characteristics of piezoelectric ceramics. The equation of d 33\u221d \u03b5 r P r can be used to establish the relationships among them. (c) and (d) present the \u025b r P r and d 33 of xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics. It is evident that as PT content increases, both d 33 and \u025b r P r exhibit a similar tendency of initial increase followed by decrease, suggesting the improvement of d 33 is indeed resulted from the enhanced \u025b r P r. The maximum d 33 value for each x occurs at 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT samples and the corresponding value is 665, 620, 585, and 650 pC/N, respectively. It should be pointed out that the high d 33 for these ceramics mainly originates from enhanced \u025b r instead of P r, since the P r only presents a slight change. Combining the Rietveld refinement results of x = 0.15, it can be inferred that the high d 33 obtained at y = 0.36, 0.37 mainly results from the easy polarization rotation induced by external electric field owing to the appropriate phase fraction of T + MC. As the PT content is further increased, d 33 shows a marked decrease. Combining the refinement results, the decrease of d 33 can be attributed to the further increasing fraction of the tetragonal phase proportion, because the domain switching gets harder. Moreover, as the x increases, the component with the highest d 33 shifts to the region with higher PT content, which is due to the larger rhombohedral lattice deformation of PSN. The k p shows a similar trend to that of d 33, which exhibits an initial increase followed by a subsequent decrease as the y increases, and the k p value can reach up to 0.67, as depicted in. lists the detailed d 33 and k p values for each ceramic. The piezoelectric performances of piezoceramics are subject to temperature variation due to the thermal depolarization. presents the temperature-dependent pyroelectric current density for the poled 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT ceramics. We can obviously see that each sample exhibits two current density peaks and the corresponding temperatures are 70 \xb0C and 181 \xb0C for 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 75 \xb0C and 200 \xb0C for 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 75 \xb0C and 226 \xb0C for 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT, 68 \xb0C and 248 \xb0C for 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT samples. These temperatures are almost in agreement with their T f-f and T c obtained from \u025b r \u2212 T curves. Obviously, the current peak connected with F-F transition for each ceramic is flatter, signifying the good polarization stability. (a) and (b) present the temperature dependence of in-situ k 33 T/k 33 RT and d 33 T/d 33 RT for the poled 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT samples. The k 33 T/k 33 RT values of all ceramics display a trend of monotone decrease as the temperature increases. The k 33 T/k 33 RT values of all samples reduce by within 10 % in the test temperature range from 30 to 100 \xb0C. When the test temperature increases to around T c of each ceramic, the k 33 T/k 33 RT only decreases 29 %, 24 %, 15 %, and 24 % for 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT ceramics, respectively, demonstrating the k 33 possesses good temperature stability. The in-suit d 33 is calculated by the formula : d = k *(\u03b5 T s E) /E^{33}E^{33}E^{33}E^{33}E^{1}E^{2}, where \u03b5 33 T is the free dielectric constant, s 33 E refers to the elastic compliance coefficient. The temperature dependence of \u03b5 33 T and s 33 E results of xPSN-(1 \u2013 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics are depicted in. As presented in (b), as the temperature increases, the variation trend of d 33 T/d 33 RT for each component is similar, showing an increase first and then a decrease near T f-f and T c. The temperature at which the d 33 value suddenly drops commonly refers to the depolarization temperature (T d). The T d values of the ceramic samples are 170 \xb0C (x / y = 0.06 / 0.35), 190 \xb0C (x / y = 0.15 / 0.37), 200 \xb0C (x = / y = 0.29 / 0.39) and 230 \xb0C (x / y = 0.43 / 0.40). From room temperature to the T d of each ceramic, the variation rate of d 33 is 13 %, 7 %, 5 % and 15 % for 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT ceramics, respectively. The results mentioned above mean that the PSN-PMN-PT ceramics exhibit a good thermal stability. In order to evaluate the potential of PSN-PMN-PT ceramics in ultrasonic transducers, the 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT sample with the highest d 33 of 665 pC/N is chosen as an active element of ultrasonic transducer. (b) and (c) displays the simulated and tested pulse-echo responses and Fourier spectra for the fabricated PSN-PMN-PT transducer, respectively. It can be seen that the measured f c and \u22126 dB bandwidth are 4.65 MHz and 77.4 %, respectively, which agree well with the simulated results (f c \u223c 4.69 MHz and BW \u223c 80.3 %). The \u22126 dB bandwidth of the PSN-PMN-PT transducer surpasses that of other transducers reported in the literature with the similar center frequency , as shown in (d). The IL of the transducer measured at f c is \u221221.45 dB, which is better than the transducer fabricated using PMN-PT single crystal (IL \u223c \u221228.7 dB). According to the obtained data, it can be concluded that PSN-PMN-PT ceramics exhibit great potential for ultrasonic transducer applications.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
displays the XRD patterns of xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics. Each sample is of pure perovskite structure without pyrochlore phase, which implies that PSN and PMN-PT have successfully formed a solid solution. For PT-based ferroelectric systems, the change of the phase structure can generally be reflected through the diffraction peak of (200) around 45\xb0. (b), (d), (f) and (h) depict the evolution of (200) diffraction peak with the variable composition. It is evident that with the increasing PT content, the same variation trend of the (200) peak is observed for PSN-PMN-PT samples with different x (x = 0.06, 0.15, 0.29, and 0.43). Taking the x = 0.15 ceramics as an example, when the PT content is less than 0.35 mol (y < 0.35), the (200) diffraction peak is single and the crystalline structure of these compositions is dominated by rhombohedral phase. As y increases to 0.35, the (200) peak starts to broaden, indicating that the phase transition begins in this component. When y further increases, a shoulder on the left side of the (200) peak occurs and its relative intensity gradually increases. As y rises to 0.40, the (200) peak almost splits into (200) and (002), suggesting that the tetragonal phase is dominant. For PT-based ferroelectric ceramics, grain size is one of the key factors affecting their electric properties, because the grain size determines the domain size, which is closely related to electric properties. As an example, presents the surface SEM images of the 0.15PSN-(0.85 \u2212 y)PMN-yPT, and illustrate the corresponding grain size distribution. The bulk density of these ceramics varies between 7.5 and 7.85 g/cmE^{3}, and the relative densities are greater than 95 %. According to the grain size distribution in , it has been observed that the mean grain size for all 0.15PSN-(0.85 \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics varies within a small range of 1.9 \u2212 2.38 \u03bcm, indicating the influence of grain size on the electric performances of x = 0.15 ceramics with different PT content can be ignored. This conclusion also applies to x = 0.06, 0.29, and 0.43 ceramics with different PT content in this study. To further determine the composition-induced phase transition behaviors of the PSN-PMN-PT ceramics, the fitting of the XRD patterns of x = 0.15 ceramics were fitted using the Rietveld refinement , the refined results are presented in and. The optimal Rietveld refinement results are achieved for all x = 0.15 ceramics by using the following phase models: R3m + Pm (R + MC) for y = 0.32 \u2212 0.33, R3m + Pm + Cm (R + Mc + MA) for y = 0.34, and P4mm + Pm (T + MC) for y = 0.35 \u2212 0.40, demonstrating that multi-phases with competing symmetries coexist in the PSN-PMN-PT system. The detailed phase volume fractions of all x = 0.15 ceramics based on the refined results is exhibited in. Clearly, in the ceramics with y = 0.32 and 0.33, the R and MC phases coexist and MC phase is dominant, and the MC phase fraction is 72 % and 89 %, respectively. For y = 0.34 ceramic, the three-phase coexistence of MC, MA and R is observed, with volume fractions of 84 %, 6 % and 10 %, respectively. When the y exceeds 0.34, R and MA phases disappear, and the samples show the two-phase coexistence of MC and T. Moreover, as the y rises from 0.35 to 0.40, the T phase fraction progressively increased from 20 % to 70 % and the MC phase fraction decreased from 80 % to 30 %. The results of the phase fraction for x = 0.15 ceramics are consistent with the analysis in (b) and are also in agreement with the phase diagram. Previous studies have confirmed that the 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT ceramic consists of a combination of MC (21.19 %) and T (78.81 %) phases and T phase is dominant, implying that similar trend of phase fraction with increased PT content should be obtained in x = 0.06, 0.29 and 0.43 components. The multi-phases coexistence is an intrinsic feature in PSN-PMN-PT system, which is in good agreement with the observations in other PT-based ferroelectrics. The variations of the dielectric permittivity \u03b5 r and dielectric loss factor tan\u03b4 for poled xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics with temperature in the range of 30 \u2013 300 \xb0C are illustrated in (a)-(d). All measurements of the curves are measured at a frequency of 1 kHz. As can be observed, for x = 0.06, 0.15, 0.29 and 0.43 ceramics with low PT content, the presence of two distinct dielectric anomalous peaks is observed, corresponding to the phase transition of ferroelectric-ferroelectric (F-F) and ferroelectric-paraelectric (F-P), respectively. With the increasing PT content, the dielectric anomalous peak associated with F-F phase transition (at low temperature T f-f) gradually weakens and only a single dielectric anomalous peak connected with F-P phase transition (at high temperature T c) is obviously observed. The visual phase transition temperatures T f-f and T c for all xPSN-(1 \u2013 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT samples are depicted in (e). In all ceramics with the same x, the T f-f decreases while T c increases with increasing PT content, which can be ascribed to gradually increased tetragonal phase fraction, since the PT is of tetragonal phase as well as a high T c of 490 \xb0C. Besides, the observation indicates that, for the ceramics with the same PT content, the PSN-PMN-PT system exhibits an increase in both T f-f and T c as the PSN content increases, which results from the larger rhombohedral lattice deformation and higher T c of PSN in comparison with PMN. It should be noted that the tan\u03b4 of all ceramics is less than 0.05 in the whole test temperature range. Additionally, as the PT content increases, the dielectric anomaly peak connected with F-P phase transition in x = 0.06, 0.15, 0.29 and 0.43 ceramics gradually become narrow, indicating the relaxation behavior gradually weakens. Such dielectric relaxor behavior can be demonstrated by the modified Curie-Weiss law of 1/\u025b \u2212 1/\u025b max = (T \u2212 T max)E^{ }/C, where C represents the Curie-Weiss constant, and \u03b3 represents the diffusion coefficient, and \u025b max and T max refer to the maximum dielectric constant and the corresponding temperature, respectively. The fitting results of the representative 0.15PSN-(0.85 \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics are as depicted in (f). The calculated \u03b3 value decreases from 1.79 for y = 0.32 to 1.58 for y = 0.40 ceramics, which can be put down to the reason that PT is a classical ferroelectric. In the meantime, the high \u03b3 signifies the strong relaxor characteristics of the PSN-PMN-PT system, which can be attributed to the intensified ionic disorder and local charge mismatch at B site. (a) shows the variation trend of relative permittivity \u03b5 r of all components. As the PT content increases, the trend of \u03b5 r can be observed to exhibit an initial increase followed by a subsequent decrease in each special x. The maximum value is obtained near y = 0.35, 0.38, 0.39 and 0.41, respectively, for x = 0.06, 0.15, 0.29 and 0.43 ceramics. In combination with XRD analysis, these samples have the two-phase coexistence of T + MC and the T phase is dominant. The polarization-electric field (P \u2212 E) loops of xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT samples under a 20 kV/cm electric field are depicted in. The presence of well-shaped hysteresis loops with saturation in all samples clearly indicates their well ferroelectricity. (b) displays the remanent polarization P r and coercive electric field E c of the xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics. As y increases for each x, it is evident that the values of P r slightly fluctuate around 30 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, while the E c values gradually increase due to the increase of T phase fraction. For piezoelectric materials, piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) is commonly regarded as a crucial parameter that signifies the capacity to transform external force into charge. In general, the d 33 exhibits a direct correlation with the ferroelectric polarization and dielectric characteristics of piezoelectric ceramics. The equation of d 33\u221d \u03b5 r P r can be used to establish the relationships among them. (c) and (d) present the \u025b r P r and d 33 of xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics. It is evident that as PT content increases, both d 33 and \u025b r P r exhibit a similar tendency of initial increase followed by decrease, suggesting the improvement of d 33 is indeed resulted from the enhanced \u025b r P r. The maximum d 33 value for each x occurs at 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT samples and the corresponding value is 665, 620, 585, and 650 pC/N, respectively. It should be pointed out that the high d 33 for these ceramics mainly originates from enhanced \u025b r instead of P r, since the P r only presents a slight change. Combining the Rietveld refinement results of x = 0.15, it can be inferred that the high d 33 obtained at y = 0.36, 0.37 mainly results from the easy polarization rotation induced by external electric field owing to the appropriate phase fraction of T + MC. As the PT content is further increased, d 33 shows a marked decrease. Combining the refinement results, the decrease of d 33 can be attributed to the further increasing fraction of the tetragonal phase proportion, because the domain switching gets harder. Moreover, as the x increases, the component with the highest d 33 shifts to the region with higher PT content, which is due to the larger rhombohedral lattice deformation of PSN. The k p shows a similar trend to that of d 33, which exhibits an initial increase followed by a subsequent decrease as the y increases, and the k p value can reach up to 0.67, as depicted in. lists the detailed d 33 and k p values for each ceramic. The piezoelectric performances of piezoceramics are subject to temperature variation due to the thermal depolarization. presents the temperature-dependent pyroelectric current density for the poled 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT ceramics. We can obviously see that each sample exhibits two current density peaks and the corresponding temperatures are 70 \xb0C and 181 \xb0C for 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 75 \xb0C and 200 \xb0C for 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 75 \xb0C and 226 \xb0C for 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT, 68 \xb0C and 248 \xb0C for 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT samples. These temperatures are almost in agreement with their T f-f and T c obtained from \u025b r \u2212 T curves. Obviously, the current peak connected with F-F transition for each ceramic is flatter, signifying the good polarization stability. (a) and (b) present the temperature dependence of in-situ k 33 T/k 33 RT and d 33 T/d 33 RT for the poled 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT samples. The k 33 T/k 33 RT values of all ceramics display a trend of monotone decrease as the temperature increases. The k 33 T/k 33 RT values of all samples reduce by within 10 % in the test temperature range from 30 to 100 \xb0C. When the test temperature increases to around T c of each ceramic, the k 33 T/k 33 RT only decreases 29 %, 24 %, 15 %, and 24 % for 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT ceramics, respectively, demonstrating the k 33 possesses good temperature stability. The in-suit d 33 is calculated by the formula : d = k *(\u03b5 T s E) /E^{33}E^{33}E^{33}E^{33}E^{1}E^{2}, where \u03b5 33 T is the free dielectric constant, s 33 E refers to the elastic compliance coefficient. The temperature dependence of \u03b5 33 T and s 33 E results of xPSN-(1 \u2013 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics are depicted in. As presented in (b), as the temperature increases, the variation trend of d 33 T/d 33 RT for each component is similar, showing an increase first and then a decrease near T f-f and T c. The temperature at which the d 33 value suddenly drops commonly refers to the depolarization temperature (T d). The T d values of the ceramic samples are 170 \xb0C (x / y = 0.06 / 0.35), 190 \xb0C (x / y = 0.15 / 0.37), 200 \xb0C (x = / y = 0.29 / 0.39) and 230 \xb0C (x / y = 0.43 / 0.40). From room temperature to the T d of each ceramic, the variation rate of d 33 is 13 %, 7 %, 5 % and 15 % for 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT ceramics, respectively. The results mentioned above mean that the PSN-PMN-PT ceramics exhibit a good thermal stability. In order to evaluate the potential of PSN-PMN-PT ceramics in ultrasonic transducers, the 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT sample with the highest d 33 of 665 pC/N is chosen as an active element of ultrasonic transducer. (b) and (c) displays the simulated and tested pulse-echo responses and Fourier spectra for the fabricated PSN-PMN-PT transducer, respectively. It can be seen that the measured f c and \u22126 dB bandwidth are 4.65 MHz and 77.4 %, respectively, which agree well with the simulated results (f c \u223c 4.69 MHz and BW \u223c 80.3 %). The \u22126 dB bandwidth of the PSN-PMN-PT transducer surpasses that of other transducers reported in the literature with the similar center frequency , as shown in (d). The IL of the transducer measured at f c is \u221221.45 dB, which is better than the transducer fabricated using PMN-PT single crystal (IL \u223c \u221228.7 dB). According to the obtained data, it can be concluded that PSN-PMN-PT ceramics exhibit great potential for ultrasonic transducer applications.
