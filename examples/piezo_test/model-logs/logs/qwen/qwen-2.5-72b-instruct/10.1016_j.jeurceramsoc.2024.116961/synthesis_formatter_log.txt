Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'solid-state reaction', 'precursors': ['Na2CO3', 'K2CO3', 'Bi2O3', 'CeO2', 'Nb2O5', 'WO3'], 'steps': ['The formulated powders were blended in ethanol for 4 h using the planetary ball milling method.', 'Then calcination was implemented for 2 h at 850 °C of the dried slurries.', 'After secondary ball milling, the dried slurries were compressed into wafers (10 mm diameter) utilising 7 wt.% binder (polyvinyl alcohol).', 'Finally, the wafers were heated at 750 °C for 1 h to take out the polyvinyl alcohol and then sintering at 1100 °C for 2 h.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'SEM', 'Raman Spectroscopy', 'PFM', 'LCR Analyser']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
