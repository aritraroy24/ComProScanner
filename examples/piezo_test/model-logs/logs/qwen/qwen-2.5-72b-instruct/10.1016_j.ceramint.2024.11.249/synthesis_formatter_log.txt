Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'solid-state reaction', 'precursors': ['Bi2O3', 'TiO2'], 'steps': ['High-purity (99.99 %) Bi2O3 and TiO2 oxide powders were milled using an agate mortar and pestle to prevent agglomeration and ensure homogeneity.', 'The powders were dried at 150 °C to remove moisture.', 'The milled and dried powders were used to synthesize Bi4Ti3O12 through a solid-state reaction technique.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'Raman Spectroscopy', 'TG/DTG', 'SEM', 'EDX']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
