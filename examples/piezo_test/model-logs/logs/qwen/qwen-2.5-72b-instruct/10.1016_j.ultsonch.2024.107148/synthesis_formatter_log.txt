Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'High-Frequency Piezoelectric Ultrasonic Transducer (HPUT) Design', 'precursors': ['PZT-8 piezoelectric ceramic'], 'steps': ['The damping back cover, piezoelectric ceramic stack, flange plate, amplifying front cover, fixture rod, and tool rod are combined into a whole with a high-strength bolt made of 45-gauge steel.', 'The main parameters of PZT-8 piezoelectric ceramic are measured by impedance analyzer and LCR meter.', 'The design geometric dimensions of the HPUT are determined based on the theoretical model.', 'The temperature of the thermo-mechanical coupling load is limited to 25-95°C to avoid nonlinear effects.', 'The force of the thermo-mechanical coupling load is limited to 0-40 N for high-frequency working state.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['Impedance Analyzer', 'LCR Meter']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
