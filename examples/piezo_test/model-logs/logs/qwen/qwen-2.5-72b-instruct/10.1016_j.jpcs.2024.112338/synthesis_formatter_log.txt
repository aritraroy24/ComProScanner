Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'conventional solid-state reaction', 'precursors': ['Lead (II) oxide (PbO)', 'Zirconium dioxide (ZrO2)', 'Titanium dioxide (TiO2)', 'Molybdenum trioxide (MoO3)', 'Indium (III) oxide (In2O3)', 'Zinc oxide (ZnO)', 'Antimony trioxide (Sb2O3)', 'Samarium (III) oxide (Sm2O3)'], 'steps': ['The powders were mixed to form the desired composition.', 'The mixture was calcined at 900 °C.', 'The calcined powders were sintered at 1150 °C.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['EDS', 'FTIR', 'XRD', 'SEM', 'LCR meter', 'Photonic sensor', 'Ferroelectric tester']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
