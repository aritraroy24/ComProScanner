Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same.

**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'traditional solid-phase reaction', 'precursors': ['BaCO3', 'CaCO3', 'TiO2', 'ZrO2'], 'steps': ['According to the stoichiometric ratio, the raw materials were accurately weighed.', 'The weighed powder and moderate ethanol were mixed and ball-milled for 12 hours.', 'The mixture was placed into an oven and dried at 120 °C.', 'After the powder was completely dried, the powder was calcined at 1250 °C for 5 hours.', 'The calcined powder was ball-milled again for 12 hours.', 'The ball-milled powder was pressed into a desired size and shape by a cold isostatic press machine at 30 MPa for 15 minutes.', 'The sample was kept at a sintering temperature of 1400–1500 °C for 4 hours to obtain a dense ceramic plate.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'SEM', 'Raman Spectroscopy', 'P-E hysteresis loops', 'Impedance Analyzer', 'Quasi-static d33 meter']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
