The [001]-oriented BTO template powders were synthesized from Bi2O3 and TiO2 using the molten salt method, with an equal molar ratio of NaCl and KCl in a 1:1 wt ratio. The template powder was then sintered at 1100 \xb0C for 1 h. The BTO matrix powders were prepared by a solid-state reaction, with the Bi2O3 and TiO2 powders weighed according to the stoichiometric ratio. The raw materials were then calcined at 700 \xb0C for 2 h. To meet the requirements of the TGG method, the calcined powder was ball milled for 48h\u201372h to achieve a small particle size. The template and matrix powders were mixed by ball milling at a mixing speed of \u223c60 rpm, using xylene and ethanol as solvents. To the solution, 5 vol% of BTO template was added to the solution and stirred for 1 h to ensure homogenization. Tape casting was performed with a blade gap of 210 \u03bcm. After drying at room temperature for 8\u201310h, the tapes were cut into 10 \xd7 10 mm squares and laminated under a pressure of 75 MPa for 1\u20133h. The organics were burned off at 600 \xb0C for 3h. To assess the texture evolution of the BTO ceramics, the green bodies were heated in a tube furnace from 650 \xb0C to 1000 \xb0C at a rate of 10 E^{\xb0}C/min. The green bodies were then sintered in an oxygen atmosphere at 950 \xb0C for 0\u20136 h to measure their electrical properties. The phase composition and degree of texture were confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Panalytical X'Pert, Netherlands) with CuK\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 1.540598 \xc5). The Lotgering factor F 00l of the ceramics was determined by analyzing the diffraction peak obtained from XRD, with F 00l calculated by Equation. where I and I 0 are the intensities of the diffraction peaks of the textured and non-textured ceramic samples, respectively. The grain orientation distribution of the textured ceramics was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Helios NanoLab 600i, USA). Raman spectra were obtained by a 532 nm confocal Raman microscope (Raman, Renishaw InVia-Reflex, UK). The ferroelectric domain structures were examined by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM, Brooker Dimension Fastscan, Germany). Polarization versus electric field (P-E) hysteresis was measured with a ferroelectric tester (Radiant Technologies Inc., Precision Premier II, USA) at 50 Hz. The dielectric properties and impedance spectra were obtained using an LCR meter at a frequency of 1 MHz (TH2827C, Changzhou Tonghui Electronic Co.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Samples with a surface perpendicular to the c-axis were labeled as BTO(\u22a5), while samples with a surface parallel to the c-axis were labeled as BTO(\u2016). The XRD patterns of the textured BTO(\u22a5) and BTO(\u2016) ceramics at different sintering temperatures are shown in , where a maximum F 001 value of 98 % was achieved in the BTO textured ceramics sintered at 950 \xb0C. (b) shows the XRD patterns of the non-textured, BTO(\u2016), and BTO(\u22a5) ceramics, indicating that no impure phase was observed in any of the samples. Compared to the non-textured ceramic, the BTO (\u2016) and BTO (\u22a5) ceramics exhibited significant anisotropy. As shown in (c), the lattice constants were calculated using PowderX diffraction analysis software from the XRD patterns of the BTO(\u2016) ceramics. The average lattice strain \u03b7 hkl at different sintering temperatures with different F 001 values was calculated by the following formula : \u03b7 hkl = (d hkl - d CIF,hkl )/d CIF,hkl , where d hkl is the d spacing of (hkl) plane along the a-, b- or c-axis of the BTO ceramics, and d CIF,hkl is the d spacing of the reference crystallographic information file (CIF) with lattice constants of a = 5.4475 \xc5, b = 5.4082 \xc5, and c = 32.8066 \xc5. The lattice strain of the (200) plain was calculated, corresponding to the polarization direction of the BTO ceramics along the a-axis direction. The lattice strain \u03b7 (200) of the non-textured ceramics is 0.24 %. For textured ceramics, the \u03b7 (200) value become negative as F 001 increases. When the F 001 reached 98 %, the \u03b7 (200) value was \u22120.27 %, demonstrating the compressive lattice strain in the textured ceramics. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the BTO(\u2016) ceramics and non-textured ceramics are depicted in (d)(f). The observed grain size of the BTO(\u2016) ceramics was 19.8 \u03bcm in length and 1.97 \u03bcm in width, and these values were larger than the grain size of 18.2 \u03bcm in length and 1.86 \u03bcm in width for the non-textured ceramics. As shown in (e)(g), piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) was used to investigate the domain structure of the BTO (\u2016) and non-textured ceramics, according to the literature. The domain size had a length of 2 \u03bcm and width of 1.33 \u03bcm in the BTO (\u2016) ceramic, which was larger than the non-textured ceramic, with a length of 1.8 \u03bcm and width of 1.14 \u03bcm. The increase in domain size was mainly due to the large lattice strain in the BTO(\u2016) ceramics , which was calculated by: \u03b7 i = (\u03b3 i P i E^{ })/K, where \u03b3 and K denote the strain-polarization coefficient and elastic constant, respectively , with the strain proportional to the square of polarization when the polarization was small. Based on this relationship, the large lattice strain in the BTO(\u2016) ceramics resulted in a higher polarization of the BTO(\u2016) ceramics compared to the non-textured ceramics. The polarization, dielectric and piezoelectric properties of the BTO(\u2016) ceramics and non-textured ceramics are described in detail below. The electrical properties of the BTO(\u2016), BTO(\u22a5), and non-textured ceramics at room temperature were compared, as shown in. (a) presents the polarization vs electric field (P-E) loops at 90 kV/cm, indicating that the ferroelectric properties exhibited high anisotropy. In the BTO (\u22a5) ceramics, the ferroelectricity was very weak due to the nonpolar c-axis of the BTO material. In the BTO (\u2016) ceramics, the remnant polarization P r was 16 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, which was significantly higher than that of the non-textured ceramics (11 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}). As shown in (b), the dielectric constant \u03b5 r of the textured ceramics also exhibited obvious anisotropy. The dielectric anomaly was observed around \u223c680 \xb0C, corresponding to the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition temperature (Curie temperature T c). The \u03b5 r of the BTO (\u2016) ceramics was significantly higher than that of the BTO (\u22a5), and the \u03b5 r of the non-textured ceramics was between the BTO(\u2016) and BTO(\u22a5) ceramics. (c) presents the dielectric loss tan\u03b4 of the BTO textured ceramics and non-textured ceramics at 1 MHz as a function of temperature. Notably, the tan\u03b4 of BTO(\u22a5) was significantly lower than that of the BTO(\u2016) and non-textured ceramics, which is mainly attributed to (Bi2O2)E^{2+} acting as an insulating layer to prevent charge jumping. The DC resistivity of the BTO textured ceramics and non-textured ceramics from 200 \xb0C to 700 \xb0C is shown in. As illustrated in (a) and (b), P r and \u03b5 r were higher for the textured BTO (\u2016) ceramics compared to the non-textured ceramics. According to d 33\u221dP r \u03b5 r , d 33 increased by increasing P r and \u03b5 r. Therefore, we obtained the piezoelectric constants d 33 for the BTO (\u2016) and non-textured ceramics at different annealing temperatures, as shown in (d). The d 33 value of 19 pC/N for the BTO (\u2016) ceramics was twice the value of the non-textured ceramics (9 pC/N), consistent with PFM analysis. Moreover, the d 33 of BTO (\u2016) decreased by only 11.5 % when the annealing temperature reached 650 \xb0C, far below that of the non-textured ceramics (55.5 %). The T c and d 33 values of the BTO(\u2016) ceramics were compared with the other high-temperature piezoelectric ceramics, as shown in (e). The d 33 values of the BTO(\u2016) ceramics were higher than the values of CaBi2Nb2O9-based , Bi3TiNbO9-based , and other Bi4Ti3O12-based ceramics reported in the literature. The Raman spectra of the poled and unpoled BTO (\u2016) ceramics were obtained to further understand the lattice strain in the textured ceramics, as shown in (a). The polarization field strength for poling was 40 kV/cm. (b) and (c) presents the fitted results of the Raman spectra for the BTO (\u2016) ceramics before and after poling. The Raman modes at 850 cmE^{\u22121} and 615 cmE^{\u22121} corresponded to the A1g modes associated with the rotation or vibration of the TiO6 octahedron. The mode at 612 cmE^{\u22121} (unpoled) shifted towards 615 cmE^{\u22121} (poled), and the mode at 849 cmE^{\u22121} (unpoled) shifted towards 850 cmE^{\u22121} (poled) ((d)). The shift of the A1g mode to a higher wavenumber indicated that the TiO6 octahedron was under compressive strain. The decrease in FWHM indicated a greater tilt of the TiO6 octahedron, resulting in higher ferroelectric polarization. The modes at 89 cmE^{\u22121} and 114 cmE^{\u22121} were associated with the A-site ions in the pseudo-perovskite units. Meanwhile, the shift from 89 cmE^{\u22121} to 91 cmE^{\u22121} and from 114 cmE^{\u22121} to 118 cmE^{\u22121} indicated movement towards higher wavenumbers ((e)). After poling, the peak intensity at 89 cmE^{\u22121} decreased while the peak intensity at 114 cmE^{\u22121} increased. confirming that the displacement of Bi ions played a crucial role in ferroelectric polarization. For the BTO (\u22a5) ceramics, the modes before and after poling did not significantly change and the peak intensity was only slightly reduced ((f)). The BTO (\u2016) ceramics were easily polarized, establishing long-distance polar order caused by the electric field-induced domain switch, and resulting in better piezoelectric properties compared to the BTO (\u22a5) ceramics. In addition, the spontaneous polarization P s of BTO(\u2016) and the non-textured ceramics could be calculated using the Shimakawa model, based on atomic displacements : Ps= \u2211i mi\u2217\u25b3 xi\u2217 QieV, where m i represents site multiplicity, \u0394x i signifies each atomic displacement, Q i e is the ionic charge, V denotes the volume of the unit cell, and i is the index of each atom in the unit cell. As shown in (g) and (h), the P s of the BTO (\u2016) ceramics was approximately 30.4 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, which was greater larger than that of the non-textured ceramics (17.3 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}). The increase in P s could be attributed to the compressive strain in the BTO (\u2016) ceramics, which was consistent with the PFM analysis results. The relationship between the piezoelectric constant d 33 and compressive strain could be summarized as a function of F 001, as shown in (i). The d 33 value increased with increasing compressive strain, indicating that lattice strain increased the piezoelectric properties in the textured ceramics. Finally, the XRD patterns of the ceramics were obtained in the range of 24 \xb0C\u2013600 \xb0C to verify the temperature stability of d 33 for the BTO (\u2016) ceramics. As shown in (a), no impure phase appeared with increasing temperature, and the (117) peak shifted to a lower angle as the temperature increased from 24 \xb0C to 600 \xb0C, as shown in (b), indicating that the phase structure of the ceramics remained stable in high-temperature environments and only led to lattice expansion. (c) shows the lattice constants as a function of temperature. The values of a, b, and c gradually increased, and the values of a and b converged near 600 \xb0C, which was close to T c.

      "The template and matrix powders were mixed by ball milling at a mixing speed of ~60 rpm, using xylene and ethanol as solvents.",
      "To the solution, 5 vol% of BTO template was added to the solution and stirred for 1 h to ensure homogenization.",
      "Tape casting was performed with a blade gap of 210 Î¼m.",
      "After drying at room temperature for 8â€“10h, the tapes were cut into 10 Ã— 10 mm squares and laminated under a pressure of 75 MPa for 1â€“3h.",
      "The organics were burned off at 600 Â°C for 3h.",
      "To assess the texture evolution of the BTO ceramics, the green bodies were heated in a tube furnace from 650 Â°C to 1000 Â°C at a rate of 10 Â°C/min.",
      "The green bodies were then sintered in an oxygen atmosphere at 950 Â°C for 0â€“6 h to measure their electrical properties."
