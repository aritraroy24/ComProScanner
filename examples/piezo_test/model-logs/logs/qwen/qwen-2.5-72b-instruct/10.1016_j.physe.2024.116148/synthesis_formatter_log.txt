Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'Adsorption', 'precursors': ['MoS2', 'Ni', 'Pd', 'Pt', 'Ir'], 'steps': ['The geometry structure of pristine MoS2 unit cell was relaxed to ensure the reliability of subsequent results.', 'A 4 × 4 MoS2 supercell was constructed to screen which site is favorable for TM (Ni, Pd, Pt, Ir) adsorption.', 'TMs were adsorbed on 4 × 4, 3 × 3, and 2 × 2 MoS2 supercells to consider the influence of concentration.', 'The adsorption energies (E_ad) were calculated to characterize the thermodynamic stability of TMs adsorbed on MoS2.', 'AIMD simulations were carried out to understand the stability of the composed structures at room temperature.', 'The band structures of TM@MoS2 were examined to verify the semiconducting property.', 'The piezoelectric coefficients e_ij and d_ij were calculated to evaluate the piezoelectric properties of TM@MoS2.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['AIMD', 'Band Structure Analysis', 'Piezoelectric Coefficients Calculation']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
