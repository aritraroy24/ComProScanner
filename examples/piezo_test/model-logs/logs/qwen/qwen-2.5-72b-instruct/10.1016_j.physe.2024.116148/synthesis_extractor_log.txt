# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The geometry structure of pristine MoS2 unit cell was firstly relaxed to ensure the reliability of subsequent results, the obtained lattice parameter is 3.18 \xc5, which is in agreement with previous results. Based on the obtained reliable structure, a 4 \xd7 4 MoS2 supercell has been constructed to screen which site is favorable for TM = Ni, Pd, Pt and Ir adsorption, as shown in (a) and (b). It is found that the total energies of TMs adsorbed on TMo is lower than that on H and Ts sites as shown in. One can see that, after fully relaxion, the TMs adsorption hardly introduce obvious distortion into MoS2 except for the neighboring S atoms deviating from equilibrium sites. To consider the influence of concentration, we adsorbed the TMs on 4 \xd7 4, 3 \xd7 3 and 2 \xd7 2 supercells respectively (the lattice parameters for these MoS2 supercells without TMs are 12.72 \xc5, 9.54 \xc5 and 6.36 \xc5). collects the corresponding structural parameters of TM@MoS2. It is found that the lattice parameters of supercell with Ni, Pd, Pt and Ir are larger than that of pristine 4 \xd7 4 MoS2 supercell, which indicates that tensile strains with different amplitude have been introduced. As the adsorption concentration increases, the introduced strain increases from 0.45 % to 0.81 %, 0.29 %\u20131.06 %, 0.52 %\u20131.18 % and 0.44 %\u20131.34 % for Ni@ MoS2, Pd@MoS2, Pt@MoS2 and Ir@MoS2. Meanwhile, the Mo-S bonds length (d Mo-S) near TMs enlarged relative to the bond length in pristine MoS2 (2.412 \xc5). In , one can see that the d Mo-S in 4 \xd7 4 TM@MoS2 represents the maximum increment. Together with the variation of d Mo-S, the bonds length TM-Mo (d TM-Mo) elongated, but the TM-S (d TM-S) shorten. Such trend may be explained that, at low adsorption concentration, the distance of adjacent TMs is too long to interaction strongly, the TMs mainly interacts with the neighboring Mo atom (the phenomenon can be seen in the following band structures), at the meantime, the S atoms nearby are pushed deviated from equilibrium positions. When the concentration increases, the repulsive interaction between adjacent TMs strengthens, leading to the TMs stay away from the surface of Mo, and S atoms concurrently return to their pristine states again. To characterize the thermodynamic stability of TMs adsorbed om MoS2, the adsorption energies (E ad) have been calculated using the following formula: where the E total and E MoS2 refer to the total energy of MoS2 with TMs adsorption and pristine 4 \xd7 4, 3 \xd7 3 and 2 \xd7 2 MoS2 supercells, respectively. E TM represents the energy of the single TM atom, respectively. By comparing the E ad of different TMs on MoS2, we conclude that the Ir adsorbed on MoS2 possesses robust stability, followed by Ni@ MoS2 > Pt@MoS2 > Pd@MoS2. Furthermore, the integrated crystal orbital Hamilton population (ICOHP) analysis has been carried out. As shown in , Both the ICOHP of S-TM and Mo-TM bonds increase with increasing the adsorption concentration, which indicates that the strength of S-TM and Mo-TM bonds. The high diffusion barriers of TMs on the surfaces can effectively prevent the formation of metal clusters. Therefore, the diffusion barriers were studied based on CI-NEB as shown in. It is seen that the Ir and Ni atoms present the higher energy barriers about 1.07 eV and 0.82 eV, however, the energy barriers for Pt and Pd atoms are smaller about 0.45 eV and 0.27 eV, which indicates that the Ir and Ni atoms are more stable than that of Pt and Pd atoms on MoS2. Furthermore, as the adsorption concentration increases, the foreign atoms usually have more significant influence on the structure of MoS2, even destroying the MoS2 possibly, so the AIMD simulations are needed to carry out to understand whether the composed structures are stable at room temperature. As shown in (a)\u2013(d), all structures maintain excellent stability at 300 K after 5 ps, which implies the TMs on MoS2 with higher concentration do not destroy the structure of MoS2. The coupling of semiconducting and piezoelectric properties makes two dimensional MoS2 possibility to be integrated into modern micro-electronics technology, so it is necessary to examine that whether the semiconducting property of MoS2 has been preserved. In (a)\u2013(f) and , the band structures of TM@MoS2 are displayed, it can be seen that all structures possess similar profiles, in which the energy levels of TMs are all observed near the top of valence bands, forming p-type modulated MoS2. The fermi levels still stay in the gaps, so all TM@MoS2 exhibit semiconducting property. Compared with the band gap of pristine MoS2, after TMs adsorption, the band gaps of TM@MoS2 decrease and further reduce with increasing the concentration of TMs. Take the Ni@MoS2 ((a)\u2013(c)) and Ir@MoS2 ((d)\u2013(f)) as examples, one can see that the energy levels induced by Ni and Ir are located at the top of valence bands and hybridized with Mo-d mainly. Specifically, when the TMs are adsorbed on 4 \xd7 4 supercells, the impurity levels exhibit stronger localization near the fermi level. As the adsorption concentration increases, these impurity levels become delocalization gradually, and hybridized with Mo-d and S-p in the range of \u22122\u20130 eV. Such variation is the reason that a small quantity of foreign atoms hardly affects the pristine structures and properties of MoS2. It has been demonstrated that the pristine MoS2 monolayer possesses intrinsic in-plane piezoelectricity with the e 11 = 2.9 \xd7 10E^{\u221210} C mE^{\u22121} experimentally, and e 11 = 3.64 \xd7 10E^{\u221210} C mE^{\u22121}, d 11 = 3.73 p.m./V theoretically. In present work, when the TMs are adsorbed on MoS2 monolayer, the piezoelectric coefficients e ij and d ij make distinct variation. Expressly, the adsorption not only introduces local strain changing the in-plane piezoelectricity, but also the charge redistribution between TMs and MoS2 monolayer induces the out-of-plane piezoelectricity as well, as shown in. For 4 \xd7 4 supercells with TM@MoS2, the e 11 has no significant change compared with pristine MoS2 monolayer, except for the Ir@MoS2, its e 11 is enlarged to 5.29 \xd7 10E^{\u221210} C mE^{\u22121}. Further increasing the adsorption concentration, the e 11's for Ni@MoS2, Pd@MoS2 and Pt@MoS2 reduce gradually, but the Ir@MoS2 enhances. The discrepancy is attributed to the strong adsorption for Ir on MoS2 causes more remarked hybridization and local strain. The out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficients e 31, however, increase along with increased adsorption concentration. Obviously, the charge transfer in MoS2 monolayer occurs between Mo and S atoms within the basal plane. Upon the TMs adsorbed, a part of charge participates in the redistribution between TMs and MoS2 monolayer, accompanied with weakening the in-plane polarization and forming out-of-plane polarization, thus the inversed variation has been obtained between e 11 and e 31. According to the symmetry of TM@MoS2, the d 11 and d 31 can be calculated using the following formulas,  It can be seen that, the d ij is relied on the e ij and elastic constants C ij, so the larger e ij and smaller C ij will lead to stronger d ij. In , one can see that the C 11 and C 12 become smaller compared with pristine MoS2, and further decrease with increasing the adsorption concentration, thus larger d 11 and d 31 are obtained. Particularly, the d 11's are improved to 12.95 p.m./V and 11.14 p.m./V for Ir on 3 \xd7 3 and 2 \xd7 2 MoS2, which are larger than those of bulk materials like quartz (d11 = 2.3 p.m./V), Si0.83Ge0.16O2 (d 11 = 5.5 p.m./V), GaN (d 33 = 3.7 p.m./V), and AlN (d33 = 5.6 p.m./V). More importantly, the larger d 31 are obtained for all TM@MoS2 in a range from 0.07 p.m./V to 1.38 p.m./V, which is larger than reported Janus TMDs, Janus BiXY (X = S, Se, Te and Y = F, Cl, Br, I) and c-Sn2XY (X/Y=S, Se, Te). It can be seen that the electrostatic potential near the side of TMs adsorption is lower than that of another side, leading to the electrons easily flow to the side of containing TMs. This can be verified by the charge accumulation mainly observed between S and TMs atoms. Therefore, there is a vacuum level difference \u0394\u03a6 between upper and lower sides of TM@MoS2, as shown in (a)\u2013(f) and. For given TM adsorbed on MoS2, the \u0394\u03a6 increases with increasing the adsorption concentration. The larger \u0394\u03a6, the grater vertical polarization, expecting large out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficients, which can be demonstrated by the listed e 31 in. The e 31 is enhanced with enlarging \u0394\u03a6. Nevertheless, the correlation between e 31 and \u0394\u03a6 is slightly different, when different TMs atoms are adsorbed on MoS2. At low adsorption concentration, it is indeed shown that the large \u0394\u03a6 is accompanied by a large e 31. Unexpectedly, when the TMs are adsorbed on 3 \xd7 3 MoS2, the \u0394\u03a6 for four TM@MoS2 has a little difference, but the e 31 of Ni@MoS2 and Ir@MoS2 is larger than that of Pd@MoS2 and Pt@MoS2. More significant inconsistency is observed for 2 \xd7 2 TM@MoS2, our calculated \u0394\u03a6 of Ni@MoS2 is only 0.44 eV, which is smaller than that of Pd@MoS2 and Pt@MoS2, whereas the Ni@MoS2 has a large e 31 comparable with Ir@MoS2. By analyzing the E ad and electronegativity differences, we reveal that the increased magnitude of e 31 is also relative to the E ad and electronegativity differences, except for the \u0394\u03a6. The large E ad and electronegativity differences facilitate the more electrons involved in transfer, meanwhile, If the systems possess also a large \u0394\u03a6, which naturally results in greater piezoelectric coefficients. Conversely, if less electrons are transferred, even if it has a large \u0394\u03a6, TM@MoS2 hardly exhibits greater piezoelectric coefficients. For Ir@MoS2, although it has smaller electronegativity differences , but the great E ad and large \u0394\u03a6 are more propitious for charge to redistribution, thus it presents large e 31. The Ni@MoS2, in spite of small \u0394\u03a6, it has the largest electronegativity differences, and greater E ad only weaker than that of Ir@MoS2, resulting in large e 31 as well. In the case of the Pd@MoS2 and Pt@MoS2, the weak E ad and small electronegativity differences lead to a small number of charges transferred, even if they have larger \u0394\u03a6 than that of Ni@MoS2, but these two systems cannot emerge large e 31. Although the MoS2 possess in-plane piezoelectricity, the piezoelectricity only exists in odd layers for multilayer MoS2, which is disadvantage of applying MoS2 films in piezoelectric fields. Our previous work has shown that the energetically favorable stacking would become the AA stacking with the two MoS2 monolayers having same polarization by O atoms surface functionalization. It is inspired us to further explore that the unexpected change occurs after TMs adsorption. Generally, the AB stacking is the most stable configuration in bilayer MoS2, the second energetically favorable stacking belongs to AA stacking. Upon TMs adsorbed on bilayer MoS2, we firstly analyze the total energies of TMs adsorption on AA and AB stackings. Notably, for AA stacking, there are two situations needed to be considered that upward and downward interlayer polarization, as shown in the left and middle structures of (labeled as AA\u2193 and AA\u2191). The structure on the right of corresponds to the TMs adsorbed on AB stacking. To compare the total energies of above three structures, we define the \u0394E to describe the relative energies using the following formula, where, the E para and E antipara represent the total energies of AA and AB stackings. As shown in , when the TMs are adsorbed on 2 \xd7 2 and 3 \xd7 3 supercells, the AA stacking always be the energetically favorable configuration for all TMs adsorption in present work. However, at low adsorption concentration, only the Ir adsorption can transform the AA stacking as the most stable structure, the other TMs adsorption retain the AB stacking as the most stable structure. Evidently, the amount of charge accumulation in the interface region for AA\u2193 and AA\u2191 (the left and middle structures in ) is greater than that of AB stacking (the right structure in ), which indicates that the AA stacking is more stable than AB stacking. Another important character between AA\u2193 and AA\u2191 is that the interface charge accumulation in AA\u2193 is slightly more than that of AA\u2191. It is possibly related to the orientation between interlayer polarization and TM@MoS2 polarization. In , we further show the plane-average electron difference of AA\u2193, AA\u2191 and AB stackings for TM@Bi-MoS2. It can be seen that the amount of electron transfer for AA\u2193 and AA\u2191 is obviously larger than that of AB. For AA\u2193 and AA\u2191, the Mo atom (Mo dn) in the upper (lower) layer is directly above (below) the S atom (S up) at the interface in lower (upper) layer, while the S atom (S dn) at the interface in the upper (lower) layer sits above (below) the center of the triangle spanned by the Mo atom (Pt up) in the lower (upper) layer. The asymmetric stackings (AA\u2193 and AA\u2191) causes strong distortion of the spatially extended S p z orbital, making the interlayer charge transfer near the S atom significantly deviate from the symmetric distribution of the pristine MoS2. Therefore, more electrons are accumulated in the interlayer region relative to AB. From , it can be obtained that the vertical polarization orientation of TM@MoS2 is from TMs atoms to MoS2 layer. When the TM@MoS2 is loaded on another MoS2 layer forming AA\u2193 or AA\u2191, the total vertical polarization will superpose or partially counteract, which distinctly affects the charge transfer. The downward interlayer polarization, for AA\u2193 (the left structure in ), is parallel to the TM@MoS2 out-of-plane polarization, results in an increased intensity of polarization. However, For AA\u2191 (the middle structure in ), the orientation between TM@MoS2 out-of-plane polarization and interlayer vertical polarization is inversed, the intensity of total polarization is reduced with respect to that of AA\u2193, the charge accumulation in the interlayer region is slightly less than that in AA\u2193. Therefore, the electron transfer for AA\u2193 is slightly than AA\u2191, as reflected in. As for the AB stacking (the right structure in ), the Mo and S atoms in up layer are rightly on top of the S and Mo atoms in bottom layer. The generated upward and downward interlayer polarization cancels out, at the meantime, the charge redistribution mainly occurs in the layer of TM@MoS2, only a small amount of charge accumulated in the interlayer region. The energetically favorable stacking therefore is transferred to AA stacking. For TMs@MoS2 monolayers, it has been known that the stronger piezoelectricity can be obtained in 2 \xd7 2 supercells. Herein, take the 2 \xd7 2 TM@Bi-MoS2 as examples, we investigate the in-plane and out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficients as shown in. In , the elastic constants C ij indicate that the TM@Bi-MoS2 validate the Born\u2013Huang stability criteria , C 11 > 0, C 11 E^{2}-C 12 E^{2}>0. The C 33 increases with the decreased interlayer distances of TM@Bi-MoS2, the interlayer distance for pristine bilayer MoS2 with AA stacking is 3.09 \xc5. After TMs adsorbed, the interlayer distance for Ni@Bi-MoS2 changes slightly, followed by Pd@Bi-MoS2 and Pt@Bi-MoS2 about 3.04 \xc5. It is further decreased to 2.98 \xc5 for Ir@Bi-MoS2. The smaller interlayer distance indicates that larger stress would be caused when subjected to external strain, so the Ir@Bi-MoS2 possesses larger C 33. Due to the parallel polarization orientation for upper TMs@MoS2 layer and lower MoS2 layer, the e 11 basically equal the sum of the two monolayers. for example, the e 11 for Ir@Bi-MoS2 is about 10.98 \xd7 10E^{\u221210} C/m, which approximatively equals the sum of 8.19 \xd7 10E^{\u221210} C/m (Ir@MoS2 shown in ) and 3.64 \xd7 10E^{\u221210} C/m (MoS2 monolayer) [12]. Along the out-of-plane direction, the TM@Bi-MoS2 possess larger e 33 and e 31. Combined with the elastic constants, the corresponding d 31 and d 33 are calculated using the following formulas:  One can find that, Ir@Bi-MoS2 excepted, the d 33 of TM@Bi-MoS2 are greater remarkedly than d 11 and d 31, especially the d 33 of Ni@Bi-MoS2 reaches to 43.17 p.m./V, comparable with un-doped bulk ZnO. which implies that the TM@Bi-MoS2 are more sensitive to the mechanical stimulation along the out-of-plane direction. Additionally, for AA\u2193 and AA\u2191, as above discussed, the superposition and partial counteraction between vertical interlayer polarization and the TM@MoS2 out-of-plane polarization also have influence on the vertical piezoelectric coefficients, it is shown that the vertical piezoelectric coefficients of AA\u2193  are larger than that of and AA\u2191.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The geometry structure of pristine MoS2 unit cell was firstly relaxed to ensure the reliability of subsequent results, the obtained lattice parameter is 3.18 \xc5, which is in agreement with previous results. Based on the obtained reliable structure, a 4 \xd7 4 MoS2 supercell has been constructed to screen which site is favorable for TM = Ni, Pd, Pt and Ir adsorption, as shown in (a) and (b). It is found that the total energies of TMs adsorbed on TMo is lower than that on H and Ts sites as shown in. One can see that, after fully relaxion, the TMs adsorption hardly introduce obvious distortion into MoS2 except for the neighboring S atoms deviating from equilibrium sites. To consider the influence of concentration, we adsorbed the TMs on 4 \xd7 4, 3 \xd7 3 and 2 \xd7 2 supercells respectively (the lattice parameters for these MoS2 supercells without TMs are 12.72 \xc5, 9.54 \xc5 and 6.36 \xc5). collects the corresponding structural parameters of TM@MoS2. It is found that the lattice parameters of supercell with Ni, Pd, Pt and Ir are larger than that of pristine 4 \xd7 4 MoS2 supercell, which indicates that tensile strains with different amplitude have been introduced. As the adsorption concentration increases, the introduced strain increases from 0.45 % to 0.81 %, 0.29 %\u20131.06 %, 0.52 %\u20131.18 % and 0.44 %\u20131.34 % for Ni@ MoS2, Pd@MoS2, Pt@MoS2 and Ir@MoS2. Meanwhile, the Mo-S bonds length (d Mo-S) near TMs enlarged relative to the bond length in pristine MoS2 (2.412 \xc5). In , one can see that the d Mo-S in 4 \xd7 4 TM@MoS2 represents the maximum increment. Together with the variation of d Mo-S, the bonds length TM-Mo (d TM-Mo) elongated, but the TM-S (d TM-S) shorten. Such trend may be explained that, at low adsorption concentration, the distance of adjacent TMs is too long to interaction strongly, the TMs mainly interacts with the neighboring Mo atom (the phenomenon can be seen in the following band structures), at the meantime, the S atoms nearby are pushed deviated from equilibrium positions. When the concentration increases, the repulsive interaction between adjacent TMs strengthens, leading to the TMs stay away from the surface of Mo, and S atoms concurrently return to their pristine states again. To characterize the thermodynamic stability of TMs adsorbed om MoS2, the adsorption energies (E ad) have been calculated using the following formula: where the E total and E MoS2 refer to the total energy of MoS2 with TMs adsorption and pristine 4 \xd7 4, 3 \xd7 3 and 2 \xd7 2 MoS2 supercells, respectively. E TM represents the energy of the single TM atom, respectively. By comparing the E ad of different TMs on MoS2, we conclude that the Ir adsorbed on MoS2 possesses robust stability, followed by Ni@ MoS2 > Pt@MoS2 > Pd@MoS2. Furthermore, the integrated crystal orbital Hamilton population (ICOHP) analysis has been carried out. As shown in , Both the ICOHP of S-TM and Mo-TM bonds increase with increasing the adsorption concentration, which indicates that the strength of S-TM and Mo-TM bonds. The high diffusion barriers of TMs on the surfaces can effectively prevent the formation of metal clusters. Therefore, the diffusion barriers were studied based on CI-NEB as shown in. It is seen that the Ir and Ni atoms present the higher energy barriers about 1.07 eV and 0.82 eV, however, the energy barriers for Pt and Pd atoms are smaller about 0.45 eV and 0.27 eV, which indicates that the Ir and Ni atoms are more stable than that of Pt and Pd atoms on MoS2. Furthermore, as the adsorption concentration increases, the foreign atoms usually have more significant influence on the structure of MoS2, even destroying the MoS2 possibly, so the AIMD simulations are needed to carry out to understand whether the composed structures are stable at room temperature. As shown in (a)\u2013(d), all structures maintain excellent stability at 300 K after 5 ps, which implies the TMs on MoS2 with higher concentration do not destroy the structure of MoS2. The coupling of semiconducting and piezoelectric properties makes two dimensional MoS2 possibility to be integrated into modern micro-electronics technology, so it is necessary to examine that whether the semiconducting property of MoS2 has been preserved. In (a)\u2013(f) and , the band structures of TM@MoS2 are displayed, it can be seen that all structures possess similar profiles, in which the energy levels of TMs are all observed near the top of valence bands, forming p-type modulated MoS2. The fermi levels still stay in the gaps, so all TM@MoS2 exhibit semiconducting property. Compared with the band gap of pristine MoS2, after TMs adsorption, the band gaps of TM@MoS2 decrease and further reduce with increasing the concentration of TMs. Take the Ni@MoS2 ((a)\u2013(c)) and Ir@MoS2 ((d)\u2013(f)) as examples, one can see that the energy levels induced by Ni and Ir are located at the top of valence bands and hybridized with Mo-d mainly. Specifically, when the TMs are adsorbed on 4 \xd7 4 supercells, the impurity levels exhibit stronger localization near the fermi level. As the adsorption concentration increases, these impurity levels become delocalization gradually, and hybridized with Mo-d and S-p in the range of \u22122\u20130 eV. Such variation is the reason that a small quantity of foreign atoms hardly affects the pristine structures and properties of MoS2. It has been demonstrated that the pristine MoS2 monolayer possesses intrinsic in-plane piezoelectricity with the e 11 = 2.9 \xd7 10E^{\u221210} C mE^{\u22121} experimentally, and e 11 = 3.64 \xd7 10E^{\u221210} C mE^{\u22121}, d 11 = 3.73 p.m./V theoretically. In present work, when the TMs are adsorbed on MoS2 monolayer, the piezoelectric coefficients e ij and d ij make distinct variation. Expressly, the adsorption not only introduces local strain changing the in-plane piezoelectricity, but also the charge redistribution between TMs and MoS2 monolayer induces the out-of-plane piezoelectricity as well, as shown in. For 4 \xd7 4 supercells with TM@MoS2, the e 11 has no significant change compared with pristine MoS2 monolayer, except for the Ir@MoS2, its e 11 is enlarged to 5.29 \xd7 10E^{\u221210} C mE^{\u22121}. Further increasing the adsorption concentration, the e 11's for Ni@MoS2, Pd@MoS2 and Pt@MoS2 reduce gradually, but the Ir@MoS2 enhances. The discrepancy is attributed to the strong adsorption for Ir on MoS2 causes more remarked hybridization and local strain. The out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficients e 31, however, increase along with increased adsorption concentration. Obviously, the charge transfer in MoS2 monolayer occurs between Mo and S atoms within the basal plane. Upon the TMs adsorbed, a part of charge participates in the redistribution between TMs and MoS2 monolayer, accompanied with weakening the in-plane polarization and forming out-of-plane polarization, thus the inversed variation has been obtained between e 11 and e 31. According to the symmetry of TM@MoS2, the d 11 and d 31 can be calculated using the following formulas,  It can be seen that, the d ij is relied on the e ij and elastic constants C ij, so the larger e ij and smaller C ij will lead to stronger d ij. In , one can see that the C 11 and C 12 become smaller compared with pristine MoS2, and further decrease with increasing the adsorption concentration, thus larger d 11 and d 31 are obtained. Particularly, the d 11's are improved to 12.95 p.m./V and 11.14 p.m./V for Ir on 3 \xd7 3 and 2 \xd7 2 MoS2, which are larger than those of bulk materials like quartz (d11 = 2.3 p.m./V), Si0.83Ge0.16O2 (d 11 = 5.5 p.m./V), GaN (d 33 = 3.7 p.m./V), and AlN (d33 = 5.6 p.m./V). More importantly, the larger d 31 are obtained for all TM@MoS2 in a range from 0.07 p.m./V to 1.38 p.m./V, which is larger than reported Janus TMDs, Janus BiXY (X = S, Se, Te and Y = F, Cl, Br, I) and c-Sn2XY (X/Y=S, Se, Te). It can be seen that the electrostatic potential near the side of TMs adsorption is lower than that of another side, leading to the electrons easily flow to the side of containing TMs. This can be verified by the charge accumulation mainly observed between S and TMs atoms. Therefore, there is a vacuum level difference \u0394\u03a6 between upper and lower sides of TM@MoS2, as shown in (a)\u2013(f) and. For given TM adsorbed on MoS2, the \u0394\u03a6 increases with increasing the adsorption concentration. The larger \u0394\u03a6, the grater vertical polarization, expecting large out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficients, which can be demonstrated by the listed e 31 in. The e 31 is enhanced with enlarging \u0394\u03a6. Nevertheless, the correlation between e 31 and \u0394\u03a6 is slightly different, when different TMs atoms are adsorbed on MoS2. At low adsorption concentration, it is indeed shown that the large \u0394\u03a6 is accompanied by a large e 31. Unexpectedly, when the TMs are adsorbed on 3 \xd7 3 MoS2, the \u0394\u03a6 for four TM@MoS2 has a little difference, but the e 31 of Ni@MoS2 and Ir@MoS2 is larger than that of Pd@MoS2 and Pt@MoS2. More significant inconsistency is observed for 2 \xd7 2 TM@MoS2, our calculated \u0394\u03a6 of Ni@MoS2 is only 0.44 eV, which is smaller than that of Pd@MoS2 and Pt@MoS2, whereas the Ni@MoS2 has a large e 31 comparable with Ir@MoS2. By analyzing the E ad and electronegativity differences, we reveal that the increased magnitude of e 31 is also relative to the E ad and electronegativity differences, except for the \u0394\u03a6. The large E ad and electronegativity differences facilitate the more electrons involved in transfer, meanwhile, If the systems possess also a large \u0394\u03a6, which naturally results in greater piezoelectric coefficients. Conversely, if less electrons are transferred, even if it has a large \u0394\u03a6, TM@MoS2 hardly exhibits greater piezoelectric coefficients. For Ir@MoS2, although it has smaller electronegativity differences , but the great E ad and large \u0394\u03a6 are more propitious for charge to redistribution, thus it presents large e 31. The Ni@MoS2, in spite of small \u0394\u03a6, it has the largest electronegativity differences, and greater E ad only weaker than that of Ir@MoS2, resulting in large e 31 as well. In the case of the Pd@MoS2 and Pt@MoS2, the weak E ad and small electronegativity differences lead to a small number of charges transferred, even if they have larger \u0394\u03a6 than that of Ni@MoS2, but these two systems cannot emerge large e 31. Although the MoS2 possess in-plane piezoelectricity, the piezoelectricity only exists in odd layers for multilayer MoS2, which is disadvantage of applying MoS2 films in piezoelectric fields. Our previous work has shown that the energetically favorable stacking would become the AA stacking with the two MoS2 monolayers having same polarization by O atoms surface functionalization. It is inspired us to further explore that the unexpected change occurs after TMs adsorption. Generally, the AB stacking is the most stable configuration in bilayer MoS2, the second energetically favorable stacking belongs to AA stacking. Upon TMs adsorbed on bilayer MoS2, we firstly analyze the total energies of TMs adsorption on AA and AB stackings. Notably, for AA stacking, there are two situations needed to be considered that upward and downward interlayer polarization, as shown in the left and middle structures of (labeled as AA\u2193 and AA\u2191). The structure on the right of corresponds to the TMs adsorbed on AB stacking. To compare the total energies of above three structures, we define the \u0394E to describe the relative energies using the following formula, where, the E para and E antipara represent the total energies of AA and AB stackings. As shown in , when the TMs are adsorbed on 2 \xd7 2 and 3 \xd7 3 supercells, the AA stacking always be the energetically favorable configuration for all TMs adsorption in present work. However, at low adsorption concentration, only the Ir adsorption can transform the AA stacking as the most stable structure, the other TMs adsorption retain the AB stacking as the most stable structure. Evidently, the amount of charge accumulation in the interface region for AA\u2193 and AA\u2191 (the left and middle structures in ) is greater than that of AB stacking (the right structure in ), which indicates that the AA stacking is more stable than AB stacking. Another important character between AA\u2193 and AA\u2191 is that the interface charge accumulation in AA\u2193 is slightly more than that of AA\u2191. It is possibly related to the orientation between interlayer polarization and TM@MoS2 polarization. In , we further show the plane-average electron difference of AA\u2193, AA\u2191 and AB stackings for TM@Bi-MoS2. It can be seen that the amount of electron transfer for AA\u2193 and AA\u2191 is obviously larger than that of AB. For AA\u2193 and AA\u2191, the Mo atom (Mo dn) in the upper (lower) layer is directly above (below) the S atom (S up) at the interface in lower (upper) layer, while the S atom (S dn) at the interface in the upper (lower) layer sits above (below) the center of the triangle spanned by the Mo atom (Pt up) in the lower (upper) layer. The asymmetric stackings (AA\u2193 and AA\u2191) causes strong distortion of the spatially extended S p z orbital, making the interlayer charge transfer near the S atom significantly deviate from the symmetric distribution of the pristine MoS2. Therefore, more electrons are accumulated in the interlayer region relative to AB. From , it can be obtained that the vertical polarization orientation of TM@MoS2 is from TMs atoms to MoS2 layer. When the TM@MoS2 is loaded on another MoS2 layer forming AA\u2193 or AA\u2191, the total vertical polarization will superpose or partially counteract, which distinctly affects the charge transfer. The downward interlayer polarization, for AA\u2193 (the left structure in ), is parallel to the TM@MoS2 out-of-plane polarization, results in an increased intensity of polarization. However, For AA\u2191 (the middle structure in ), the orientation between TM@MoS2 out-of-plane polarization and interlayer vertical polarization is inversed, the intensity of total polarization is reduced with respect to that of AA\u2193, the charge accumulation in the interlayer region is slightly less than that in AA\u2193. Therefore, the electron transfer for AA\u2193 is slightly than AA\u2191, as reflected in. As for the AB stacking (the right structure in ), the Mo and S atoms in up layer are rightly on top of the S and Mo atoms in bottom layer. The generated upward and downward interlayer polarization cancels out, at the meantime, the charge redistribution mainly occurs in the layer of TM@MoS2, only a small amount of charge accumulated in the interlayer region. The energetically favorable stacking therefore is transferred to AA stacking. For TMs@MoS2 monolayers, it has been known that the stronger piezoelectricity can be obtained in 2 \xd7 2 supercells. Herein, take the 2 \xd7 2 TM@Bi-MoS2 as examples, we investigate the in-plane and out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficients as shown in. In , the elastic constants C ij indicate that the TM@Bi-MoS2 validate the Born\u2013Huang stability criteria , C 11 > 0, C 11 E^{2}-C 12 E^{2}>0. The C 33 increases with the decreased interlayer distances of TM@Bi-MoS2, the interlayer distance for pristine bilayer MoS2 with AA stacking is 3.09 \xc5. After TMs adsorbed, the interlayer distance for Ni@Bi-MoS2 changes slightly, followed by Pd@Bi-MoS2 and Pt@Bi-MoS2 about 3.04 \xc5. It is further decreased to 2.98 \xc5 for Ir@Bi-MoS2. The smaller interlayer distance indicates that larger stress would be caused when subjected to external strain, so the Ir@Bi-MoS2 possesses larger C 33. Due to the parallel polarization orientation for upper TMs@MoS2 layer and lower MoS2 layer, the e 11 basically equal the sum of the two monolayers. for example, the e 11 for Ir@Bi-MoS2 is about 10.98 \xd7 10E^{\u221210} C/m, which approximatively equals the sum of 8.19 \xd7 10E^{\u221210} C/m (Ir@MoS2 shown in ) and 3.64 \xd7 10E^{\u221210} C/m (MoS2 monolayer) [12]. Along the out-of-plane direction, the TM@Bi-MoS2 possess larger e 33 and e 31. Combined with the elastic constants, the corresponding d 31 and d 33 are calculated using the following formulas:  One can find that, Ir@Bi-MoS2 excepted, the d 33 of TM@Bi-MoS2 are greater remarkedly than d 11 and d 31, especially the d 33 of Ni@Bi-MoS2 reaches to 43.17 p.m./V, comparable with un-doped bulk ZnO. which implies that the TM@Bi-MoS2 are more sensitive to the mechanical stimulation along the out-of-plane direction. Additionally, for AA\u2193 and AA\u2191, as above discussed, the superposition and partial counteraction between vertical interlayer polarization and the TM@MoS2 out-of-plane polarization also have influence on the vertical piezoelectric coefficients, it is shown that the vertical piezoelectric coefficients of AA\u2193  are larger than that of and AA\u2191.
