**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'Solid State Reaction', 'precursors': ['Sc2O3', 'TiO2', 'ZnO', 'Bi2O3', 'Pb3O4'], 'steps': ['Weighing precise amounts of Sc2O3, TiO2, ZnO, Bi2O3, and Pb3O4 according to the stoichiometric ratio with an excess of 1 mol% for both Bi2O3 and Pb3O4.', 'Subjecting the resulting powders to ball milling in alcohol for 12 h.', 'Drying the milled powders.', 'Calcining the dried powders at 750 °C for 4 h to obtain pure BZT-BS-PT ceramic powders.', 'Performing two rounds of milling and drying.', 'Carrying out a granulation process by adding 5 wt% PVA to the powder mixture.', 'Pressing the ceramic green body under a uniaxial pressure of 200 MPa.', 'Heat treating the pressed green body at 600 °C for 4 h to remove any remaining adhesive material.', 'Subjecting the ceramic body to a buried firing process at 1000 °C for 3 h to achieve fully densified BZT-BS-PT ceramics.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'FE-SEM', 'Impedance Analysis', 'Ferroelectric Testing', 'Quasi-static d33 Measurement']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
