The machine learning dataset was derived from 101 CBN-based piezoelectric ceramic samples from 20 published studies (see SI for corresponding references), with information including chemical composition and d 33 values. In ML models, modelling with all features directly increases the computational cost and computational time significantly. Here we use Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and feature screening to filter out important descriptors. Firstly, PCC is calculated for all the initial features. The features are grouped according to 1\u2265 |PCC|>0.95, 0.95\u2265 |PCC|>0.9, 0.9\u2265 |PCC|>0.85 to ensure that the features in each group are highly correlated. The PCC correlation coefficient result is shown in. By PCC grouping, the twenty-six features are divided into nine groups, as shown in. There are total of 3\xd73\xd72\xd72\xd73\xd73\xd73\xd74\xd73=11644 combinations from the nine groups. Then three ML models including Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), Random Forest Regression (RFR) and Extra Tree Regression (ETR) are trained to pick out the feature combinations with the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). RMSE is calculated by the following equation: where yi is the actual value and yi\u02c6 is the predicted value of the data point. Finally, the feature descriptors for each model were reduced to 9 based on the calculated lowest RMSE. Considering the features have been reduced to single digits, the model can be trained directly with these 9 features. The training process uses grid search and cross-validation to find the ML model hyperparameters with the lowest error. The cross-validation errors of the three models are shown in (a), and it can be found that the GBR model has the best performance. (b) shows the predicted d 33 by the trained GBR model with the 9-tuple features, with the training and test sets split by 8:2. Both the training and test data are evenly distributed around the diagonal and the determination coefficient RE^{2} is 0.82, indicating that the GBR model has been trained reasonably well. For example, some possible compounds such as Ca1-x-y A x CyBi2Nb2-z B z O9 (A, C=Li, Na, K, Ce, Sm, Tb; B=W, Mn, Mo, Cu or ionophores formed by them) were predicted using the trained GBR model. The compound with the highest predicted d 33 value among these possible compounds is Ca1-2x (NaCe) x Bi2Nb2-x (W0.75Mn0.25) x O9, as shown in (c), the maximum predicted d 33 of 15.5 pC/N are obtained at x = 0.03. Considering the possible errors in the ML model prediction, five compositions of dopant elements were selected in experiments to find the compound with the optimum piezoelectric coefficient, i.e. the Ca1-2x (NaCe) x Bi2Nb2-x (W0.75Mn0.25) x O9(x = 0, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05) were prepared by the conventional solid state sintering method. Raw materials including CaCO3 (99 %), Bi2O3 (99 %), CeO2 (99.95 %), Nb2O5 (99.5 %), WO3 (99 %), Na2CO3 (99.8 %) and MnCO3 (98 %) were weighed according to the nominal composition and ground in a ball mill for 12 h. The powders were calcined at 900 \xb0C for 2 h and then ball milled again. After drying, the polyvinyl alcohol solution (PVA, 8 wt%) as a binder was added to the calcined powders and mixed well to form granulated powders. Then the granulated powders were compressed into pellets with 10 mm in diameter and 0.85 mm in thickness. The PVA was removed by holding the pellets at 550 \xb0C for 4 h, and the polycrystalline ceramics were prepared by sintering at 1140 \xb0C for 2 h. Finally, the standard 0.6 mm thick ceramic samples were obtained by double-sided grinding. Electrodes were made of firing gold pastes at 850 \xb0C for 10 min. The phase structure of the sintered ceramics was determined using an X-ray diffraction meter (XRD, D8-Advance, Bruker, Germany) with Cu-Ka radiation, and the XRD profile was analyzed using Jade software. To detect the variation of phonon vibrational modes, Raman spectra were measured by a Raman spectrometer (LabRAM HR800, HORIBA) at room temperature using laser excitation at 532 nm wavelength. The surface morphology of the ceramics was obtained by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Phenom XL, Netherlands). The temperature dependence of dielectric constant and loss of ceramics were measured by using impedance analyzer (HT-1200, Alpha-ANB, Novocontrol). For piezoelectric measurements, the ceramic sample was poled in silicone oil under an electric field of 100\u2013130 kV/cm for 15 min at 180 \xb0C, then d 33 of the samples was determined by using a quasistatic d 33 m (ZJ-3A, China) at room temperature. The resistivity of ceramic samples from room temperature to 600 \xb0C was measured using a high-temperature resistivity test system (HGDZ-1200, Hua Ce Testing Instruments Co., Ltd). A high sensitivity X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) system (EMXplus-9.5/12, Bruker, Germany) was used for EPR measurements. The domain structures were observed through piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM, Asylum Research MFP-3D) measurement on the AFM platform.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a) shows the XRD patterns of (NaCe) and (WMn) modified CBN ceramics powders. A single orthorhombic phase (PDF#49\u20130608) without any impurities is detected, suggesting that doping ions have been incorporated into the host lattice of CBN ceramics and formed a solid solution. The (115) peak shows the highest intensity, which is consistent with the most intense reflection of (112m + 1) in BLSFs. To further analyze the effect of co-doping on the crystal structure, Rietveld refinement of powder XRD data were studied for all samples through the Jade program using the orthorhombic space group A21am. As exhibited in (b) and (c), the lattice parameters refined a, b, c and the cell volume all exhibit a gradual decline followed by an increase with the increasing content of doping ions, reaching the minimum value at x = 0.03. In order to investigate the effect of dopant on the lattice symmetry of CBN-based ceramics, a new variable a/b is introduced and its value is presented in (c). This value initially decreases and subsequently increases with the increment of x, approaching a value of one at x = 0.03. The Raman curves exhibit a comparable profile for all content doped samples within the wave number range of 100\u20131000 cmE^{\u22121}, which may be related to the orthorhombic phase. The Raman spectra of CBN-based ceramics generally have two phonon vibrational modes: a high-frequency vibrational peak above 200 cmE^{\u22121} related to the [NbO6] oxygen octahedron, and a low-frequency portion below 200 cmE^{\u22121} associated with the vibration of the A-site cation. Here, four relatively strong (v 1-v 4) major phonon vibrational modes in the Raman spectrum were selected for further study , as shown in (e)\u2013(f). With the addition of dopant ions, v 1 is shifted to lower wave numbers than pure CBN, indicating that the A-site doping affects the vibration of CaE^{2+}, but there is no further effect as the doping content increases. v 2 is related to the lattice distortion of NbO6 , and the wave number of v 2 firstly decreases and then increases as the doping content increases when x \u2265 0.02, suggesting that lattice distortions are generated in the ceramic. The change in v 3 indicates that the dopant ions change the degree of tilt of the [NbO6] octahedron, while distortion occurs between the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layer and the perovskite-like CaNbO3 layer. The wave number of v 4 decreases and then increases with increasing doping content and reaches a minimum at x = 0.03, indicating that the asymmetric stretching and bending vibrations of Nb-O bond are most altered. (a)\u2013(e) illustrate the surface morphology of all component ceramics. The pure CBN ceramic exhibits a characteristic plate-like morphology, which is a distinctive feature commonly associated with BLFS. Ce doping effectively reduces the diffusion of ions along the a-b plane during sintering, thus inhibiting the growth of plate-like grains, and gradually forming the equiaxial morphology , as shown in (b)\u2013(e). (f) demonstrates the average grain size (length) and relative density of ceramics for all doping contents. Meanwhile, the average grain size (length) decreased dramatically from 12.7 \u03bcm to 4.14\u20134.57 \u03bcm with increasing substitution ion concentration. Furthermore, in CaBi2Nb2O9-based ceramics, a smaller grain size typically enhances the piezoelectric response. Optimized piezoelectric response is expected to be obtained in CBNCWM-0.03 ceramics. (a) demonstrates the piezoelectric coefficients of CBNCWM-x ceramics with different doping contents. d 33 reaches a maximum value of 17.2 pC/N at x = 0.03, which is far more than pure CBN with 5.5 pC/N. (b) exhibits the thermal depoling progress of all compositions by measuring the d 33 of ceramics at room temperature, following an annealing process at the specific depoling temperatures for 2 h. As the annealing temperature approaches T C, the d 33 values of all ceramics are decreased dramatically due to the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition. It was observed that d 33 of CBNCWM-0.03 ceramics only decreased by 9.3 % at 900 \xb0C, showing excellent high-temperature stability. To better understand the internal mechanism, the PFM images of pure CBN and CBNCWM-0.03 ceramics are depicted in (c)\u2013(f). Compared to pure CBN with a rod-like domain structure, the doped ceramic exhibits a submicron domain pattern, which is more uniform distribution within the selected area. Meanwhile, the vertical amplitude of CBNCWM-0.03 ceramic is larger than that of pure CBN in the same excitation voltage (7 V). The smaller domain size and more domains leads to an increase in the domain wall density, which contributes to the improvement of the piezoelectric response. (a) and (b) show the variation of dielectric constant (\u025b r ) and dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) at 1 MHz for all CBNCWM-x ceramics with temperature. In the range of 0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.03, T C exhibits an initial reduction from 925 \xb0C (pure CBN) to 913 \xb0C, followed by a gradual increase with subsequent increments in the dopant concentration x. This is similar to that change of structural distortion in the ceramics, which expresses as 2(a-b)/(a+b) , as shown in (c). In the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase, the [NbO6] oxygen octahedral distortion is caused by unequal Nb-O bond lengths. The symmetry of Nb-O bond decreases and then increases after the substitution of the dopant ions, as can be seen from the Raman spectrum v 4 above. From (b), it is seen that the (NaCe) and (WMn) substitution significantly reduces the tan\u03b4 in the high-temperature section (600\u2013800 \xb0C), which increases the dielectric stability of CBN ceramics and benefits to the application of in high-temperature fields. Resistivity represents a pivotal performance indicator for high-temperature piezoelectric materials, which has an important effect on the stability and reliability of high-temperature piezoelectric devices. (a) illustrates the temperature dependence of resistivity (\u03c1) for all compositions. The \u03c1 of the ceramic shows an exponential decrease with increasing temperature. This phenomenon can be attributed to the substantial activation of intrinsic carriers within the ceramic material as the temperature rises, thereby enhancing the high-temperature electrical conductivity of the ceramics. (c) shows that co-doping of (NaCe) and (WMn) significantly improves the resistivity of CBN ceramics under high temperatures, but the resistivity of the ceramic gradually decreases with further increase in doping amount when x > 0.02. In bismuth layered ceramics, oxygen vacancies (VO) and bismuth vacancies (VBi) are created due to the volatilisation of elemental bismuth during sintering. The replacement of low valence CaE^{2+} ions with high valence CeE^{4+} in the A-site, and NbE^{5+} replacement with WE^{6+} at the B-site could induce electron accumulation, generating charge compensation thereby reducing the hole carrier concentration and increasing the \u03c1 of ceramics. The donor doping process of Ce and W ions can be represented by the follow equations:  Meanwhile, the initial MnE^{2+} ionization will result in a further reduction in the VO \u2022\u2022 concentration, which is described as Mn +\u2192 Mn ++ e\u2032E^{2}E^{4}E^{2}. The coexistence of MnE^{2+} and MnE^{4+} can be corroborated by EPR results, as shown in (d). The EPR spectra displays the signals associated with multi-valent Mn ions (MnE^{2+}, MnE^{4+}) in the magnetic field between 310 and 360 mT. However, as the doping content is further increased, a high level of Ce and WMn introduce excess electrons, leading to higher carrier concentrations and paradoxically reducing the \u03c1 of ceramics. To further analyze the conductive mechanism of CBNCWM-x ceramics, it is possible to calculate the activation energy (E a ) of the DC resistivity by means of fitting the Arrhenius equation , where \u03c1 0, E a , kB, and T stand for the constant, activated energy, Boltzmann constant, and absolute temperature, respectively. Except for the pure CBN ceramics, the fitting results for all other compositions can be divided into two regions: the low-temperature section (LT, T < 300 \xb0C) and the high-temperature section (HT, T > 300 \xb0C). In the low-temperature region, the E a of the ceramics ranges from 0.86 eV to 1.06 eV, which is close to half of the secondary ionisation energy of the oxygen vacancies (1.4 eV), confirming that the main conductivity mechanism of the ceramics in the low-temperature region is the oxygen vacancy conductivity ; whereas the E a value locates in a rage of 1.59 eV\u20131.86 eV in the high-temperature region, which is close to half of the forbidden bandwidth of the oxygen octahedra (E g = 3.4 eV), indicating that the main conductivity mechanism is intrinsic conductivity. Compared with the pure CBN (E a \u223c1.7 eV), the introduction of doping ions leads to a shift from intrinsic to non-intrinsic conducting mechanisms in the ceramics. (a) shows that (NaCe) and (WMn) ions can effectively improve the piezoelectricity of CBN-based ceramics. Moreover, displays the d 33 and T C values of previously reported CBN-based ceramics.

- For precursors, just use the chemical name (no company or purity) and for characterization_techniques, only the instrument name or short name of the instrument for the instruments like XRD, Raman Spectroscopy, SEM, TEM etc.
- For synthesis_methods, use the short name of the method if possible, else write the full name and don't use method/reaction word at the end.
- For precursors, just use the chemical composition (if available) else chemical name (no company or purity)
- For characterization_techniques, try using short name of the characterization techniques like XRD, Raman Spectroscopy, SEM, TEM etc. if possible, else write the full name.
