A series of (1-x)(0.7BiFeO3-0.3BaTiO3)- x(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3-5 mol% Bi2O3 (x = 0.000, 0.001, 0.002, 0.003) ceramics were prepared using the traditional solid-state reaction method.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
displays the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, Rietveld-refined XRD patterns, the corresponding phase fraction and lattice constants of the BF-BT-xBNT ceramics. According to (a1), all ceramic samples possess stabilized perovskite crystal structures, along with a minor presence of Bi-rich impurity phases Bi25FeO39. This suggests that (Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3 integrate into the solid solution composed primarily of the BiFeO3-BaTiO3 well. To investigate the phase structure coexistence and variations in ceramics as influenced by the BNT content, (a2) - (a3) present a detailed XRD analysis focusing on the 2\u03b8 ranges of 31\xb0-32\xb0 and 38.5\xb0-39.5\xb0, respectively. With an increase in BNT-doping content, both the (110) and (111) diffraction peaks exhibit a slight shift towards higher angles, suggesting a reduction in the unit cell volume. This shift can be explained by the replacement of the host atom BaE^{2+} (r = 1.61 \xc5\uff0cCN=12) and BiE^{3+} (r = 1.03 \xc5 \uff0cCN=6)E^{33} by the chemical modifier (Bi0.5Na0.5)E^{2+} (r = 1.21 \xc5 , abbreviated as BNE^{2+} in the following text) in A-site, and the replacement of FeE^{3+} (r = 0.645 \xc5\uff0cCN=6) by TiE^{3+} (r = 0.605 \xc5\uff0cCN = 6). The ionic size mismatch between the substituted and substituting ions will inevitably lead to lattice distortion of the BF-BT-xBNT ceramics, ultimately enhancing their piezoelectric performance. Additionally, for BF-BT-based ceramics, the rhombohedral phase typically exhibits two split peaks in the 2\u03b8 range of 31\u201332\xb0 and 38.5\u201339.5\xb0, while the tetragonal phase is characterized by a single split peak in the 2\u03b8 region around 31\u201332\xb0. As x content rises, the pronounced splitting of the (110) diffraction peak gradually diminishes, implying the coexistence of rhombohedral (R) and tetragonal (T) phases in the ceramics. When x = 0.003, the pronounced overlapping peaks nearly merge into a single sharp peak, marking the transition from R to T Phase. It shows the dominance of T phase on a macroscopic scale when x increases to 0.003. In order to gain a clearer understanding of the phase structural changes in the ceramics, we performed peak fitting on the XRD (110) and (111) peaks, and the results are shown in. The peaks for compositions with x = 0\u20130.004 were perfectly fitted to both the R phase and T phase. To delve deeper into the ceramic\u2019s phase analysis, Rietveld-refined powder XRD data based on R (R3c), T (P4mm) and Bi25FeO39 (R3c) phases was conducted. As illustrated in (b) and , the raw data, fitting and error curves, are provided for the BF-BT-xBNT ceramics. The XRD refinement profiles show that the refined curve fits well with the experimental data. The accuracy of structural refinement is typically assessed based on the sigma value (sig) and the Rietveld parameter (R wp), which is within a credible range of 1.44\u20131.66 and 5.84 %-6.60 %, respectively. At normal temperature conditions, all ceramic specimens demonstrate the concurrent existence of both the R phase and the T phase, with approximately 5 % of the impurity phase Bi25FeO39 present. The phase fractions, lattice parameters and distortion of the oxygen octahedron in rhombohedral and tetragonal phases of the BF-BT-xBNT ceramics are summarized in (c)\u2013(e) and. As we can see that the lattice constants c and a of both the T phase and R phase exhibit an decreasing trend with increasing x content, consistent with the previous XRD analysis. In particular, at x = 0.001, lattice constants a and c decrease and tetragonal distortion increases, in which the oxygen octahedral structures of the tripartite lattice and the tetragonal lattice are shown in (e). On the one hand, the smaller-radius BNE^{2+} and TiE^{4+} ions substitute BaE^{2+} at the A-site and FeE^{3+} at the B-site, respectively, causing the contraction of the cell. On the other hand, since the electronegativity of BiE^{3+} (2.02) and NaE^{+} (0.93) are greater than that of BaE^{2+} (0.89) , the BNE^{2+} substituted ion has a greater attractive force to OE^{2-}, causing the distortion of the oxygen octahedron. To delve deeper into the local structural variations, the Raman spectra collected at room temperature within the range of 123\u2013800 cmE^{\u22121} were decomposed into several distinct peaks in the (a). According to reports, pure BFO materials belonging to the R3c space group exhibit primarily 13 Raman active modes which can be classified as \u0413R(R3c) = (4A1 + 9E). However, due to the presence of the weak and overlapped modes, certain specific Raman active modes are not observable or detectable in ceramic materials composed of BF-BT. For BF-BT-based ceramic materials, Raman peaks are typically categorized into three regions. In the region of low wavenumbers (\u2264 150 cmE^{\u22121}), Raman peak modes correspond to the vibration of the A-site ion, with the patterns of A1-1and E1being unobservable. The modes in second region (150\u2013400 cmE^{\u22121}) are concerned with the vibration of B-O bond, which principally represents the vibration of the B-site ion. As shown in (b), the peaks of E-2, A1-2 and A1-3 shift to a lower wavenumber region, implying a weakening of both the non-degenerate state and the doubly degenerate state of B-O bonds. The shifts towards lower wavenumbers observed in the E-5, E-6, and E-9 modes indicates that the doping of BNT weakened the hybridization between the oxygen p-orbitals and the empty FeE^{3+}/TiE^{4+} d-orbitals. The E-7 modes in the high wavenumber region (\u2265 400 cmE^{\u22121}) is closely associated the distortion of BO6 octahedron. In general, we can use the intensity ratio of I(E-7)/I(A1-4) to measure the degree of distortion of the BO6 octahedron in different ceramic components. The ratio of I(E-7)/I(A1-4) in ceramic samples, as clearly depicted in (d), augments at x = 0.001, indicating that trace doping of BNT will blow up the distortion of BO6 octahedral. It is generally believed that the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the Raman band is correlated with the symmetry of BO6 octahedron. The FWHM of some characteristic modes is summarized in (c). The FWHM of A1-2, E-2, E-6, and E-9 modes increase with x content. This broadening is attributed to several factors: the heightened structural disorder induced by BNT doping, the overlapping of phonons in distinct Brillouin zone regions, and the enhanced local heterogeneity. All the above-mentioned results indicate that incorporating BNT-doping into the structure leads to disorder and enhances the random fields. According to reports published , alterations in valence state of Fe ions and the presence of charged imperfections, like oxygen vacancies (V O \u2219\u2219), contribute to substantial leakage currents and dielectric losses, thus affecting piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties. Therefore, in order to evaluate the scenario of FeE^{3+}(2p) transitions and the generation of oxygen vacancies in ceramics, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted on BF-BT-xBNT ceramics, as illustrated in (e\u2013g). For x = 0.000 and 0.001 samples, there are two discernible broad asymmetric peaks associated Fe 2p 1/2 with and Fe 2p 3/2 shown in (e). The XPS spectrum of Fe 2p 3/2 exhibits two peaks situated around 709.4 eV and 710.9 eV, demonstrating the coexistence of FeE^{2+} and FeE^{3+}. Based on the fitting results, the concentrations of FeE^{3+} and FeE^{2+} were found to be in ratios of 69.5: 30.5 and 78.7: 21.3 with increase x contents, indicating that the conversion of FeE^{3+} to FeE^{2+} in the ceramic is inhibited [as illustrated in (g) and summarized in ]. This may be attributed to the substitution of FeE^{3+} by TiE^{4+}. In particular, the binding energy for x = 0.001 sample exhibited a shift towards higher values than that of the x = 0.000 sample. (f) summarizes the asymmetrical O 1 s photoelectron peaks, which are divided into three sub-peaks. For all ceramics samples, the lowest binding energy OI peak (\u223c529.5 eV) is assigned to the cation-oxygen bonds. The higher energy peaks, OII (\u223c530.3 eV) and OIII (\u223c531.4 eV), are indicative of the presence of oxygen vacancies and the absorbed H2O, respectively. Compared with the undoped ceramics, when x = 0.001, OI, OII and OIII changed from 29.8 %, 26.3 % and 43.9\u201327 %, 23 % and 50 % respectively. It is worth mentioning that as the doped BNT-content increase, the peaks area ratio representing oxygen vacancy reduced significantly while the area ratio of adsorbed oxygen increased, as shown in (g) and. The complex ion substitutions induced by BNT doping suppress the reduction of FeE^{3+}, thereby reducing the formation of oxygen vacancies. As aforementioned, it is founded that doping BNT can inhibit the change valence of FeE^{3+} and the generation of V O \u2219\u2219, thus reducing the leakage current and improving the piezoelectric properties of ceramics. T C is typically identified as the temperature at which the dielectric peak occurs in \u03b5 r - T measurement, denoted as T m. As the content of BNT increases, the dielectric peak of the BF-BT-xBNT ceramic broadens obviously, and T m gradually moves to the high temperature direction with the increase of frequency. According to previous reports , in the following discussion, we use the change of T m at 1 kHz to analyze the variation in the ceramic phase transition. The impact of BNT content on the phase transformation of BF-BT-xBNT ceramics was investigated by measuring the temperature-dependent dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) and dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) , as illustrated in (a)\u2013(d). It is clearly observed that all the ceramics exhibit a dielectric anomaly peak only around 480 \xb0C within the testing range, with no significant dielectric anomalies at other temperatures. This indicates that within the test range, the BF-BT-xBNT ceramics undergo a ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition near the T m. As shown in (f), compared to the undoped ceramics, the ceramics with x = 0.001 show almost no decrease in T m (484 \xb0C). Whereas as x increases, T m decreases to 478 \xb0C. That\u2019s because the doped non-lone pair ion replaced the lone pair ion BiE^{3+}, thus interfering with the polar coupling in the system. Moreover, the reduction of T m is significantly closely linked to the decreased R/T phase ratio , which aligns with the XRD results. The tan\u03b4 stays consistent at low temperatures and then quickly escalates as x increase. Additionally, the introduction of BNT content leads to a gradually broadened dielectric curve, implying the phase transition became increasingly diffused. To gain a deeper understanding and quantitative assessment the diffusion and relaxation characteristics of phase transitions, we employ a revised Curie-Weiss law to represent the degree of phase transition diffusiveness, as shown by the as following: where \u03b5 r is the dielectric constant, \u03b5 m is the maximum dielectric value, T m is the temperature corresponding to \u03b5 m, C is the Curie-Weiss constant, and \u03b3 is the diffuseness coefficient. Generally, \u03b3 = 1 and \u03b3 = 2 represent normal ferroelectrics and ideal relaxor, respectively, while the values of \u03b3 between 1 and 2 indicate relaxor ferroelectrics. (e) and display the fitting results of the ln (T - T m) as the independent variable versus ln (1/\u03b5 r - 1/\u03b5 m) function. The \u03b3 values increases with x, indicating the strengthened dielectric relaxation. In addition, the relaxation behavior of the ceramics can also be characterized by fitting the experimental data to the Vogel-Fulcher law, as shown in : where f is the driving frequency, f 0 is the characteristic frequency, E a is the activation energy, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T f is the freezing temperature, representing the boundary between the ergodic and non-ergodic states. With the doping of BNT, the relaxation behavior of the ceramics improves. Meanwhile, with the variation in composition, the T f of ceramic exhibits a slight decrease from 470 \xb0C to 451 \xb0C. Specifically, when x = 0.001, T f = 466 \xb0C. It may imply that the doped ceramics are still capable of maintaining a relatively high operational temperature limit. (a\u2013d) present the SEM images of the polished surfaces (a-b) and thermally etched surfaces (c-d) for BF-BT-xBNT ceramics with different amounts of BNT. When x = 0.001, the ceramics have a lower porosity. The enhanced growth of the grains can be ascribed to the increase of impurity phase Bi25FeO39 content, which forms a liquid phase and facilitates grain growth during sintering. In conclusion, the incorporation of BNT results in a gradual enlargement and greater uniformity of grain size. And micro-doping of BNT has minimal impact on porosity while aiding in enhancing the density of ceramics. The PFM technique is utilized to conduct a deeper analysis of the domain configurations in BF-BT-xBNT ceramics with different modifier concentrations. (a\u2013d) shows the vertical PFM information of the ceramics at x = 0.000 and 0.001, including amplitude and phase patterns. It's evident that the amount of BNT doping significantly impacts the size and shape of the domains in the ceramics. The ceramic sample at x = 0.000 exhibits heterogeneous domain compositions characterized by macro-scale long stripe domains, leading to an effective piezoelectric response to the tip voltage. However, the ceramic sample at x = 0.001 exhibits larger island-like domain regions and a few smaller domain regions, indicative of the T phase featuring a singular XRD peak and dielectric relaxation. The incorporation of BNT enhances particles expansion and the formation of microdomains, destroys the original regularity of domain morphology and size to a certain extent, and weakens the ferroelectric long-range order. In contrast to the x = 0.000 samples, the x = 0.001 samples exhibit larger domain structures and lower domain walls, contributing to the domain switching. The complicated domain configuration is observed from the corresponding piezo response image at x = 0.001, revealing submicron-size domain morphology. This is because the incorporation of BNT may promote the development of microdomains, and the coexistence of macrodomain and microdomain helps to maintain their rotated states, resulting in a strong piezoelectric response. Furthermore, in comparison to the undoped sample, the major domain regions in the x = 0.001 sample are oriented with upward polarization, allowing the polarization vector to easily align in the out-of-plane direction under external stimuli. This may contribute to the enhanced piezoelectric response of BNT-doped ceramics. Therefore, both the quality and quantity of the domains at x = 0.001 are significantly improved compared to the undoped ones, leading to a robust piezoelectric response, which is consistently linked with increased piezoelectricity. The local poling treatment (litho-mode) of PFM are shown in (e-h). At x = 0.000, only a limited number of domains switch at 10 V, while most switch at 20 V. In contrast, for the x = 0.001 sample, domains switch completely at a low electric voltage of 5 V, while the rotated domain region at 15 V extends beyond the area indicated by white dashed line square. Meanwhile, BNT-doped samples are more prone to domain switching, implying that BNT doping is beneficial to reduce the domain wall and increase its mobility. These findings suggest that domains in the x = 0.001 ceramic are more easily switchable than those in the x = 0.000 ceramic, which is one of key factor contributing to the enhanced electromechanical performance observed in the ceramic with x = 0.001. (a1\u2013a4) show polarization-electric field (P-E) loops of BF-BT-xBNT ceramics measured at 60 kV/cm from room temperature to 120 \xb0C. The anomalous behavior observed in BF-BT-xBNT ceramics may be related to the incomplete saturation of the ceramic\u2019s polarization. Additionally, studies have shown that this anomalous polarization behavior is associated with the weakening of antiferroelectric distortion and re-entrant relaxation behavior in BFO ceramics. At 120 \xb0C, P r decreases with x increasing, and E c increases with x increasing. This may be related to the increase of lattice distortion caused by BNT doping. Lattice distortion may affect the ferroelectric domain structure in ceramics, making it more difficult to flip polarization, resulting in an increase in P r and E c. (b1-b4) exhibit bipolar strain loops recorded at various temperatures from 30 \xb0C to 120 \xb0C. Additionally, at high temperature, the strain values of ceramics initially rise and then decline with varying x values, peaking at x = 0.001. This phenomenon indicate that BNT doping may enhance improving the ferroelectric properties of the ceramics at high temperature. (e) exhibits unipolar strain loops measured at different temperatures from 30 \xb0C to 120 \xb0C. The results show that the unipolar strain of x = 0.001 exhibits a gradual increase as temperature rises, and maintains a relatively consistent growth rate. It is noteworthy that the composition dependence of P r and E c value appears abnormal above 100 \xb0C. In addition to the lattice distortion mentioned earlier, PFM results are also consistent with this phenomenon. For the sample with x = 0.000, macro domains featuring long stripes dominate, leading to a sustained high growth rate of P r even under elevated temperatures. Conversely, a trace number of nanodomains in the sample with x = 0.001 results in a slower growth rate of P r at high temperature. Therefore, the anomalous behavior of composition-dependent P r value above room temperature is elucidated. (a) and (b) show the influence of BNT on the piezoelectric constant d 33, planar electromechanical coupling coefficient k p, dielectric constant \u03b5 r, dielectric loss tan\u03b4 and quality factor Q m values of x on the BF-BT-xBNT ceramics, measured at room temperature after 24 h of poling. (a) displays an initial increase in the values of k p and d 33, subsequently followed by a decline, reaching an optimal value near x = 0.001 (d 33 = 202 pC/N). In general, the piezoelectric properties of ferroelectrics are assessed through the following : Where Q is the temperature-independent electrostriction coefficient, \u03b5 r is the dielectric constant, and P r is the remanent polarization intensity. Therefore, the increase of d 33 in the first stage may be influenced by the increase of P r, and the subsequent decrease is due to the more drastic decrease of \u03b5 r. The BNT doping can cause the change of phase structure, resulting in decreased R/T phase ratio, which contributes to the improvement of piezoelectric properties. The dielectric loss tan\u03b4 and dielectric constant \u03b5 r decrease, and the mechanical quality factor Q m increase with the rise in x, as shown in (b). The reduction of tan\u03b4 can stem from the higher density and the decreased V O \u2219\u2219 caused by doping, which reduces the leakage current. Moreover, the substitution of BiE^{3+} with BNE^{2+} demonstrates acceptor doping, which reinforces domain walls, consequently decreasing tan\u03b4 within a specified scope. Additionally, the decreased \u03b5 r is associated with the lowered R/T phase ratio and the presence of defects, such as V O \u2219\u2219. As illustrated in (c), to further explore the relationship between the piezoelectric properties and temperature of BF-BT-xBNT ceramics, in-situ d 33 values were measured across annealing temperature range from room temperature to 450 \xb0C. As observed, the value of in-situ d 33 increases to T RFE (\u223c 80 \xb0C) rapidly and then enters a region of temperature variation with slow growth. When the temperature exceeds T RFE, the ferroelectric phase transforms into the relaxor phase, and the increased disorder leads to a reduction in the piezoelectric response. Additionally, BNT-doped ceramics has a lower T d than that of undoped ceramics, indicating that doping of BNT may damage the thermal stability of ceramics. (d) compares the d 33 and T m of the ceramics prepared in this work with those of representative BF-BT-based ceramics reported in the literature. Conversely, the BF-rich BF-BT-based ceramics exhibit high T m but limited d 33. However, practical ceramic applications demand good comprehensive electrical properties, that is, ceramics with both excellent d 33 and T m. In this study, the high values of both d 33 and T m suggest that the addition of trace amounts of BNT is an effective method for achieving high overall performance.

According to reports published , alterations in valence state of Fe ions and the presence of charged imperfections, like oxygen vacancies (V O \u2219\u2219), contribute to substantial leakage currents and dielectric losses, thus affecting piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties. Therefore, in order to evaluate the scenario of FeE^{3+}(2p) transitions and the generation of oxygen vacancies in ceramics, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted on BF-BT-xBNT ceramics, as illustrated in (e\u2013g). For x = 0.000 and 0.001 samples, there are two discernible broad asymmetric peaks associated Fe 2p 1/2 with and Fe 2p 3/2 shown in (e). The XPS spectrum of Fe 2p 3/2 exhibits two peaks situated around 709.4 eV and 710.9 eV, demonstrating the coexistence of FeE^{2+} and FeE^{3+}. Based on the fitting results, the concentrations of FeE^{3+} and FeE^{2+} were found to be in ratios of 69.5: 30.5 and 78.7: 21.3 with increase x contents, indicating that the conversion of FeE^{3+} to FeE^{2+} in the ceramic is inhibited [as illustrated in (g) and summarized in ]. This may be attributed to the substitution of FeE^{3+} by TiE^{4+}. In particular, the binding energy for x = 0.001 sample exhibited a shift towards higher values than that of the x = 0.000 sample. (f) summarizes the asymmetrical O 1 s photoelectron peaks, which are divided into three sub-peaks. For all ceramics samples, the lowest binding energy OI peak (\u223c529.5 eV) is assigned to the cation-oxygen bonds. The higher energy peaks, OII (\u223c530.3 eV) and OIII (\u223c531.4 eV), are indicative of the presence of oxygen vacancies and the absorbed H2O, respectively. Compared with the undoped ceramics, when x = 0.001, OI, OII and OIII changed from 29.8 %, 26.3 % and 43.9\u201327 %, 23 % and 50 % respectively. It is worth mentioning that as the doped BNT-content increase, the peaks area ratio representing oxygen vacancy reduced significantly while the area ratio of adsorbed oxygen increased, as shown in (g) and. The complex ion substitutions induced by BNT doping suppress the reduction of FeE^{3+}, thereby reducing the formation of oxygen vacancies. As aforementioned, it is founded that doping BNT can inhibit the change valence of FeE^{3+} and the generation of V O \u2219\u2219, thus reducing the leakage current and improving the piezoelectric properties of ceramics. T C is typically identified as the temperature at which the dielectric peak occurs in \u03b5 r - T measurement, denoted as T m. As the content of BNT increases, the dielectric peak of the BF-BT-xBNT ceramic broadens obviously, and T m gradually moves to the high temperature direction with the increase of frequency. According to previous reports , in the following discussion, we use the change of T m at 1 kHz to analyze the variation in the ceramic phase transition. The impact of BNT content on the phase transformation of BF-BT-xBNT ceramics was investigated by measuring the temperature-dependent dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) and dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) , as illustrated in (a)\u2013(d). It is clearly observed that all the ceramics exhibit a dielectric anomaly peak only around 480 \xb0C within the testing range, with no significant dielectric anomalies at other temperatures. This indicates that within the test range, the BF-BT-xBNT ceramics undergo a ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition near the T m. As shown in (f), compared to the undoped ceramics, the ceramics with x = 0.001 show almost no decrease in T m (484 \xb0C). Whereas as x increases, T m decreases to 478 \xb0C. That\u2019s because the doped non-lone pair ion replaced the lone pair ion BiE^{3+}, thus interfering with the polar coupling in the system. Moreover, the reduction of T m is significantly closely linked to the decreased R/T phase ratio , which aligns with the XRD results. The tan\u03b4 stays consistent at low temperatures and then quickly escalates as x increase. Additionally, the introduction of BNT content leads to a gradually broadened dielectric curve, implying the phase transition became increasingly diffused. To gain a deeper understanding and quantitative assessment the diffusion and relaxation characteristics of phase transitions, we employ a revised Curie-Weiss law to represent the degree of phase transition diffusiveness, as shown by the as following: where \u03b5 r is the dielectric constant, \u03b5 m is the maximum dielectric value, T m is the temperature corresponding to \u03b5 m, C is the Curie-Weiss constant, and \u03b3 is the diffuseness coefficient. Generally, \u03b3 = 1 and \u03b3 = 2 represent normal ferroelectrics and ideal relaxor, respectively, while the values of \u03b3 between 1 and 2 indicate relaxor ferroelectrics. (e) and display the fitting results of the ln (T - T m) as the independent variable versus ln (1/\u03b5 r - 1/\u03b5 m) function. The \u03b3 values increases with x, indicating the strengthened dielectric relaxation. In addition, the relaxation behavior of the ceramics can also be characterized by fitting the experimental data to the Vogel-Fulcher law, as shown in : where f is the driving frequency, f 0 is the characteristic frequency, E a is the activation energy, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T f is the freezing temperature, representing the boundary between the ergodic and non-ergodic states. With the doping of BNT, the relaxation behavior of the ceramics improves. Meanwhile, with the variation in composition, the T f of ceramic exhibits a slight decrease from 470 \xb0C to 451 \xb0C. Specifically, when x = 0.001, T f = 466 \xb0C. It may imply that the doped ceramics are still capable of maintaining a relatively high operational temperature limit. (a\u2013d) present the SEM images of the polished surfaces (a-b) and thermally etched surfaces (c-d) for BF-BT-xBNT ceramics with different amounts of BNT. When x = 0.001, the ceramics have a lower porosity. The enhanced growth of the grains can be ascribed to the increase of impurity phase Bi25FeO39 content, which forms a liquid phase and facilitates grain growth during sintering. In conclusion, the incorporation of BNT results in a gradual enlargement and greater uniformity of grain size. And micro-doping of BNT has minimal impact on porosity while aiding in enhancing the density of ceramics. The PFM technique is utilized to conduct a deeper analysis of the domain configurations in BF-BT-xBNT ceramics with different modifier concentrations. (a\u2013d) shows the vertical PFM information of the ceramics at x = 0.000 and 0.001, including amplitude and phase patterns. It's evident that the amount of BNT doping significantly impacts the size and shape of the domains in the ceramics. The ceramic sample at x = 0.000 exhibits heterogeneous domain compositions characterized by macro-scale long stripe domains, leading to an effective piezoelectric response to the tip voltage. However, the ceramic sample at x = 0.001 exhibits larger island-like domain regions and a few smaller domain regions, indicative of the T phase featuring a singular XRD peak and dielectric relaxation. The incorporation of BNT enhances particles expansion and the formation of microdomains, destroys the original regularity of domain morphology and size to a certain extent, and weakens the ferroelectric long-range order. In contrast to the x = 0.000 samples, the x = 0.001 samples exhibit larger domain structures and lower domain walls, contributing to the domain switching. The complicated domain configuration is observed from the corresponding piezo response image at x = 0.001, revealing submicron-size domain morphology. This is because the incorporation of BNT may promote the development of microdomains, and the coexistence of macrodomain and microdomain helps to maintain their rotated states, resulting in a strong piezoelectric response. Furthermore, in comparison to the undoped sample, the major domain regions in the x = 0.001 sample are oriented with upward polarization, allowing the polarization vector to easily align in the out-of-plane direction under external stimuli. This may contribute to the enhanced piezoelectric response of BNT-doped ceramics. Therefore, both the quality and quantity of the domains at x = 0.001 are significantly improved compared to the undoped ones, leading to a robust piezoelectric response, which is consistently linked with increased piezoelectricity. The local poling treatment (litho-mode) of PFM are shown in (e-h). At x = 0.000, only a limited number of domains switch at 10 V, while most switch at 20 V. In contrast, for the x = 0.001 sample, domains switch completely at a low electric voltage of 5 V, while the rotated domain region at 15 V extends beyond the area indicated by white dashed line square. Meanwhile, BNT-doped samples are more prone to domain switching, implying that BNT doping is beneficial to reduce the domain wall and increase its mobility. These findings suggest that domains in the x = 0.001 ceramic are more easily switchable than those in the x = 0.000 ceramic, which is one of key factor contributing to the enhanced electromechanical performance observed in the ceramic with x = 0.001. (a1\u2013a4) show polarization-electric field (P-E) loops of BF-BT-xBNT ceramics measured at 60 kV/cm from room temperature to 120 \xb0C. The anomalous behavior observed in BF-BT-xBNT ceramics may be related to the incomplete saturation of the ceramic\u2019s polarization. Additionally, studies have shown that this anomalous polarization behavior is associated with the weakening of antiferroelectric distortion and re-entrant relaxation behavior in BFO ceramics. At 120 \xb0C, P r decreases with x increasing, and E c increases with x increasing. This may be related to the increase of lattice distortion caused by BNT doping. Lattice distortion may affect the ferroelectric domain structure in ceramics, making it more difficult to flip polarization, resulting in an increase in P r and E c. (b1-b4) exhibit bipolar strain loops recorded at various temperatures from 30 \xb0C to 120 \xb0C. Additionally, at high temperature, the strain values of ceramics initially rise and then decline with varying x values, peaking at x = 0.001. This phenomenon indicate that BNT doping may enhance improving the ferroelectric properties of the ceramics at high temperature. (e) exhibits unipolar strain loops measured at different temperatures from 30 \xb0C to 120 \xb0C. The results show that the unipolar strain of x = 0.001 exhibits a gradual increase as temperature rises, and maintains a relatively consistent growth rate. It is noteworthy that the composition dependence of P r and E c value appears abnormal above 100 \xb0C. In addition to the lattice distortion mentioned earlier, PFM results are also consistent with this phenomenon. For the sample with x = 0.000, macro domains featuring long stripes dominate, leading to a sustained high growth rate of P r even under elevated temperatures. Conversely, a trace number of nanodomains in the sample with x = 0.001 results in a slower growth rate of P r at high temperature. Therefore, the anomalous behavior of composition-dependent P r value above room temperature is elucidated. (a) and (b) show the influence of BNT on the piezoelectric constant d 33, planar electromechanical coupling coefficient k p, dielectric constant \u03b5 r, dielectric loss tan\u03b4 and quality factor Q m values of x on the BF-BT-xBNT ceramics, measured at room temperature after 24 h of poling. (a) displays an initial increase in the values of k p and d 33, subsequently followed by a decline, reaching an optimal value near x = 0.001 (d 33 = 202 pC/N). In general, the piezoelectric properties of ferroelectrics are assessed through the following : Where Q is the temperature-independent electrostriction coefficient, \u03b5 r is the dielectric constant, and P r is the remanent polarization intensity. Therefore, the increase of d 33 in the first stage may be influenced by the increase of P r, and the subsequent decrease is due to the more drastic decrease of \u03b5 r. The BNT doping can cause the change of phase structure, resulting in decreased R/T phase ratio, which contributes to the improvement of piezoelectric properties. The dielectric loss tan\u03b4 and dielectric constant \u03b5 r decrease, and the mechanical quality factor Q m increase with the rise in x, as shown in (b). The reduction of tan\u03b4 can stem from the higher density and the decreased V O \u2219\u2219 caused by doping, which reduces the leakage current. Moreover, the substitution of BiE^{3+} with BNE^{2+} demonstrates acceptor doping, which reinforces domain walls, consequently decreasing tan\u03b4 within a specified scope. Additionally, the decreased \u03b5 r is associated with the lowered R/T phase ratio and the presence of defects, such as V O \u2219\u2219. As illustrated in (c), to further explore the relationship between the piezoelectric properties and temperature of BF-BT-xBNT ceramics, in-situ d 33 values were measured across annealing temperature range from room temperature to 450 \xb0C. As observed, the value of in-situ d 33 increases to T RFE (\u223c 80 \xb0C) rapidly and then enters a region of temperature variation with slow growth. When the temperature exceeds T RFE, the ferroelectric phase transforms into the relaxor phase, and the increased disorder leads to a reduction in the piezoelectric response. Additionally, BNT-doped ceramics has a lower T d than that of undoped ceramics, indicating that doping of BNT may damage the thermal stability of ceramics. (d) compares the d 33 and T m of the ceramics prepared in this work with those of representative BF-BT-based ceramics reported in the literature. Conversely, the BF-rich BF-BT-based ceramics exhibit high T m but limited d 33. However, practical ceramic applications demand good comprehensive electrical properties, that is, ceramics with both excellent d 33 and T m. In this study, the high values of both d 33 and T m suggest that the addition of trace amounts of BNT is an effective method for achieving high overall performance.
