Pb1-x-3y/2Bax Rey 3+ Nb2O6 (x = 0.35 and y = 0.00, 0.02, 0.04 and 0.06, ReE^{3+}=NdE^{3+})  was prepared by Solid State Reaction approach. This method involves mixing and grinding raw powdered materials (usually oxides or carbonates), followed by heating the mixture at high temperatures (typically 1000\u20131500 \xb0C) to facilitate diffusion and reaction between the components. In this work, the 99.9 % pure chemicals and powders (PbO, BaCO3, Nb2O5, and Nd2O3) from Merck were weighed and mixed in the stoichiometric ratio according to formula Pb1-x-3y/2Bax Rey 3+ Nb2O6 (ReE^{3+}= NdE^{3+}, x = 0.35 and y = 0.00\u20130.06.) as listed in. The lead loss during heat treatment at 1250 \xb0C for 2 h was balanced with 6 wt% of PbO in each composition. Methanol was added as a dispersing agent and left for 1 h to ensure uniform mixing of the powders. PVA (5 wt%) was added as a binder, with the PVA-to-ceramic powder weight ratio set to 1:20, to provide mechanical strength before pressing and sintering. The powder was then pressed into pellets using a uniaxial hydraulic press at a pressure of 150 MPa, with a holding time of 3 min to ensure sufficient compaction and green body strength before sintering. The sintering was carried out in an air atmosphere at a temperature of 1150 \xb0C for 4 h. This process led to an increase in grain size and a reduction in porosity, as observed in the SEM images. The NdE^{3+} modified and unmodified PBN ceramics samples prepared are listed in. The powder-XRD (Philips X-ray diffractometer PW-1710) (CuK\u03b1 radiation of \u03bb = 1.5405 \xc5 with Ni filter) was done and 2\u03b8 ranging from 10\xb0 to 70\xb0 in the step of 2\xb0 per min at room temperature. The parameters of XRD are compared with ICDD PDF. To calculate the crystallite size from XRD data, we can use the Debye-Scherrer Eqn. , Where: D is Crystallite size (nm), K is Scherrer constant (typically 0.9 for spherical particles), \u03bb is X-ray wavelength (CuK\u03b1 radiation, \u03bb = 1.5405 \xc5) and \u03b2 is Full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peak in radians and \u03b8 is Bragg angle of the peak in degrees. The atomic packing is determined by the X-ray density method using the relation Eqn. and Eqn. : Where n' is the number of formula units, \u03a3AC is the total cation atomic weight, \u03a3AA is the total anionic atomic weight, VC is the volume of the unit cell and NA is Avogadro's number. Archimedes\u2019 principle and the above can give the materials' experimental (\u03c1exptl) and theoretical (\u03c1theor) densities. The density of the compositions determined by Archimedes method is found to be more than 95 % to that of theoretical values. SEM - JOEL model JSM 840A gives microstructural images and 3D images by an optical microscope. The flat surfaces of the pellet were coated (JFC 1100 ion sputter) with gold to avoid the accumulation of charge at the time of application of high voltage (3 KV and 120 mA) the silver paints can be used to make the pellet as an electrode and heated at 600 E^{\xb0}C for half an hour. The Hewlett Packard LF impedance analyser-4192A is used for dielectric study. We have set the frequency at 1 KHz frequency and temperature to 450 \xb0C. The dielectric constant is then given by Eqn. : Where C, d, and A are the sample's capacitance, thickness, and surface area respectively. \u03b5 o is the permittivity of free space (8.85 \xd7 10E^{\u221212} F/m). In this work, the Belding & McLaren method was used to pool the ceramic specimens  by heating the sample temperature between 100 and 110 \xb0C in highly viscous silicon oil and applying a high DC electric field of about 20\u201330 kV/cm. The sample was used after one day to measure the piezoelectric and dielectric properties under IRE standards. d33 m gives the value of piezoelectric charge coefficient d33 at 100Hz. The piezoelectric parameters like planar coupling coefficient (kp), mechanical quality factor (Qm), charge coefficients (d31), and voltage coefficient (g31) are calculated by Eqns. , where fr and fa are Resonance and Anti-resonance frequency, and taken as 1 kHz. Co is the capacitance, \u0404o and \u0404T are the permittivity in vacuum and dielectric constant of the sample, Zm is the minimum resonance impedance, YoE is the Young's modulus which is given as in Eqn. ; where a and \u03c1 are the radius and density (kg/mE^{3}) of the disc with \u03c3 as the Poisson ratio.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The XRD patterns of the PBN and NdE^{3+} modified PBN ceramic compositions at room temperature show the single-phase tetragonal structure for all samples as shown in. The lattice constants of PBN with a = 12.505 \xc5 and c = 3.984 \xc5 well matched with reported values. The lattice parameter a (\xc5) decreases with NdE^{3+} concentration in PBN ceramic compositions. The XRD peaks match well with the JCPDS file no. C34-375. Substitution of NdE^{3+} does not affect the symmetry but affects the lattice parameters as shown in. The decrease in lattice parameters with increasing Nd concentration is due to the smaller ionic radius of Nd\xb3\u207a (0.983 \xc5) compared to the larger ions (PbE^{2}\u207a and BaE^{2}\u207a) it replaces in the PBN structure. As Nd\xb3\u207a ions substitute these larger ions, the unit cell contracts, causing a reduction in lattice parameters. The maximum value (12.505 \xc5) in PBN-1 reflects the structure before significant Nd\xb3\u207a incorporation, as shown in (a). The Rietveld's refinement pattern for the XRD data of the synthesized nanostructures for x = 0.00 is presented in. The Rietveld refinement profile of the XRD data demonstrates a good fit between the experimental data (dots) and the calculated profile (solid line). The consistent peak alignment across the different samples, along with the refined fit, confirms the phase stability of the PBN ceramics. When compared with the literature, these results are consistent with typical PBN-based ceramics, where doping with rare-earth ions such as Nd\xb3\u207a can slightly influence lattice parameters without significantly disrupting the crystalline structure. The average crystallite sizes of Pb\u2081\u208b\u2093\u208b\u2083y/\u2082Ba\u2093Re\u1d67\xb3\u207aNb\u2082O\u2086 ceramics (PBN) with Nd\xb3\u207a doping (x = 0.35, y = 0.00\u20130.06) are 22.7 nm, 22.6 nm, 23.2 and 25.11 nm respectively (listed in ), showing a gradual increase with higher Nd\xb3\u207a substitution as shown in. Comparable literature on Nd\xb3\u207a doped PBN ceramics also shows crystallite sizes typically between 20 and 30 nm, confirming that the observed growth is consistent with the behavior of Nd\xb3\u207a as a dopant enhancing grain size at higher doping levels. Yuhan  et al. reported a decrease in cell volume with neodymium-doped in Strontium Sodium Barium Niobate (SSBN) Ceramics. Cell volume in NdE^{3+} doped Lead Barium Niobate ceramic materials is found to be low in comparison to unmodified Lead Barium Niobate. Hence the contraction in cell volume is been found and it is not by the ionic radii of NdE^{3+} rare earth ions. A similar decrease in cell volume is reported by the earlier authors in rare earth ion substituted in BSN  and BSNN  ceramics. The experimental densities are found in the range of 5.78\u20135.90 g/cmE^{3} as presented in. The densities of the samples decrease with the increase of NdE^{3+} concentration in PBN. The decrease in density percentage with increasing Nd\xb3\u207a concentration from 0.00 to 0.06, can be attributed to the lower atomic mass of Nd\xb3\u207a compared to the ions it replaces (PbE^{2}\u207a and BaE^{2}\u207a). As Nd\xb3\u207a ions substitute these heavier ions, the overall mass of the unit cell decreases, leading to a reduction in the material's theoretical density. Additionally, Nd\xb3\u207a substitution may introduce lattice distortions or vacancies, further lowering the packing efficiency and contributing to the reduced density percentage. The axial ratio increases in PBN ceramics with an increase in the concentration of the NdE^{3+} dopants. The axial ratios are found to be between 1.007 and 1.009. A small axial ratio indicates that the NbO\u2086 octahedra in the TB structure experiences little distortion, maintaining a near-ideal octahedral geometry. The distortion of NbO\u2086 units affects the local electric field and piezoelectric properties. The maximum value of the lattice parameter obtained in PBN-1 is 12.505 \xc5. The highest density observed in PBN-1 composition is 5.90 g/cmE^{3}. It is evident from that with an increase of NdE^{3+} composition from 0.00 to 0.06 the density percentage decreased. Relative density is calculated as the ratio of the experimental density (\u03c1ex) to the theoretical density (\u03c1th), expressed as a percentage. As shown in the data, the relative densities of the Nd\xb3\u207a modified and unmodified PBN ceramics range from 95.0 % to 96.0 %, indicating high densification across all compositions. SEM images of unmodified PBN and NdE^{3+} modified PBN compositions and associated histograms showing the distribution of nanoparticles are shown in (a)\u2013(d). The standard deviations of the grain sizes are 0.77321, 1.57002, 0.498693, and 0.458734 respectively. Also, the grain size increased with the increase of NdE^{3+} doped in PBN ceramics. The graph of grain size with an increase of NdE^{3+} concentration is shown in. From the figure, it is clear that the maximum density and grain size were observed in the PBN-1 composition. The porosity value for PBN-1 is 0.04 and the maximum porosity achieved in PBNN-3 is 0.055. Porosity increases with NdE^{3+} content at which Pb content is decreasing on the other side as shown in (b). The atomic and weight percentages of NdE^{3+} modified and unmodified PBN ceramics are presented in. For each composition, the EDS peak positions include these characteristic X-ray peaks at different energy levels. For PBN1, Lead (Pb) has two peaks at L\u03b1: \u223c10.55 keV and M\u03b1: \u223c2.34 keV; Barium (Ba) has two peaks at L\u03b1: \u223c4.47 keV and M\u03b1: \u223c0.72 keV, Niobium (Nb) has two peaks at L\u03b1: \u223c2.16 keV and K\u03b1: \u223c16.6 keV and Oxygen (O) has a single peak at K\u03b1: \u223c0.525 keV. for PBNN2, the peaks are same as above with additional two peaks of Neodymium (Nd) at L\u03b1: \u223c5.23 keV and M\u03b1: \u223c0.98 keV. for PBNN3, it has peaks similar to the second composition but with slightly higher Nd peak intensity. For PBNN4, the Nd peaks will be more pronounced at 5.23 keV and 0.98 keV. The pattern shows that these energies are approximate and can shift slightly depending on the calibration of your EDS system. This study explores the impact of neodymium (NdE^{3+}) doping on the piezoelectric properties of PBN ceramics. The XRD patterns presented in the paper show that pure and NdE^{3+}-modified PBN ceramics exhibit a single-phase tetragonal structure, consistent with prior studies. The decrease in lattice parameter 'a' with increasing NdE^{3+} concentration aligns with findings by Rao et al., who reported similar trends in Strontium Sodium Barium Niobate (SSBN) ceramics. This decrease is attributed to the substitution of NdE^{3+} ions, which causes a contraction in cell volume, a phenomenon also observed in rare earth ion-substituted Barium Sodium Niobate (BSN) and Barium Strontium Sodium Niobate (BSNN) ceramics. There is a decrease in density with increased NdE^{3+} concentration, which falls within the range of 5.78\u20135.90 g/cm\xb3. This observation is in line with earlier studies that noted density variations in doped PBN ceramics. The dielectric properties of NdE^{3+}-doped PBN ceramics show a broad dielectric peak, with the phase transition temperature (TC) remaining consistent with reported values. The maximum piezoelectric coefficient (d33) increases with NdE^{3+} concentration, achieving a peak value of 236 pC/N for PBNN-4. SEM images indicate that NdE^{3+} doping affects the grain size and porosity of PBN ceramics. The maximum grain size and density were observed in the undoped PBN composition, while NdE^{3+} doping led to a reduction in grain size and an increase in porosity. Like, the structural consistency shown by maintaining a tetragonal structure with NdE^{3+} doping is consistent with earlier work on rare-earth-doped niobate ceramics. Similarly, the improvement in piezoelectric properties with NdE^{3+} concentration echoes results from studies on other doped piezoelectric materials. So, this paper effectively builds on existing literature by demonstrating that NdE^{3+} doping can enhance the piezoelectric properties of PBN ceramics, making them suitable for advanced device applications. This work provides valuable insights into the material properties and potential applications of NdE^{3+}-doped PBN, contributing to the broader understanding of ferroelectric and piezoelectric materials. In brief, this study describes the structural, microstructural, and piezoelectric properties of PBN (probably Pb(Nb, Zr)O3 or a similar lead-based perovskite material) and NdE^{3+} modified PBN ceramics. The piezoelectric charge coefficients d11 and d33 indicate that these materials can be used in devices that rely on piezoelectricity, such as sensors, actuators, and transducers. The increase in d11 and d33 with NdE^{3+} concentration suggests enhanced piezoelectric performance. b. The transition temperature (TC) values (350 \xb0C for undoped PBN and decreasing with NdE^{3+} doping) suggest that these materials can operate at elevated temperatures. The high piezoelectric coefficients and mechanical stability indicate potential use in precision actuators, which require accurate motion control and are used in applications like adaptive optics, nano-positioning systems, and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).

This decrease is attributed to the substitution of NdE^{3+} ions, which causes a contraction in cell volume, a phenomenon also observed in rare earth ion-substituted Barium Sodium Niobate (BSN) and Barium Strontium Sodium Niobate (BSNN) ceramics. There is a decrease in density with increased NdE^{3+} concentration, which falls within the range of 5.78\u20135.90 g/cm\xb3. This observation is in line with earlier studies that noted density variations in doped PBN ceramics. The dielectric properties of NdE^{3+}-doped PBN ceramics show a broad dielectric peak, with the phase transition temperature (TC) remaining consistent with reported values. The maximum piezoelectric coefficient (d33) increases with NdE^{3+} concentration, achieving a peak value of 236 pC/N for PBNN-4. SEM images indicate that NdE^{3+} doping affects the grain size and porosity of PBN ceramics. The maximum grain size and density were observed in the undoped PBN composition, while NdE^{3+} doping led to a reduction in grain size and an increase in porosity. Like, the structural consistency shown by maintaining a tetragonal structure with NdE^{3+} doping is consistent with earlier work on rare-earth-doped niobate ceramics. Similarly, the improvement in piezoelectric properties with NdE^{3+} concentration echoes results from studies on other doped piezoelectric materials. So, this paper effectively builds on existing literature by demonstrating that NdE^{3+} doping can enhance the piezoelectric properties of PBN ceramics, making them suitable for advanced device applications. This work provides valuable insights into the material properties and potential applications of NdE^{3+}-doped PBN, contributing to the broader understanding of ferroelectric and piezoelectric materials. In brief, this study describes the structural, microstructural, and piezoelectric properties of PBN (probably Pb(Nb, Zr)O3 or a similar lead-based perovskite material) and NdE^{3+} modified PBN ceramics. The piezoelectric charge coefficients d11 and d33 indicate that these materials can be used in devices that rely on piezoelectricity, such as sensors, actuators, and transducers. The increase in d11 and d33 with NdE^{3+} concentration suggests enhanced piezoelectric performance. b. The transition temperature (TC) values (350 \xb0C for undoped PBN and decreasing with NdE^{3+} doping) suggest that these materials can operate at elevated temperatures. The high piezoelectric coefficients and mechanical stability indicate potential use in precision actuators, which require accurate motion control and are used in applications like adaptive optics, nano-positioning systems, and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).
