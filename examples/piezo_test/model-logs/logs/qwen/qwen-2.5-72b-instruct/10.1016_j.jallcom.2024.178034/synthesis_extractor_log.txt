The nominal composition 1.0 mol% Mn-doped 0.28Pb(In1/2Nb1/2)O3-0.42Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.30PbTiO3 single crystal was grown along [001] by the modified Bridgman method , and cut into 6 \xd7 6 \xd7 0.38 mmE^{3} as unit sheets. To ensure the uniformity of PSAs, the unit sheets were extracted from the same horizontal cross-section of the single crystal boule. After annealing at 600 \u2103 for 4 hours and cleaning, ultrathin conductive gold layers with a thickness of 100 nm were deposited on the surface of unit sheets by a sputtering method. To create an electrically parallel structure, it was essential to leave 0.5 mm wide insulating margins on alternating upper and lower surfaces during the electrode plating process, as illustrated in. Then unit sheets underwent direct current polarization (DCP) along the [001] direction, with a condition of 135 \u2103, 1 kV/mm, and 10 minutes, using a CS2674 AX voltage tester in a thermostatic oil bath. The polarized unit sheets were subjected to electrical testing to provide a foundation for subsequent analysis of PSAs. The longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient (d33) was measured using a quasi-static d33 meter (ZJ-4A type). The variations in dielectric constant (\u03b5 33 T/ \u03b5 0)and dielectric loss (tan \u03b4) with temperature were measured at a frequency of 1 kHz using a precision LCR meter (Agilent E4980A). The hysteresis loop was measured using a ferroelectric test system (TF Analyzer 2000E Aix ACT System). The experimental setup for measuring the thickness displacement consists of a sample stage, a power supply, a high-voltage amplifier (Trek INC 610E-K-CE), a temperature control (TFA 448\u20138 Aix ACT Systems), and a laser sensor. The setup has the capacity to generate unidirectional strain-electric field (S-E) characteristic curves of PSAs under varying conditions. PSAs primarily consist of piezoelectric single crystal unit sheets, E-44(6101) epoxy, and zirconia ceramic sheets, as depicted in (A). Initially, 15 layers of unit sheets were bonded using epoxy in an electrical parallel and mechanical series configuration. To enhance rigidity, zirconia ceramic sheets with a thickness of 0.5 mm were affixed to the top and bottom surfaces. Subsequently, the stacked samples were subjected to a 5 MPa pressure applied longitudinally using an isostatic press. After statically curing for 48 hours, PSAs were finished with dimensions of 6 \xd7 6 \xd7 6.7 mmE^{3}, as detailed in (B). Finally, PSAs with connected wires were illustrated in (C). The internal structures of PSAs were examined using a polarized light microscope (BX51) to identify defects such as air voids, cracks, and inconsistencies in interlayer thickness. The output strain characteristics of PSAs were recorded using the same displacement measurement system employed for unit sheets. While examining electric field stability, S-E curves were recorded at room temperature, with electric field frequency (\u0192) varying from 1 Hz to 10 Hz and electric field amplitude (E0) increasing from 1.0 kV/mm to 1.5 kV/mm. When investigating temperature stability, the temperature within the sample chamber was adjusted from 25 \u2103 to 115 \u2103, with S-E curves recorded at 10 \u2103 intervals. To ensure thermal stability, the samples were maintained at each target temperature for 1 hour before measurement. The standard condition was set at 25 \u2103, 1 Hz, and 1.0 kV/mm, while the strong-field condition was set at 25 \u2103, 10 Hz, and 1.5 kV/mm.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Under small-signal testing, the poled Mn: PIMNT single crystal showed a piezoelectric coefficient d33 of 1161 pC/N, a dielectric constant \u03b5 33 T/ \u03b5 0 of 3606, and a dielectric loss tan \u03b4 of 0.24 %. The temperature dependence of the dielectric properties was subsequently measured, with the first phase transition temperature T1 occurring at 130 \u2103, as shown in (A). Below 130 \u2103, the single crystal exhibited a pure rhombohedral (R) phase , while part of the R phase transitioned into the monoclinic (M) phase between 130 \u2103 and 144 \u2103. When the temperature was over 144 \u2103, thermal activation reduced the stability of the M phase, leading to significant depolarization, which triggered a transition to the tetragonal (T) phase. Finally, the structure fully transformed into a cubic (C) phase at a transition temperature Tm of 183 \u2103. The coercive field Ec was found to be 5.14 kV/cm, determined from its ferroelectric hysteresis loop ( B). Compared with commonly used piezoelectric materials ( ), the Mn: PIMNT crystal in this study exhibited lower tan \u03b4, along with significantly higher T1 and Ec, suggesting a more stable ferroelectric domain structure. (A-B) shows optical microscope images of the side view for the PSA. At 100 X magnification, the images reveal uniform layer thickness throughout the PSA, with strong interfacial bonding and no visible defect, such as cracks or bubbles. At 400 X magnification, the adhesive layer can be clearly observed, with its thickness consistently controlled below 3 \u03bcm. (C-D) displays cross-sectional views of the PSA at 100 X and 400 X magnifications, respectively. At 100 X, the image provides a broad overview and 400 X magnification allows for detailed inspection. To analyze strain stability of unit sheets and PSAs, S-E characteristic curves were obtained respectively. The output strain (S) is defined by , and the effective piezoelectric constant( d 33 *) is determined based on , where \u0394t represents the measured displacement and t denotes the effective longitudinal height of the test subject. E0 corresponds to the applied electric field amplitude and Smax refers to the maximum strain. Additionally, the hysteresis of the output strain is expressed as , where \u0394S max is the maximum displacement difference at half of E0. The electric field stability testing results ( A) reveal a linear increase in Smax of the unit sheet with E0. Under the standard condition, the Smax of 1.15 \u2030 was achieved at E0. The temperature stability testing results ( B) indicate that Smax of the unit sheet increases as temperature rises from 25 \u2103 to 115 \u2103. At 95 \u2103, the maximum strain reached 1.72 \u2030. Within 25\u201395 \u2103 range, the strain curves maintained consistent slopes and overlapped during voltage cycling. However, as the temperature elevated to 105 \u2103, the slope changed during voltage increasing, and the curve deviated during voltage decreasing, suggesting the M phase was excited. At 115 \u2103, a secondary slope change occurred near 0.8 kV/mm, indicating intensified domain switching and phase transitions (R-M-T). Compared with T1\u223c130 \u2103 observed in (A), the phase transition under strain test was triggered earlier, attributed to the higher electric field along < 001 >. The relationship between Smax and d 33 * was used to calculate d 33 * under different conditions ( C). The results indicated that the piezoelectric property of the unit sheet was minimally affected by \u0192 and E0. Under the standard test condition, the calculated d 33 * was 1147 pm/V, closely matching the quasi-static d 33 measurement (d33\u223c1161 pC/N). As temperature increased, the growth rate of d 33 * was initially slow but then accelerated at 95 \u2103. The higher growth rate could be attributed to the introduction of the M phase, which formed a mixture of R+M phases, facilitating domain wall motion and electric dipole polarization. (A) shows the input electric field and the output strain of the PSA as a function of time under the standard condition, demonstrating a linear strain response to the applied electric field. At electric field amplitude, the Smax of 1.12 \u2030 is achieved with a 2.0 % hysteresis rate. Meanwhile, the Smax of the PSA is 97.4 % of the unit sheet, indicating a high-quality bonding process with minimal energy loss at the interface, which is consistent with the microscopy. (B) compares output strains under standard and strong-field conditions, showing an obviously larger Smax at 1.5 kV/mm (1.68 \u2030) than at 1.0 kV/mm (1.12 \u2030). (C) shows that S-E curves of the PSA maintain strong linearity across different \u0192 and E0. In (D), the PSA preserves good strain linearity up to 115 \u2103, and Smax increases gradually as temperature rises. Despite the fact that the hysteresis is low at 115 \u2103, less uniformity of the strain curve is observed as the electric field approaches 1.0 kV/mm. For safety and optimal performance, an additional strain test ( ) was conducted at 115 \u2103, 1 Hz and 0.6 kV/mm. Under the excitation condition, the Smax was 1.32 \u2030 and the hysteresis was calculated to be 3.3 % without any significant increase near the field extremes. In order to guarantee better actuation quality, the working condition at 115 \u2103 is advised to be 0.6 kV/mm with 1 Hz. The calculated d 33 * of the PSA exhibits analogous behavior to the unit sheet, as shown in (A). The consistent trend confirms that the performance of the PSA is primarily determined by the internal piezoelectric unit sheets. The d 33 *of the PSA is 1117 pm/V under the standard test condition, increasing by 38.8 % at 95 \u2103. (B) shows the hysteresis of the PSAs remains within 5 % up to 115 \u2103 and across 1.0\u20131.5 kV/mm, indicating high stability under both temperature and electric field. Taking advantages of the low hysteresis and high stability, PSAs based on Mn: PIMNT significantly outperform conventional PSAs ( ). For PSAs based on PZT or PZNN-PT piezoceramics, obvious hysteresis is exacerbated by the presence of grain boundaries, which slow the response of electric dipoles and lead to pronounced relaxation behavior. Compared with PSAs using PMNT single crystals, the superior linearity of Mn: PIMNT crystal is attributed to internal oxygen vacancies formed by acceptor Mn doping, which hinder irreversible domain wall motion, thereby reducing the contribution of extrinsic factors to piezoelectric response. These combined factors make the fabricated PSAs ideal for applications requiring precision and stability.
