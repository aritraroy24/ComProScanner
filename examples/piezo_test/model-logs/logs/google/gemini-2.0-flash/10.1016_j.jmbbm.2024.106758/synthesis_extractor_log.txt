Colemanite (Ca2B6O11\u20225(H2O)) was generously provided by ETIMADEN, Turkey. Barium titanate (BaTiO3), titanium dioxide (TiO2), iron oxide (Fe2O3), and chitosan (medium molecular weight) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Germany. Silicon carbide (dimensions: 2 cm \xd7 3 cm x 3 mm) was supplied by Civelek Porselen, Turkey. Human osteoblast cells (HObs, Cell line no. 406-05a) were sourced from the European Collection of Cell Cultures, UK. Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (1x DMEM, 1000 mg/L glucose, with sodium pyruvate, without phenol red), fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin-streptomycin L-glutamine, 1x Trypsin-EDTA (0.25% Trypsin-0.02% EDTA), and HyClone\u2122 phosphate-buffered saline were all acquired from Gibco, USA. The WST-8 cell proliferation reagent was purchased from Roche Diagnostic GmbH, CELLPRO-RO, Germany, while the alkaline phosphatase colorimetric assay kit and von Kossa staining kit were obtained from Abcam, UK. A total of 1 g colemanite, 80 mg Fe\u2082O\u2083, 500 mg BaCO\u2083, and 500 mg TiO\u2082 were mixed. The mixture was subjected to ball milling for 15 h at a rotational speed of 300 rpm. Following the ball-milling process, 2 mL of 13.8 M ammonia solution was added to the mixture, which was then ball-milled for an additional 3 min at the same rotational speed. The resulting mixture was transferred onto a silicon carbide plate (3 cm \xd7 2 cm). The ammonia solution was evaporated by heating the plate on a hot plate set to 150 \xb0C. Subsequently, the SiC plate with the residual mixture was placed into a tubular furnace (Protherm, Furnaces PTF 14/50/450). The furnace temperature was gradually increased to 1300 \xb0C and maintained for 3 h under a continuous flow of NH\u2083 gas. Upon completion of the reaction, the NH\u2083 gas flow was stopped at 975 \xb0C, and the furnace was allowed to cool to room temperature. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was performed using a Zeiss EVO40 with an accelerating voltage of 5 kV to capture detailed structural information of the samples. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was carried out with an FEI TALOS F200S. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) analysis utilized a Park System XE-100 in contact mode. Fourier Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) was performed using a Thermo NICOLET IS50 spectrometer. The measurements were conducted over a range of 4000 to 500 cm\u207bE^{1} with a resolution of 4 cm\u207bE^{1}. Raman Spectroscopy analysis was carried out using a Renishaw inVia Reflex instrument, which was equipped with a high-speed encoded stage (Streamline\u2122) and a Leica DM2500 upright microscope. The Raman measurements employed a 532 nm laser with a 10-s exposure time and a laser power of 1%. X-ray diffraction analysis was conducted using a PANalytical Empyrean diffractometer. The scan covered a 2\u03b8 range from 10.0131\xb0 to 89.9891\xb0, with a step size of 0.0260\xb0 and a scan step time of 96.3900 s. The piezoelectric properties of the composite were assessed using PFM with an NX10 AFM system. The measurements utilized PPP CONTSCPt cantilevers from Nanosensors, characterized by a resonance frequency of approximately 25 kHz, an elastic constant of 0.2 N/m, and a tip radius of less than 25 nm. The cantilevers were metal-coated with PtIr\u2085 to enable electrical measurements. Scanning was carried out with a size of 5 \xd7 5 \u03bcmE^{2} at a pixel resolution of 256 \xd7 256, with a scan rate of 0.03 Hz. The setpoint was adjusted to 76 nN. In PFM mode, an alternating current (AC) voltage of 5 V at a frequency of 17 kHz was applied to the tip, while the sample direct current (DC) bias was variable. The human osteoblast (HOb) cells (The European Collection of Cell Cultures, UK, Cell line no. 406-05a) line were cultured in Low-Glucose DMEM medium without phenol red, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% Penicillin Streptomycin (PS), and 1% L-glutamine. Cells were incubated at 37 \xb0C with 5% CO2 and 90% humidity. Cytotoxicity was evaluated using the WST-8 colorimetric method. Cells were seeded at 5 \xd7 10\xb3 per well in 96-well plates and incubated for 24 h. Cells were then exposed to the composite at concentrations ranging from 10 to 1000 \u03bcg/mL for an additional 24 h. After medium removal, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), treated with 100 \u03bcL of 5% WST-8 solution, and incubated for 2 h at 37 \xb0C. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a microplate reader (ELx 808, BioTek, USA). HOb cells were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 4 \xd7 10E^{4} cells per well. After 24 h, cells were exposed to various concentrations of the composite for an additional 24 h. Cells were harvested using 200 \u03bcL of phenol red-free trypsin, centrifuged, resuspended 200 \u03bcL of PBS, and analyzed of cellular internalization using Guava\xae easyCyte Flow Cytometry System. Chitosan scaffolds were prepared by dissolving 0.2 g of chitosan in 10 mL of 10% acetic acid at 40 \xb0C, with stirring at 1000 rpm until fully dissolved. A 200 \u03bcL of a 0.5% genipin solution in ethanol was added, and the mixture was allowed to crosslink for 3 h. For composite-embedded chitosan scaffolds, the composite was dispersed in 10 mL of 10% acetic acid solution at a concentration of 500 \u03bcg/mL, stirred for 10 min, then mixed with 0.2 g chitosan and crosslinked with 200 \u03bcL of 0.5% genipin solution for 3 h. Two milliliters of either the chitosan or chitosan-composite mixture were placed into 24-well plates, frozen at \u221280 \xb0C for 24 h, and lyophilized for 24 h. Scaffolds were coated with Au/Pd with a thickness of 15 nm before SEM imaging. Pore sizes were measured from SEM images, and an average pore size was calculated from thirty different measurements. The compressive strength of chitosan and the composite-embedded chitosan scaffolds was evaluated using an Instron 3382 tensile tester (Instron Corporation, Canton, MA). Cylindrical samples (9 mm \xd7 14 mm) were compressed at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min using a 100 N load cell. Three samples from each scaffold were weighed individually and recorded as Wdry after drying in a vacuum oven at 37 \xb0C. To measure water content, each sample was immersed in 5 mL of 1X PBS (pH 7.4) and allowed to swell for 24 h at 37 \xb0C. Additionally, another set of samples underwent ultrasound (US) stimulation three times daily for 3 s each session using a sonicator. After swelling, the samples were removed from the PBS solution, and excess surface water was gently blotted off with filter paper. The in vitro degradation rate of chitosan scaffolds was assessed by measuring weight changes in a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution with a pH of 7.4 at 37 \xb0C. Initially, the scaffolds were weighed (recorded as W0) and placed into separate falcon tubes, with three samples taken from each scaffold type. Subsequently, 5 mL of a 0.9% PBS solution (pH = 7.4) was added to the scaffolds, and the tubes were incubated at 37 \xb0C with shaking 100 rpm. A subset of scaffolds was also subjected to ultrasound (US) using a sonicator bath for 9 s daily. At specific time intervals (7, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, and 120 days), the PBS solutions were removed, and the scaffolds were washed three times with dH2O. The scaffolds were then dried in a vacuum oven at 37 \xb0C for 24 h and reweighed (recorded as WR). The weight loss percentages (recorded as WL) of the scaffolds were calculated based on the initial and final weights. Human Osteoblast (HOb) cells were used to evaluate cell proliferation and adhesion on the scaffolds. HOb cells were cultured in Low-Glucose DMEM medium without phenol red, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% Penicillin Streptomycin (PS), and 1% L-glutamine. Cell culture took place at 37 \xb0C with 5% CO2 and 90% humidity. The chitosan scaffolds were sterilized using 70% ethanol and incubated for 3 h at room temperature. Following sterilization, the scaffolds washed three times with PBS, with each wash step lasting 5 min. Afterward, the scaffolds were incubated in cell culture medium at 37 \xb0C for 24 h. After removing the medium, 500 \u03bcL of a cell suspension containing 5 \xd7 10E^{4} cells per well was seeded onto the scaffolds in 24-well low attachment plates. The cells were incubated for 28 days, with the medium being refreshed every three days. Ultrasound (US) stimulation was applied at a frequency of 40 kHz, three times per day for 21 days, with each stimulation session lasting 3 s and output power of 20 W. The duration and frequency of the US stimulation were optimized based on previously published studies, which demonstrated effective cellular responses under similar conditions (; ). At specified intervals (7, 14, and 21 days), cell culture medium was removed, and cell-seeded chitosan scaffolds were triple-washed with 1X PBS. A solution containing 0.2 \u03bcM calcein and 0.6 \u03bcM propidium iodide (PI) in 1X PBS was prepared. This dye solution was added to the cell-seeded scaffolds and incubated for 20 min at 37 \xb0C. Subsequently, the dye solution was aspirated, and the scaffolds were washed three times with 1X PBS to eliminate residual dyes. The scaffolds were then kept in PBS solution until fluorescence images were captured using a Zeiss AxioCam HR microscope. For SEM analysis at designated intervals (7, 14, 21, 28 days), the scaffolds underwent a fixation process using a 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution. Following a 30-min incubation at +4 \xb0C in the glutaraldehyde solution, the scaffolds were sequentially washed with 50%, 70%, 90%, and 100% ethanol solutions for 5 min each at room temperature. Subsequently, the scaffolds were dried at 37 \xb0C for 3 h and subjected to SEM analysis after coating with a 30 nm thickness of gold/platinum. Cell culture medium was removed, and the scaffolds were incubated in a 5% silver nitrate solution for 60 min with exposure to ultraviolet light. After rinsing in distilled water, the scaffolds were incubated in a 5% sodium thiosulfate solution for 3 min to halt the reaction. Following incubation, the scaffolds were washed, incubated in nuclear fast red solution for 5 min, and washed again. After the designated time intervals (7, 14, 21, 28 days), cell culture media were aspirated. The cell-seeded scaffolds underwent a double wash with PBS. Following this, a 200 \u03bcL Tris-Triton solution (comprising 0.1 percent Triton-X-100 in 0.1 M Tris buffer) was added to each well, allowing cells to migrate from the surface and undergo rupture. The collected Tris-Triton solutions, along with the scaffolds, were transferred to eppendorf tubes, and an additional 200 \u03bcL, followed by another 100 \u03bcL of Tris-Triton solution, were added. Subsequently, the samples were subjected to a freeze-thaw cycle by freezing at \u221280 \xb0C for 10 min and thawing at +37 \xb0C for 10 min, a process repeated three times. Each sample underwent sonication for 10 min with 30-s intervals and was then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min. The experiment was continued by employing a colorimetric ALP assay kit from Abcam, United Kingdom, following the provided kit instructions.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The aim of this study was to formulate a hybrid composite structure, BaTiO3/BNNT, aimed at augmenting the inherent piezoelectricity of BNNTs, while capitalizing on their commendable chemical, physical, mechanical, and biological characteristics. The conceptualization of this hybrid composite was grounded in the methodical synthesis of these two nanomaterials, BNNT and BaTiO3, employing similar processing conditions, specifically involving a preliminary ball milling process followed by high-temperature annealing (; ). Synthesis of BNNT and BaTiO3 was successfully achieved on a SiC plate utilizing a Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) technique, constituting what is herein referred to as the \u2018composite.' The required precursors for BNNT synthesis, namely colemanite and Fe2O3 catalyst, were amalgamated with barium carbonate (BaCO3) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) compounds. Following a 15-h ball milling process designed to reduce precursor size, enhance specific surface area, and optimize stored energy, the resulting mixture suspended in an NH3 solution was deposited onto a SiC plate. Subsequently, the assembly was introduced into the core of a tubular furnace, where the reaction unfolded at 1300 \xb0C for a duration of 3 h under the NH3 gas atmosphere. The NH3 gas flow was deliberately halted when the furnace temperature reached 975 \xb0C to promote the formation of BaTiO3, culminating in the collection of the composite from the SiC plate. The formation of the composite was initially investigated SEM, as seen in. In a comparative study with the same quantities of colemanite and catalyst as in a prior to BNNTs synthesis (1 g colemanite: 80 mg Fe2O3), and varying quantities of BaCO3 and TiO2, distinct morphologies were observed. When BaCO3 and TiO2 were maintained at 100 mg each, structures resembling BaTiO3 were predominantly present, yet no discernible BNNT formations were evident (a). Upon increasing the amounts of BaCO3 and TiO2 to 250 mg, BNNT structures commenced to emerge (b). Notably, when the quantities of BaCO3 and TiO2 were reduced to half of the colemanite amount, a more substantial presence of BNNT structures was achieved (c). Concurrently, BaTiO3 formations were subtly observed at the base of BNNT structures. The augmentation of BaCO3 and TiO2 quantities corresponded to an increased occurrence of BNNT formations, attributed to their catalytic influence on BNNT growth. However, when BaCO3 and TiO2 quantities equaled that of colemanite, exclusively BaTiO3 structures were observed (d). Based on SEM results, the composite synthesized from 1 g colemanite, 80 mg Fe2O3, 500 mg BaCO3, and 500 mg TiO2 was deemed the most suitable precursor ratio. In the SEM images obtained from a solid composite sample, BaTiO3 structures were not distinctly visible due to the extensive presence of BNNT formations on the surface. This facilitated the examination of BaTiO3 structures using AFM (f). In addition to the evident formation of BaTiO3 and BNNTs, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, as illustrated in , revealed the presence of various other boron nitride structures. The structural analysis of the composite was identified by FTIR, Raman spectroscopy, and XRD as depicted in. In FTIR spectrum of the composite, the peaks corresponded to characteristic peaks of BNNT were observed at 1347 and 756 cmE^{\u22121} (a). Certain shifts were observed in FTIR spectrum of the composite compared to the FTIR spectrum of BNNTs, which may be due to the BaTiO3 and other structural formations on the same synthesis plate. Characteristic peaks of BaTiO3 were not clearly observed due to suppression by broad and shallow peaks of BNNTs. The BNNTs typically give a sharp peak at 1367 cmE^{\u22121}. This peak shows the E2g plane model of the h-BN network and originates from the atomic vibration between the B and N atoms on the same plane. The peaks corresponding to BaTiO3 were observed at 714 cmE^{\u22121} while tetragonal BaTiO3 have four characteristic Raman peaks at about 261, 304, 517 and 715 cmE^{\u22121} as reported in the literature. It was also observed the peaks at 248, 282, 405 and 564 cmE^{\u22121}. These peaks could be attributed to the characteristic peaks of BaTiO3. However, there are some shifts at that wavenumbers compared to the peak values of BaTiO3 remarked in the literature. This shift in the Raman spectrum of composite as indicated in b could be due to the synthesis of BaTiO3 in the presence of colemanite, Fe2O3 and NH3 gas to obtain composite. Furthermore, the Raman spectrum and XRD plot (c) of the composite revealed the presence of different structural formations beyond BaTiO3 and BNNT in the synthesized composite. The XRD patterns of the composite displayed distinct diffraction peaks at 2\u03b8 values of 22.39\xb0, 31.72\xb0, 39.09\xb0, 56.62\xb0, 65.53\xb0, 66.53\xb0, 73.96\xb0, and 78.74\xb0, which correspond to the tetragonal structure of BaTiO\u2083 (JCPDS data No. 05\u20130626). Notably, the split peaks at approximately 44.8\xb0 and 45.5\xb0 are indicative of the tetragonal phase of BaTiO\u2083, which is crucial for its piezoelectric properties. In addition, the presence of diffraction peaks at 2\u03b8 = 27.03\xb0, 44.71\xb0, 59.14\xb0, and 82.32\xb0 confirms the formation of BNNTs (JCPDS Card no. 85\u20131068). The clear identification of these peaks aligns with previously reported BNNT structures, reinforcing the composite's successful fabrication. Beyond BaTiO\u2083 and BNNTs, the XRD plot also revealed additional peaks that suggest the formation of barium titanium bis borate (B\u2082Ba\u2086TiO\u2086) and titanium nitrogen boron (Ti\u2084N\u2083B\u2082) phases. Despite these secondary structures, the predominant phases remained BaTiO\u2083 and BNNT, both of which are known for their piezoelectric properties. According to the ICP-MS results, element concentrations in colemanite are higher than in all other samples except Fe. Washing of the composite with formic acid also caused the removal of carbonate residues. displays PFM analysis results of the composite material. The topography image highlights a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 0.47 \u03bcm and a peak-to-valley roughness of 2.7 \u03bcm, providing insights into the surface texture that may influence the piezoelectric behavior. The amplitude (b) and phase images (c) obtained through PFM for the composite material, alongside a topography image that reveals the surface characteristics. In comparison to the results for BNNTs in our previous report , the composite exhibited a higher and more pronounced PFM amplitude contrast, measured at 0.83 mV. The material undergoes polarization under the influence of an external electric field (AC), leading to expansion or contraction in response. As anticipated, variations in piezo-response were observed, given the composite's predominant composition of BNNTs and BaTiO\u2083. The PFM phase contrast exhibited a relatively weaker signal, indicating diverse polarities within different domains of the material. Furthermore, the piezoelectric properties of the composite material were evaluated using vertical (e) and lateral PFM (c) signals. The contrast observed in the vertical PFM signal indicates that adjacent layers within the material exhibit different piezoelectric responses. By acquiring the lateral PFM signal on the same area as the vertical PFM signal, it is gained additional insights into the piezoelectric response in multiple directions. Furthermore, the ability to switch the vertical PFM signal by applying either a positive or negative sample bias highlights the material's capacity for polarization reversal, which is another key indicator of piezoelectricity. The cytotoxicity of the composite on HOb cells was assessed with WST-8 colorimetric assay. In the experiment, HOb cells were subjected to the composite at varying concentrations for 24 h and the impact of nanomaterial on cell viability was investigated ( a). Cellular uptake of the composite was also evaluated on HOb cells using flow cytometry, revealing a significant increase in uptake with increasing concentrations compared to the control cells (b). Chitosan scaffolds were fabricated using the freeze-drying technique, enabling the creation of highly interconnected porous matrices, as illustrated by the SEM images in a and b. The pore size of the genipin-crosslinked chitosan scaffold ranged from 40 \u03bcm to 100 \u03bcm (a). The SEM images in emphasize the remarkably porous structure of chitosan-based scaffolds. The swelling ratio of chitosan was measured at 9.28 with US stimulation and 9.65 without US stimulation (d). For the chitosan-composite, the swelling ratio was measured at 6.63 without US stimulation and 8.81 with US stimulation. The compressive strength for chitosan was measured at 0.0367 MPa, whereas the chitosan-composite exhibited a higher compressive strength of 0.0536 MPa. The Young's modulus values for chitosan and chitosan-composite were 0.009 MPa and 0.0106 MPa, respectively. The compressive stress for chitosan was measured at 0.080 MPa, whereas the chitosan-composite exhibited a higher compressive stress of 0.095 MPa. The weight loss profiles, represented as a percentage versus time, for chitosan and composite-embedded chitosan scaffolds with and without US stimulation are presented in f over various time intervals. At the conclusion of the 120-day period, the weight loss percentages for chitosan and chitosan-composite were 36.17% and 28.61%, respectively. US stimulation did not significantly alter the degradation profile of chitosan scaffolds compared to those without US stimulation, with weight loss percentages at the end of 120 days measured at 35.48% and 29.09% for chitosan and chitosan-composite, respectively. The migration of HOb cells within chitosan scaffolds is evident in the fluorescence microscopy images presented in. The observed migration of HOb cells on chitosan scaffolds can be attributed to the larger pore sizes inherent in these scaffolds. Notably, green fluorescence predominantly emanated from beneath the surface of the chitosan scaffold until day 14. Subsequently, after 21 days of incubation, HOb cells were observed on the surface of the designed chitosan scaffolds. Furthermore, the cell population on US-stimulated scaffolds demonstrated an increase compared to scaffolds not subjected to US stimulation at the 21-day time point, as evident in the fluorescence images. Mean fluorescence intensities were specifically determined for day 21 samples, as at other incubation times, cells had generally migrated through the scaffolds, rendering them not readily observable on the surface. The application of US stimulation generated electric signals, facilitated by the piezoelectric features of the composite within chitosan. This contributed to the attachment and growth of electric-responsive HOb cells. By the end of day 21, a greater presence of cells was observed on chitosan scaffolds subjected to US stimulation compared to those without US stimulation. This effect can be ascribed to the mechanotaxis of cells promoted by US stimulation. To explore the morphology, attachment, and proliferation characteristics of HOb cells on chitosan scaffolds, SEM analysis was conducted at 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th days, as represented in. Although chitosan triggers the formation of bone mineralization, the minerals formed on composite embedded chitosan scaffolds were considerably higher when subjected to US stimulation. In addition, US stimulation increased cell attachment and proliferation at the time intervals of 14th, 21st and 28th days. By day 28, a distinct presence of cells was observed on the chitosan scaffold, consistent with the findings from the Live/Dead assay. illustrates the alkaline phosphatase activities (ALP) of chitosan and composite-embedded scaffolds, both with and without ultrasound stimulation (US). ALP, an essential membrane-bound tetrameric enzyme ubiquitously present in the body, is linked to glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol moieties on the outer cell surface, and it plays a pivotal role in osteoid formation and bone mineralization. The ALP activity reached its peak on day 3, showing comparable levels across all scaffold types. The ALP levels in the chitosan scaffold remained relatively consistent at day 14 and 21 compared to day 7. Notably, ALP activity was consistently higher in all scaffold types compared to chitosan alone from day 7\u201321. HOb cells on chitosan scaffolds responded to US stimulation, indicating heightened ALP activities over the 28-day period. Furthermore, a notable rise in ALP concentration was observed in US-stimulated chitosan-composite scaffolds compared to their non-stimulated counterparts on day 21. When compared with Chitosan-US, a significant increase was observed on the 7th and 21st days in Chitosan-composite-US. Mineral depositions on chitosan scaffolds, along with US-stimulated chitosan scaffolds, were visualized using von Kossa staining. Digital images of all scaffolds were captured for observation, providing front and back views of stained chitosan scaffolds with and without US stimulation on day 7, 14, 21, and 28 ( ). In , both front and back images reveal that composite-embedded chitosan scaffolds, with and without US stimulation, appeared darker compared to chitosan scaffolds alone on day 7. The front images of US-stimulated chitosan scaffolds grew darker with each passing day compared to non-stimulated scaffolds; a trend potentially linked to the ALP activity results. HOb cells exhibited a response to mechanical stimulation, contributing to increased mineral deposits. On the 14th day, front images of US-stimulated chitosan-composite scaffolds displayed more darkness compared to non-stimulated scaffolds. Both front and back images exhibited heightened darkness in US-stimulated chitosan-composite scaffolds on day 21. By day 28, all US-stimulated scaffolds appeared darker than those not stimulated, suggesting an ongoing positive influence of mechanical stimulation on mineral deposition.

The WST-8 cell proliferation reagent was purchased from Roche Diagnostic GmbH, CELLPRO-RO, Germany, while the alkaline phosphatase colorimetric assay kit and von Kossa staining kit were obtained from Abcam, UK. A total of 1 g colemanite, 80 mg Fe\u2082O\u2083, 500 mg BaCO\u2083, and 500 mg TiO\u2082 were mixed. The mixture was subjected to ball milling for 15 h at a rotational speed of 300 rpm. Following the ball-milling process, 2 mL of 13.8 M ammonia solution was added to the mixture, which was then ball-milled for an additional 3 min at the same rotational speed. The resulting mixture was transferred onto a silicon carbide plate (3 cm \xd7 2 cm). The ammonia solution was evaporated by heating the plate on a hot plate set to 150 \xb0C.

The measurements utilized PPP CONTSCPt cantilevers from Nanosensors, characterized by a resonance frequency of approximately 25 kHz, an elastic constant of 0.2 N/m, and a tip radius of less than 25 nm. The cantilevers were metal-coated with PtIr\u2085 to enable electrical measurements. Scanning was carried out with a size of 5 \xd7 5 \u03bcmE^{2} at a pixel resolution of 256 \xd7 256, with a scan rate of 0.03 Hz. The setpoint was adjusted to 76 nN. In PFM mode, an alternating current (AC) voltage of 5 V at a frequency of 17 kHz was applied to the tip, while the sample direct current (DC) bias was variable. The human osteoblast (HOb) cells (The European Collection of Cell Cultures, UK, Cell line no. 406-05a) line were cultured in Low-Glucose DMEM medium without phenol red, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% Penicillin Streptomycin (PS), and 1% L-glutamine. Cells were incubated at 37 \xb0C with 5% CO2 and 90% humidity. Cytotoxicity was evaluated using the WST-8 colorimetric method. Cells were seeded at 5 \xd7 10\xb3 per well in 96-well plates and incubated for 24 h. Cells were then exposed to the composite at concentrations ranging from 10 to 1000 \u03bcg/mL for an additional 24 h. After medium removal, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), treated with 100 \u03bcL of 5% WST-8 solution, and incubated for 2 h at 37 \xb0C. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a microplate reader (ELx 808, BioTek, USA). HOb cells were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 4 \xd7 10E^{4} cells per well. After 24 h, cells were exposed to various concentrations of the composite for an additional 24 h. Cells were harvested using 200 \u03bcL of phenol red-free trypsin, centrifuged, resuspended 200 \u03bcL of PBS, and analyzed of cellular internalization using Guava\xae easyCyte Flow Cytometry System. Chitosan scaffolds were prepared by dissolving 0.2 g of chitosan in 10 mL of 10% acetic acid at 40 \xb0C, with stirring at 1000 rpm until fully dissolved. A 200 \u03bcL of a 0.5% genipin solution in ethanol was added, and the mixture was allowed to crosslink for 3 h. For composite-embedded chitosan scaffolds, the composite was dispersed in 10 mL of 10% acetic acid solution at a concentration of 500 \u03bcg/mL, stirred for 10 min, then mixed with 0.2 g chitosan and crosslinked with 200 \u03bcL of 0.5% genipin solution for 3 h. Two milliliters of either the chitosan or chitosan-composite mixture were placed into 24-well plates, frozen at \u221280 \xb0C for 24 h, and lyophilized for 24 h. Scaffolds were coated with Au/Pd with a thickness of 15 nm before SEM imaging. Pore sizes were measured from SEM images, and an average pore size was calculated from thirty different measurements. The compressive strength of chitosan and the composite-embedded chitosan scaffolds was evaluated using an Instron 3382 tensile tester (Instron Corporation, Canton, MA). Cylindrical samples (9 mm \xd7 14 mm) were compressed at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min using a 100 N load cell. Three samples from each scaffold were weighed individually and recorded as Wdry after drying in a vacuum oven at 37 \xb0C. To measure water content, each sample was immersed in 5 mL of 1X PBS (pH 7.4) and allowed to swell for 24 h at 37 \xb0C. Additionally, another set of samples underwent ultrasound (US) stimulation three times daily for 3 s each session using a sonicator. After swelling, the samples were removed from the PBS solution, and excess surface water was gently blotted off with filter paper. The in vitro degradation rate of chitosan scaffolds was assessed by measuring weight changes in a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution with a pH of 7.4 at 37 \xb0C. Initially, the scaffolds were weighed (recorded as W0) and placed into separate falcon tubes, with three samples taken from each scaffold type. Subsequently, 5 mL of a 0.9% PBS solution (pH = 7.4) was added to the scaffolds, and the tubes were incubated at 37 \xb0C with shaking 100 rpm. A subset of scaffolds was also subjected to ultrasound (US) using a sonicator bath for 9 s daily. At specific time intervals (7, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, and 120 days), the PBS solutions were removed, and the scaffolds were washed three times with dH2O. The scaffolds were then dried in a vacuum oven at 37 \xb0C for 24 h and reweighed (recorded as WR). The weight loss percentages (recorded as WL) of the scaffolds were calculated based on the initial and final weights. Human Osteoblast (HOb) cells were used to evaluate cell proliferation and adhesion on the scaffolds. HOb cells were cultured in Low-Glucose DMEM medium without phenol red, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% Penicillin Streptomycin (PS), and 1% L-glutamine. Cell culture took place at 37 \xb0C with 5% CO2 and 90% humidity. The chitosan scaffolds were sterilized using 70% ethanol and incubated for 3 h at room temperature. Following sterilization, the scaffolds washed three times with PBS, with each wash step lasting 5 min. Afterward, the scaffolds were incubated in cell culture medium at 37 \xb0C for 24 h. After removing the medium, 500 \u03bcL of a cell suspension containing 5 \xd7 10E^{4} cells per well was seeded onto the scaffolds in 24-well low attachment plates. The cells were incubated for 28 days, with the medium being refreshed every three days. Ultrasound (US) stimulation was applied at a frequency of 40 kHz, three times per day for 21 days, with each stimulation session lasting 3 s and output power of 20 W. The duration and frequency of the US stimulation were optimized based on previously published studies, which demonstrated effective cellular responses under similar conditions (; ). At specified intervals (7, 14, and 21 days), cell culture medium was removed, and cell-seeded chitosan scaffolds were triple-washed with 1X PBS. A solution containing 0.2 \u03bcM calcein and 0.6 \u03bcM propidium iodide (PI) in 1X PBS was prepared. This dye solution was added to the cell-seeded scaffolds and incubated for 20 min at 37 \xb0C. Subsequently, the dye solution was aspirated, and the scaffolds were washed three times with 1X PBS to eliminate residual dyes. The scaffolds were then kept in PBS solution until fluorescence images were captured using a Zeiss AxioCam HR microscope. For SEM analysis at designated intervals (7, 14, 21, 28 days), the scaffolds underwent a fixation process using a 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution. Following a 30-min incubation at +4 \xb0C in the glutaraldehyde solution, the scaffolds were sequentially washed with 50%, 70%, 90%, and 100% ethanol solutions for 5 min each at room temperature. Subsequently, the scaffolds were dried at 37 \xb0C for 3 h and subjected to SEM analysis after coating with a 30 nm thickness of gold/platinum. Cell culture medium was removed, and the scaffolds were incubated in a 5% silver nitrate solution for 60 min with exposure to ultraviolet light. After rinsing in distilled water, the scaffolds were incubated in a 5% sodium thiosulfate solution for 3 min to halt the reaction. Following incubation, the scaffolds were washed, incubated in nuclear fast red solution for 5 min, and washed again. After the designated time intervals (7, 14, 21, 28 days), cell culture media were aspirated. The cell-seeded scaffolds underwent a double wash with PBS. Following this, a 200 \u03bcL Tris-Triton solution (comprising 0.1 percent Triton-X-100 in 0.1 M Tris buffer) was added to each well, allowing cells to migrate from the surface and undergo rupture. The collected Tris-Triton solutions, along with the scaffolds, were transferred to eppendorf tubes, and an additional 200 \u03bcL, followed by another 100 \u03bcL of Tris-Triton solution, were added. Subsequently, the samples were subjected to a freeze-thaw cycle by freezing at \u221280 \xb0C for 10 min and thawing at +37 \xb0C for 10 min, a process repeated three times. Each sample underwent sonication for 10 min with 30-s intervals and was then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min. The experiment was continued by employing a colorimetric ALP assay kit from Abcam, United Kingdom, following the provided kit instructions.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The aim of this study was to formulate a hybrid composite structure, BaTiO3/BNNT, aimed at augmenting the inherent piezoelectricity of BNNTs, while capitalizing on their commendable chemical, physical, mechanical, and biological characteristics. The conceptualization of this hybrid composite was grounded in the methodical synthesis of these two nanomaterials, BNNT and BaTiO3, employing similar processing conditions, specifically involving a preliminary ball milling process followed by high-temperature annealing (; ). Synthesis of BNNT and BaTiO3 was successfully achieved on a SiC plate utilizing a Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) technique, constituting what is herein referred to as the \u2018composite.' The required precursors for BNNT synthesis, namely colemanite and Fe2O3 catalyst, were amalgamated with barium carbonate (BaCO3) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) compounds. Following a 15-h ball milling process designed to reduce precursor size, enhance specific surface area, and optimize stored energy, the resulting mixture suspended in an NH3 solution was deposited onto a SiC plate. Subsequently, the assembly was introduced into the core of a tubular furnace, where the reaction unfolded at 1300 \xb0C for a duration of 3 h under the NH3 gas atmosphere. The NH3 gas flow was deliberately halted when the furnace temperature reached 975 \xb0C to promote the formation of BaTiO3, culminating in the collection of the composite from the SiC plate. The formation of the composite was initially investigated SEM, as seen in. In a comparative study with the same quantities of colemanite and catalyst as in a prior to BNNTs synthesis (1 g colemanite: 80 mg Fe2O3), and varying quantities of BaCO3 and TiO2, distinct morphologies were observed. When BaCO3 and TiO2 were maintained at 100 mg each, structures resembling BaTiO3 were predominantly present, yet no discernible BNNT formations were evident (a). Upon increasing the amounts of BaCO3 and TiO2 to 250 mg, BNNT structures commenced to emerge (b). Notably, when the quantities of BaCO3 and TiO2 were reduced to half of the colemanite amount, a more substantial presence of BNNT structures was achieved (c). Concurrently, BaTiO3 formations were subtly observed at the base of BNNT structures. The augmentation of BaCO3 and TiO2 quantities corresponded to an increased occurrence of BNNT formations, attributed to their catalytic influence on BNNT growth. However, when BaCO3 and TiO2 quantities equaled that of colemanite, exclusively BaTiO3 structures were observed (d). Based on SEM results, the composite synthesized from 1 g colemanite, 80 mg Fe2O3, 500 mg BaCO3, and 500 mg TiO2 was deemed the most suitable precursor ratio. In the SEM images obtained from a solid composite sample, BaTiO3 structures were not distinctly visible due to the extensive presence of BNNT formations on the surface. This facilitated the examination of BaTiO3 structures using AFM (f). In addition to the evident formation of BaTiO3 and BNNTs, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, as illustrated in , revealed the presence of various other boron nitride structures. The structural analysis of the composite was identified by FTIR, Raman spectroscopy, and XRD as depicted in. In FTIR spectrum of the composite, the peaks corresponded to characteristic peaks of BNNT were observed at 1347 and 756 cmE^{\u22121} (a). Certain shifts were observed in FTIR spectrum of the composite compared to the FTIR spectrum of BNNTs, which may be due to the BaTiO3 and other structural formations on the same synthesis plate. Characteristic peaks of BaTiO3 were not clearly observed due to suppression by broad and shallow peaks of BNNTs. The BNNTs typically give a sharp peak at 1367 cmE^{\u22121}. This peak shows the E2g plane model of the h-BN network and originates from the atomic vibration between the B and N atoms on the same plane. The peaks corresponding to BaTiO3 were observed at 714 cmE^{\u22121} while tetragonal BaTiO3 have four characteristic Raman peaks at about 261, 304, 517 and 715 cmE^{\u22121} as reported in the literature. It was also observed the peaks at 248, 282, 405 and 564 cmE^{\u22121}. These peaks could be attributed to the characteristic peaks of BaTiO3. However, there are some shifts at that wavenumbers compared to the peak values of BaTiO3 remarked in the literature. This shift in the Raman spectrum of composite as indicated in b could be due to the synthesis of BaTiO3 in the presence of colemanite, Fe2O3 and NH3 gas to obtain composite. Furthermore, the Raman spectrum and XRD plot (c) of the composite revealed the presence of different structural formations beyond BaTiO3 and BNNT in the synthesized composite. The XRD patterns of the composite displayed distinct diffraction peaks at 2\u03b8 values of 22.39\xb0, 31.72\xb0, 39.09\xb0, 56.62\xb0, 65.53\xb0, 66.53\xb0, 73.96\xb0, and 78.74\xb0, which correspond to the tetragonal structure of BaTiO\u2083 (JCPDS data No. 05\u20130626). Notably, the split peaks at approximately 44.8\xb0 and 45.5\xb0 are indicative of the tetragonal phase of BaTiO\u2083, which is crucial for its piezoelectric properties. In addition, the presence of diffraction peaks at 2\u03b8 = 27.03\xb0, 44.71\xb0, 59.14\xb0, and 82.32\xb0 confirms the formation of BNNTs (JCPDS Card no. 85\u20131068). The clear identification of these peaks aligns with previously reported BNNT structures, reinforcing the composite's successful fabrication. Beyond BaTiO\u2083 and BNNTs, the XRD plot also revealed additional peaks that suggest the formation of barium titanium bis borate (B\u2082Ba\u2086TiO\u2086) and titanium nitrogen boron (Ti\u2084N\u2083B\u2082) phases. Despite these secondary structures, the predominant phases remained BaTiO\u2083 and BNNT, both of which are known for their piezoelectric properties. According to the ICP-MS results, element concentrations in colemanite are higher than in all other samples except Fe. Washing of the composite with formic acid also caused the removal of carbonate residues. displays PFM analysis results of the composite material. The topography image highlights a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 0.47 \u03bcm and a peak-to-valley roughness of 2.7 \u03bcm, providing insights into the surface texture that may influence the piezoelectric behavior. The amplitude (b) and phase images (c) obtained through PFM for the composite material, alongside a topography image that reveals the surface characteristics. In comparison to the results for BNNTs in our previous report , the composite exhibited a higher and more pronounced PFM amplitude contrast, measured at 0.83 mV. The material undergoes polarization under the influence of an external electric field (AC), leading to expansion or contraction in response. As anticipated, variations in piezo-response were observed, given the composite's predominant composition of BNNTs and BaTiO\u2083. The PFM phase contrast exhibited a relatively weaker signal, indicating diverse polarities within different domains of the material. Furthermore, the piezoelectric properties of the composite material were evaluated using vertical (e) and lateral PFM (c) signals. The contrast observed in the vertical PFM signal indicates that adjacent layers within the material exhibit different piezoelectric responses. By acquiring the lateral PFM signal on the same area as the vertical PFM signal, it is gained additional insights into the piezoelectric response in multiple directions. Furthermore, the ability to switch the vertical PFM signal by applying either a positive or negative sample bias highlights the material's capacity for polarization reversal, which is another key indicator of piezoelectricity. The cytotoxicity of the composite on HOb cells was assessed with WST-8 colorimetric assay. In the experiment, HOb cells were subjected to the composite at varying concentrations for 24 h and the impact of nanomaterial on cell viability was investigated ( a). Cellular uptake of the composite was also evaluated on HOb cells using flow cytometry, revealing a significant increase in uptake with increasing concentrations compared to the control cells (b). Chitosan scaffolds were fabricated using the freeze-drying technique, enabling the creation of highly interconnected porous matrices, as illustrated by the SEM images in a and b. The pore size of the genipin-crosslinked chitosan scaffold ranged from 40 \u03bcm to 100 \u03bcm (a). The SEM images in emphasize the remarkably porous structure of chitosan-based scaffolds. The swelling ratio of chitosan was measured at 9.28 with US stimulation and 9.65 without US stimulation (d). For the chitosan-composite, the swelling ratio was measured at 6.63 without US stimulation and 8.81 with US stimulation. The compressive strength for chitosan was measured at 0.0367 MPa, whereas the chitosan-composite exhibited a higher compressive strength of 0.0536 MPa. The Young's modulus values for chitosan and chitosan-composite were 0.009 MPa and 0.0106 MPa, respectively. The compressive stress for chitosan was measured at 0.080 MPa, whereas the chitosan-composite exhibited a higher compressive stress of 0.095 MPa. The weight loss profiles, represented as a percentage versus time, for chitosan and composite-embedded chitosan scaffolds with and without US stimulation are presented in f over various time intervals. At the conclusion of the 120-day period, the weight loss percentages for chitosan and chitosan-composite were 36.17% and 28.61%, respectively. US stimulation did not significantly alter the degradation profile of chitosan scaffolds compared to those without US stimulation, with weight loss percentages at the end of 120 days measured at 35.48% and 29.09% for chitosan and chitosan-composite, respectively. The migration of HOb cells within chitosan scaffolds is evident in the fluorescence microscopy images presented in. The observed migration of HOb cells on chitosan scaffolds can be attributed to the larger pore sizes inherent in these scaffolds. Notably, green fluorescence predominantly emanated from beneath the surface of the chitosan scaffold until day 14. Subsequently, after 21 days of incubation, HOb cells were observed on the surface of the designed chitosan scaffolds. Furthermore, the cell population on US-stimulated scaffolds demonstrated an increase compared to scaffolds not subjected to US stimulation at the 21-day time point, as evident in the fluorescence images. Mean fluorescence intensities were specifically determined for day 21 samples, as at other incubation times, cells had generally migrated through the scaffolds, rendering them not readily observable on the surface. The application of US stimulation generated electric signals, facilitated by the piezoelectric features of the composite within chitosan. This contributed to the attachment and growth of electric-responsive HOb cells. By the end of day 21, a greater presence of cells was observed on chitosan scaffolds subjected to US stimulation compared to those without US stimulation. This effect can be ascribed to the mechanotaxis of cells promoted by US stimulation. To explore the morphology, attachment, and proliferation characteristics of HOb cells on chitosan scaffolds, SEM analysis was conducted at 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th days, as represented in. Although chitosan triggers the formation of bone mineralization, the minerals formed on composite embedded chitosan scaffolds were considerably higher when subjected to US stimulation. In addition, US stimulation increased cell attachment and proliferation at the time intervals of 14th, 21st and 28th days. By day 28, a distinct presence of cells was observed on the chitosan scaffold, consistent with the findings from the Live/Dead assay. illustrates the alkaline phosphatase activities (ALP) of chitosan and composite-embedded scaffolds, both with and without ultrasound stimulation (US). ALP, an essential membrane-bound tetrameric enzyme ubiquitously present in the body, is linked to glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol moieties on the outer cell surface, and it plays a pivotal role in osteoid formation and bone mineralization. The ALP activity reached its peak on day 3, showing comparable levels across all scaffold types. The ALP levels in the chitosan scaffold remained relatively consistent at day 14 and 21 compared to day 7. Notably, ALP activity was consistently higher in all scaffold types compared to chitosan alone from day 7\u201321. HOb cells on chitosan scaffolds responded to US stimulation, indicating heightened ALP activities over the 28-day period. Furthermore, a notable rise in ALP concentration was observed in US-stimulated chitosan-composite scaffolds compared to their non-stimulated counterparts on day 21. When compared with Chitosan-US, a significant increase was observed on the 7th and 21st days in Chitosan-composite-US. Mineral depositions on chitosan scaffolds, along with US-stimulated chitosan scaffolds, were visualized using von Kossa staining. Digital images of all scaffolds were captured for observation, providing front and back views of stained chitosan scaffolds with and without US stimulation on day 7, 14, 21, and 28 ( ). In , both front and back images reveal that composite-embedded chitosan scaffolds, with and without US stimulation, appeared darker compared to chitosan scaffolds alone on day 7. The front images of US-stimulated chitosan scaffolds grew darker with each passing day compared to non-stimulated scaffolds; a trend potentially linked to the ALP activity results. HOb cells exhibited a response to mechanical stimulation, contributing to increased mineral deposits. On the 14th day, front images of US-stimulated chitosan-composite scaffolds displayed more darkness compared to non-stimulated scaffolds. Both front and back images exhibited heightened darkness in US-stimulated chitosan-composite scaffolds on day 21. By day 28, all US-stimulated scaffolds appeared darker than those not stimulated, suggesting an ongoing positive influence of mechanical stimulation on mineral deposition.
