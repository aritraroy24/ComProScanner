Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'Solid State Reaction', 'precursors': ['PbO', 'BaCO3', 'Nb2O5', 'Nd2O3'], 'steps': ['Weighing and mixing powders in stoichiometric ratio', 'Adding methanol as a dispersing agent and mixing for 1 h', 'Adding PVA (5 wt%) as a binder (PVA-to-ceramic powder weight ratio 1:20)', 'Pressing into pellets using a uniaxial hydraulic press at 150 MPa for 3 min', 'Sintering in air at 1150 °C for 4 h'], 'characterization_techniques': ['Powder-XRD', 'SEM', 'Optical microscope', 'Archimedes method', 'EDS', 'LF impedance analyser', 'Piezoelectric charge coefficient d33 measurement']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
