<110>c-oriented 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 (x=0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5) single crystals were fabricated by an SSCG method. The raw powders of (Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3 (0.6 \xb5m, Nippon Chemical Industrial), BaCO3 (99.99 %; Rare Metallic), TiO2 (99.98 %; PMT-881, Ishihara Sangyo), and MnO2 (99.99 %; Kojundo Chemical Laboratory) were weighed according to the chemical formula, and they were ball-milled with zirconia balls with a diameter of 1 mm and ethanol at 250 rpm for 16 h. After drying at 80 \u02daC, the mixture was added with a 5 wt% polyvinyl butyral binder and passed through a 250 \xb5m mesh. The mixed powder of about 0.5 g and a SrTiO3 seed crystal (Furuuchi Chemical) was pressed into a disc compact in a die with a diameter of 10 mm at 200 MPa. Here, the SrTiO3 seed crystal was located at the center of the compact. The size of the seed crystal was about 3 mm\xd73 mm\xd70.5 mm, and the 3 mm\xd73 mm faces were mirror-polished and parallel to the (110) face and parallel to the faces of the compact. Several compacts were heated at 700 \u02daC for 2 h in the air to remove the binder and then heated at 1200 \u02daC for 24 h in the air for sintering in a box-type electric furnace. The heating and cooling rates were 150 \u02daC/h. An X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (a \u03b8-2\u03b8 scan) was measured on a face of the sintered compact to study the crystal structure using an XRD apparatus (SmartLab, Rigaku) with Cu K\u03b1 radiation. Polished samples were thermally etched at 1050 \u02daC for 30 min, and then they were observed by an optical microscopy (MS-3667T, BioTools) and a field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JSM IT700-HR, JEOL) equipped with energy dispersed X-ray spectroscopy (EDS; Dry SD30, JEOL). To determine a grain size, the two lengths of a grain were measured on an SEM image and the average length was calculated. The average length was measured for 60 \u2013 100 grains, and the average of the average lengths and the standard deviation were determined to be the grain size and the error bar. The crystal structure was measured by XRD (\u03b8-2\u03b8 and pole figure scans) for single crystals. For the pole figure scan, a tilt angle \u03b1 and a rotation angle \u03b2 were changed from 30 to 90\u02da and 0 to 360\u02da with steps of \u0394\u03b1 = 5\u02da and \u0394\u03b2 = 5\u02da, respectively. Here, the tilt angle \u03b1 = 90\u02da was defined as not tilting. Ag paste was applied to the {110}c faces of the single crystals, and heated to 550 \u02daC to form Ag electrodes. The sample sizes are 1.8 mm\xd71.6 mm\xd70.4 mm (1.8 mm\xd71.6 mm face electroded), 1.6 mm\xd70.9 mm\xd70.4 mm (1.6 mm\xd70.9 mm face electroded), and 1.7 mm\xd71.4 mm\xd70.4 mm (1.7 mm\xd71.4 mm face electroded) at x = 0, 0.05, and 0.1, respectively. The temperature dependence of dielectric properties was measured at frequencies of 1, 10, and 100 kHz by an LCR meter (IM3536, HIOKI) at a temperature range of 20 \u2013 350 \u02daC with a heating rate of 3 \u02daC/min. A polarization \u2013 electric field (P-E) loop and a strain \u2013 electric field (S-E) curve was measured at 0.1 Hz and 25 \u02daC by a polarization and strain measuring system (Model JP005-SE, Lead Techno) with a displacement meter (Millimar S 1840, Mahr). For poling, a single crystal sample was initially heated to 150 \u02daC, and then a dc electric field of 30 kV/cm was applied for 15 min, followed by cooling to 50 \u02daC with applying the electric field before the electric field was removed at 50 \u02daC. A unipolar S-E curve was measured at 0.1 Hz and 25 \u02daC by the polarization and strain measuring system to calculate a converse piezoelectric effect d33* (pm/V). A direct piezoelectric effect (d33) was measured at 25 \u02daC by a d33 meter (Model ZJ-6B, Chinese Academy of Science).

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
shows the photograph of 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 sintered compacts. A single crystal grown to the center of the face of each sintered compact could be seen at x = 0 \u2013 0.1. The size of the single crystal visible on the face was about 1.3 mm\xd72.4 mm, 1.8 mm\xd72.2 mm, and 2.3 mm\xd73.0 mm at x = 0, 0.05, and 0.1, respectively. The color of the compact was beige at x = 0 and it became darker with increasing x. This was due to the black color of the MnO2 powder. (a) shows the XRD patterns of the faces of the 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 sintered compacts shown in. At x = 0 \u2013 0.1, the strong diffraction peaks from (101), (110), (202), and (220) planes were observed, indicating that the 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 single crystals grew with the orientation of the (110) SrTiO3 seed crystal. In contrast, the XRD patterns at x = 0.3 and 0.5 were those of randomly oriented polycrystalline ceramics. A clear peak shift with increasing x was not observed, probably because the addition of MnO2 was small. (b) shows the XRD patterns of the 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 single crystal faces which were originally attached to the seed crystals. Only the {110}c diffraction peaks were observed for the samples, which was similar to the diffraction patterns in (a). (c) shows the pole figure of {100}c orientation for the 0.85BNT-0.15BT + 0.1 wt%MnO2 single crystal. Two diffraction spots were observed at \u03b1 \u223c 45\u02da, and they were symmetrical with respect to the center. This confirms that {100}c planes appeared when the {110}c planes were tilted by about 45\u02da, and the x = 0.1 sample was a single crystal. (b) and (c) suggest that the x = 0 and 0.05 samples were also single crystals. shows the optical microscopy images of the cross-sections of the 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 sintered compacts. As mentioned earlier, the single crystals were preferentially grown to one of the faces of the sintered compacts at x = 0 \u2013 0.1. The lengths of the crystals grown from the seed crystal to the surface were 430, 420, and 420 \xb5m at x = 0, 0.05, and 0.1, respectively. The areas near the top left corners of the seed crystals shown in were observed by SEM, as shown in. At x =0.3 and 0.5, the crystal growth lengths were measured to be 160 and 50 \xb5m, respectively. The dense single crystals could be seen at x = 0 \u2013 0.1. To understand the effect of the MnO2 content on the crystal growth length, the polycrystalline parts of the sintered compacts were observed by SEM, as shown in. The grain sizes were measured to be 4.7 \xb1 1.7 \xb5m, 4.6 \xb1 1.6 \xb5m, and 4.9 \xb1 1.8 \xb5m at x = 0, 0.05, and 0.1, respectively, and thus the grain sizes were similar. At x = 0.3 and 0.5, the grain sizes were increased to 7.2 \xb1 2.5 \xb5m and 12 \xb1 4 \xb5m, respectively. The increase in the grain size with increasing MnO2 content was previously reported for 0.94BNT-0.06BT ceramics. It is considered that the increase in the grain size at x = 0.3 and 0.5 inhibited the single crystal growth, because the driving force of the grain growth of a grain in ceramics is inversely proportional to the grain size of the surrounding grains. This result made us assume that the grains in front of the smaller single crystal grown from the (110) face of the seed crystal in the compact were larger than those near the larger single crystal which reached to the surface of the compact at x = 0 \u2013 0.1. Thus, the reason for the preferential crystal growth is not understood at present. summarizes the crystal growth length and the grain size of the 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 sintered compacts as a function of x. At x = 0 \u2013 0.1, the grown crystals reached the surfaces of the sintered compacts and the crystal growth was attributed to small grains of about 5 \xb5m. At x = 0.3 and 0.5, the grain size increased, and this decreased the crystal growth length. shows the SEM image and EDS elemental mapping of the cross-sections of the 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 sintered compacts near a seed crystal \u2013 grown single crystal interface and a grown single crystal \u2013 polycrystalline part interface at x = 0 \u2013 0.1. For the seed crystals and the grown single crystals, the Bi and Na ions of the grown single crystals did not diffuse into the seed crystals (shown for x = 0 only), and the Sr ions of the seed crystals did not diffuse into the grown single crystals. For the grown single crystals and the polycrystalline parts, the intensity of the concentration of each element was uniform, except for pores in the polycrystalline parts, which suggested that the compositions of the grown single crystals and the polycrystalline parts were the same, except for needle-like grains especially found in the grown single crystal at x = 0 and 0.1. Such needle-like grains were also reported for BNT-SrTiO3 and BNT-(Sr,Ca)TiO3 single crystals fabricated by an SSCG method , and they were reportedly formed during a thermal etching process for SEM observation. In this study, no secondary phase was found in the XRD patterns of the single crystals ((b)) which were used for the following electric measurements and were not thermally etched. Therefore, the needle-like grains in the study could also be formed during the thermal etching process. shows the temperature dependence of the dielectric properties of the 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 single crystals at x = 0 \u2013 0.1. At 25 \u02daC, the dielectric constants measured at 1 kHz were 490, 460, and 410, and tan\u03b4 was 0.02, 0.02, and 0.01 at x =0, 0.05, and 0.1, respectively. The dielectric constants rapidly increased at 219, 220, and 218 \u02daC at x = 0, 0.05, and 0.1, respectively. Tmax was 256, 261, and 254 \u02daC at x = 0, 0.05, and 0.1, respectively. The Td and Tmax were consistent with those of 0.85BNT-0.15BT ceramics , they were not strongly dependent of x. (a) and (b) show the P-E loop and the S-E curve of the 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 single crystal at x = 0.1. The remanent polarization and the coercive field were 36 \xb5C/cmE^{2} and 29 kV/cm, respectively. (c) shows the unipolar S-E curve of the poled 0.85BNT-0.15BT + 0.1 wt%MnO2 single crystal. The converse piezoelectric effect d33* calculated from the slope was 108 pm/V. The direct piezoelectric effect d33 measured by the d33 meter was 118 pC/N. Note that typical ferroelectric responses could not be measured at x = 0 and 0.05 due to a breakdown during the measurements of P-E loops and S-E curves. In 0.85BNT-0.15BT, Bi may volatile during the sintering due to a high vapor pressure and this is accompanied by the removal of oxygen, which is expressed as  Here, the Kr\xf6ger-Vink notation was used. The holes may decrease the resistivity of the ceramics at x = 0, and cause the breakdown. For the MnO2 added samples, Mn may trap holes due to its several stable oxidation states. It is considered that the content of MnO2 was not enough to trap the holes at x = 0.05. The piezoelectric property at x = 0.1 was compared with that of other BNT-BT ceramics and single crystals, as shown in. The d33 value measured in this study was larger than that of the <110>c-oriented and randomly oriented 0.85BNT-0.15BT ceramics but smaller than that of the <001>c-oriented ceramics. An example of the rotator is BaTiO3 at room temperature and that of the extender is PbTiO3. 0.85BNT-0.15BT has a phase transition of about 220 \u02daC which is far from room temperature and the composition is far from a phase boundary composition of 0.94BNT-0.06BT. Besides, larger d33 was measured in the polar <001>c direction. Thus, 0.85BNT-0.15BT is considered to be an extender. One of the characteristics of the extender is a weak anisotropy; that is, the difference in the d33 values in <001>c and <110>c directions was small. In contrast, at rhombohedral 0.95BNT-0.05BT and phase boundary 0.94BNT-0.06BT, the d33 values of the <100>c-oriented single crystals were about 3 times larger than those of a <111>c-oriented single crystal and randomly oriented ceramics. Therefore, a decrease in domain size in 0.85BNT-0.15BT could increase d33, and only the single crystals oriented along to non-polar directions such as <110>c and <111>c could decrease domain size. Such poling treatments would increase the piezoelectric properties of <110>c-oriented MnO2 added 0.85BNT-0.15BT single crystals.

In 0.85BNT-0.15BT, Bi may volatile during the sintering due to a high vapor pressure and this is accompanied by the removal of oxygen, which is expressed as  Here, the Kr\xf6ger-Vink notation was used. The holes may decrease the resistivity of the ceramics at x = 0, and cause the breakdown. For the MnO2 added samples, Mn may trap holes due to its several stable oxidation states. It is considered that the content of MnO2 was not enough to trap the holes at x = 0.05. The piezoelectric property at x = 0.1 was compared with that of other BNT-BT ceramics and single crystals, as shown in. The d33 value measured in this study was larger than that of the <110>c-oriented and randomly oriented 0.85BNT-0.15BT ceramics but smaller than that of the <001>c-oriented ceramics. An example of the rotator is BaTiO3 at room temperature and that of the extender is PbTiO3. 0.85BNT-0.15BT has a phase transition of about 220 \u02daC which is far from room temperature and the composition is far from a phase boundary composition of 0.94BNT-0.06BT. Besides, larger d33 was measured in the polar <001>c direction. Thus, 0.85BNT-0.15BT is considered to be an extender. One of the characteristics of the extender is a weak anisotropy; that is, the difference in the d33 values in <001>c and <110>c directions was small. In contrast, at rhombohedral 0.95BNT-0.05BT and phase boundary 0.94BNT-0.06BT, the d33 values of the <100>c-oriented single crystals were about 3 times larger than those of a <111>c-oriented single crystal and randomly oriented ceramics. Therefore, a decrease in domain size in 0.85BNT-0.15BT could increase d33, and only the single crystals oriented along to non-polar directions such as <110>c and <111>c could decrease domain size. Such poling treatments would increase the piezoelectric properties of <110>c-oriented MnO2 added 0.85BNT-0.15BT single crystals.

<110>c-oriented 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 (x=0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5) single crystals were fabricated by an SSCG method. The raw powders of (Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3 (0.6 \xb5m, Nippon Chemical Industrial), BaCO3 (99.99 %; Rare Metallic), TiO2 (99.98 %; PMT-881, Ishihara Sangyo), and MnO2 (99.99 %; Kojundo Chemical Laboratory) were weighed according to the chemical formula, and they were ball-milled with zirconia balls with a diameter of 1 mm and ethanol at 250 rpm for 16 h. After drying at 80 \u02daC, the mixture was added with a 5 wt% polyvinyl butyral binder and passed through a 250 \xb5m mesh. The mixed powder of about 0.5 g and a SrTiO3 seed crystal (Furuuchi Chemical) was pressed into a disc compact in a die with a diameter of 10 mm at 200 MPa. Here, the SrTiO3 seed crystal was located at the center of the compact. The size of the seed crystal was about 3 mm\xd73 mm\xd70.5 mm, and the 3 mm\xd73 mm faces were mirror-polished and parallel to the (110) face and parallel to the faces of the compact. Several compacts were heated at 700 \u02daC for 2 h in the air to remove the binder and then heated at 1200 \u02daC for 24 h in the air for sintering in a box-type electric furnace. The heating and cooling rates were 150 \u02daC/h. An X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (a \u03b8-2\u03b8 scan) was measured on a face of the sintered compact to study the crystal structure using an XRD apparatus (SmartLab, Rigaku) with Cu K\u03b1 radiation. Polished samples were thermally etched at 1050 \u02daC for 30 min, and then they were observed by an optical microscopy (MS-3667T, BioTools) and a field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JSM IT700-HR, JEOL) equipped with energy dispersed X-ray spectroscopy (EDS; Dry SD30, JEOL). To determine a grain size, the two lengths of a grain were measured on an SEM image and the average length was calculated. The average length was measured for 60 \u2013 100 grains, and the average of the average lengths and the standard deviation were determined to be the grain size and the error bar. The crystal structure was measured by XRD (\u03b8-2\u03b8 and pole figure scans) for single crystals. For the pole figure scan, a tilt angle \u03b1 and a rotation angle \u03b2 were changed from 30 to 90\u02da and 0 to 360\u02da with steps of \u0394\u03b1 = 5\u02da and \u0394\u03b2 = 5\u02da, respectively. Here, the tilt angle \u03b1 = 90\u02da was defined as not tilting. Ag paste was applied to the {110}c faces of the single crystals, and heated to 550 \u02daC to form Ag electrodes. The sample sizes are 1.8 mm\xd71.6 mm\xd70.4 mm (1.8 mm\xd71.6 mm face electroded), 1.6 mm\xd70.9 mm\xd70.4 mm (1.6 mm\xd70.9 mm face electroded), and 1.7 mm\xd71.4 mm\xd70.4 mm (1.7 mm\xd71.4 mm face electroded) at x = 0, 0.05, and 0.1, respectively. The temperature dependence of dielectric properties was measured at frequencies of 1, 10, and 100 kHz by an LCR meter (IM3536, HIOKI) at a temperature range of 20 \u2013 350 \u02daC with a heating rate of 3 \u02daC/min. A polarization \u2013 electric field (P-E) loop and a strain \u2013 electric field (S-E) curve was measured at 0.1 Hz and 25 \u02daC by a polarization and strain measuring system (Model JP005-SE, Lead Techno) with a displacement meter (Millimar S 1840, Mahr). For poling, a single crystal sample was initially heated to 150 \u02daC, and then a dc electric field of 30 kV/cm was applied for 15 min, followed by cooling to 50 \u02daC with applying the electric field before the electric field was removed at 50 \u02daC. A unipolar S-E curve was measured at 0.1 Hz and 25 \u02daC by the polarization and strain measuring system to calculate a converse piezoelectric effect d33* (pm/V). A direct piezoelectric effect (d33) was measured at 25 \u02daC by a d33 meter (Model ZJ-6B, Chinese Academy of Science).

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
shows the photograph of 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 sintered compacts. A single crystal grown to the center of the face of each sintered compact could be seen at x = 0 \u2013 0.1. The size of the single crystal visible on the face was about 1.3 mm\xd72.4 mm, 1.8 mm\xd72.2 mm, and 2.3 mm\xd73.0 mm at x = 0, 0.05, and 0.1, respectively. The color of the compact was beige at x = 0 and it became darker with increasing x. This was due to the black color of the MnO2 powder. (a) shows the XRD patterns of the faces of the 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 sintered compacts shown in. At x = 0 \u2013 0.1, the strong diffraction peaks from (101), (110), (202), and (220) planes were observed, indicating that the 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 single crystals grew with the orientation of the (110) SrTiO3 seed crystal. In contrast, the XRD patterns at x = 0.3 and 0.5 were those of randomly oriented polycrystalline ceramics. A clear peak shift with increasing x was not observed, probably because the addition of MnO2 was small. (b) shows the XRD patterns of the 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 single crystal faces which were originally attached to the seed crystals. Only the {110}c diffraction peaks were observed for the samples, which was similar to the diffraction patterns in (a). (c) shows the pole figure of {100}c orientation for the 0.85BNT-0.15BT + 0.1 wt%MnO2 single crystal. Two diffraction spots were observed at \u03b1 \u223c 45\u02da, and they were symmetrical with respect to the center. This confirms that {100}c planes appeared when the {110}c planes were tilted by about 45\u02da, and the x = 0.1 sample was a single crystal. (b) and (c) suggest that the x = 0 and 0.05 samples were also single crystals. shows the optical microscopy images of the cross-sections of the 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 sintered compacts. As mentioned earlier, the single crystals were preferentially grown to one of the faces of the sintered compacts at x = 0 \u2013 0.1. The lengths of the crystals grown from the seed crystal to the surface were 430, 420, and 420 \xb5m at x = 0, 0.05, and 0.1, respectively. The areas near the top left corners of the seed crystals shown in were observed by SEM, as shown in. At x =0.3 and 0.5, the crystal growth lengths were measured to be 160 and 50 \xb5m, respectively. The dense single crystals could be seen at x = 0 \u2013 0.1. To understand the effect of the MnO2 content on the crystal growth length, the polycrystalline parts of the sintered compacts were observed by SEM, as shown in. The grain sizes were measured to be 4.7 \xb1 1.7 \xb5m, 4.6 \xb1 1.6 \xb5m, and 4.9 \xb1 1.8 \xb5m at x = 0, 0.05, and 0.1, respectively, and thus the grain sizes were similar. At x = 0.3 and 0.5, the grain sizes were increased to 7.2 \xb1 2.5 \xb5m and 12 \xb1 4 \xb5m, respectively. The increase in the grain size with increasing MnO2 content was previously reported for 0.94BNT-0.06BT ceramics. It is considered that the increase in the grain size at x = 0.3 and 0.5 inhibited the single crystal growth, because the driving force of the grain growth of a grain in ceramics is inversely proportional to the grain size of the surrounding grains. This result made us assume that the grains in front of the smaller single crystal grown from the (110) face of the seed crystal in the compact were larger than those near the larger single crystal which reached to the surface of the compact at x = 0 \u2013 0.1. Thus, the reason for the preferential crystal growth is not understood at present. summarizes the crystal growth length and the grain size of the 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 sintered compacts as a function of x. At x = 0 \u2013 0.1, the grown crystals reached the surfaces of the sintered compacts and the crystal growth was attributed to small grains of about 5 \xb5m. At x = 0.3 and 0.5, the grain size increased, and this decreased the crystal growth length. shows the SEM image and EDS elemental mapping of the cross-sections of the 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 sintered compacts near a seed crystal \u2013 grown single crystal interface and a grown single crystal \u2013 polycrystalline part interface at x = 0 \u2013 0.1. For the seed crystals and the grown single crystals, the Bi and Na ions of the grown single crystals did not diffuse into the seed crystals (shown for x = 0 only), and the Sr ions of the seed crystals did not diffuse into the grown single crystals. For the grown single crystals and the polycrystalline parts, the intensity of the concentration of each element was uniform, except for pores in the polycrystalline parts, which suggested that the compositions of the grown single crystals and the polycrystalline parts were the same, except for needle-like grains especially found in the grown single crystal at x = 0 and 0.1. Such needle-like grains were also reported for BNT-SrTiO3 and BNT-(Sr,Ca)TiO3 single crystals fabricated by an SSCG method , and they were reportedly formed during a thermal etching process for SEM observation. In this study, no secondary phase was found in the XRD patterns of the single crystals ((b)) which were used for the following electric measurements and were not thermally etched. Therefore, the needle-like grains in the study could also be formed during the thermal etching process. shows the temperature dependence of the dielectric properties of the 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 single crystals at x = 0 \u2013 0.1. At 25 \u02daC, the dielectric constants measured at 1 kHz were 490, 460, and 410, and tan\u03b4 was 0.02, 0.02, and 0.01 at x =0, 0.05, and 0.1, respectively. The dielectric constants rapidly increased at 219, 220, and 218 \u02daC at x = 0, 0.05, and 0.1, respectively. Tmax was 256, 261, and 254 \u02daC at x = 0, 0.05, and 0.1, respectively. The Td and Tmax were consistent with those of 0.85BNT-0.15BT ceramics , they were not strongly dependent of x. (a) and (b) show the P-E loop and the S-E curve of the 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 single crystal at x = 0.1. The remanent polarization and the coercive field were 36 \xb5C/cmE^{2} and 29 kV/cm, respectively. (c) shows the unipolar S-E curve of the poled 0.85BNT-0.15BT + 0.1 wt%MnO2 single crystal. The converse piezoelectric effect d33* calculated from the slope was 108 pm/V. The direct piezoelectric effect d33 measured by the d33 meter was 118 pC/N. Note that typical ferroelectric responses could not be measured at x = 0 and 0.05 due to a breakdown during the measurements of P-E loops and S-E curves. In 0.85BNT-0.15BT, Bi may volatile during the sintering due to a high vapor pressure and this is accompanied by the removal of oxygen, which is expressed as  Here, the Kr\xf6ger-Vink notation was used. The holes may decrease the resistivity of the ceramics at x = 0, and cause the breakdown. For the MnO2 added samples, Mn may trap holes due to its several stable oxidation states. It is considered that the content of MnO2 was not enough to trap the holes at x = 0.05. The piezoelectric property at x = 0.1 was compared with that of other BNT-BT ceramics and single crystals, as shown in. The d33 value measured in this study was larger than that of the <110>c-oriented and randomly oriented 0.85BNT-0.15BT ceramics but smaller than that of the <001>c-oriented ceramics. An example of the rotator is BaTiO3 at room temperature and that of the extender is PbTiO3. 0.85BNT-0.15BT has a phase transition of about 220 \u02daC which is far from room temperature and the composition is far from a phase boundary composition of 0.94BNT-0.06BT. Besides, larger d33 was measured in the polar <001>c direction. Thus, 0.85BNT-0.15BT is considered to be an extender. One of the characteristics of the extender is a weak anisotropy; that is, the difference in the d33 values in <001>c and <110>c directions was small. In contrast, at rhombohedral 0.95BNT-0.05BT and phase boundary 0.94BNT-0.06BT, the d33 values of the <100>c-oriented single crystals were about 3 times larger than those of a <111>c-oriented single crystal and randomly oriented ceramics. Therefore, a decrease in domain size in 0.85BNT-0.15BT could increase d33, and only the single crystals oriented along to non-polar directions such as <110>c and <111>c could decrease domain size. Such poling treatments would increase the piezoelectric properties of <110>c-oriented MnO2 added 0.85BNT-0.15BT single crystals.

<110>c-oriented 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 (x=0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5) single crystals were fabricated by an SSCG method. The raw powders of (Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3 (0.6 \xb5m, Nippon Chemical Industrial), BaCO3 (99.99 %; Rare Metallic), TiO2 (99.98 %; PMT-881, Ishihara Sangyo), and MnO2 (99.99 %; Kojundo Chemical Laboratory) were weighed according to the chemical formula, and they were ball-milled with zirconia balls with a diameter of 1 mm and ethanol at 250 rpm for 16 h. After drying at 80 \u02daC, the mixture was added with a 5 wt% polyvinyl butyral binder and passed through a 250 \xb5m mesh. The mixed powder of about 0.5 g and a SrTiO3 seed crystal (Furuuchi Chemical) was pressed into a disc compact in a die with a diameter of 10 mm at 200 MPa. Here, the SrTiO3 seed crystal was located at the center of the compact. The size of the seed crystal was about 3 mm\xd73 mm\xd70.5 mm, and the 3 mm\xd73 mm faces were mirror-polished and parallel to the (110) face and parallel to the faces of the compact. Several compacts were heated at 700 \u02daC for 2 h in the air to remove the binder and then heated at 1200 \u02daC for 24 h in the air for sintering in a box-type electric furnace. The heating and cooling rates were 150 \u02daC/h. An X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (a \u03b8-2\u03b8 scan) was measured on a face of the sintered compact to study the crystal structure using an XRD apparatus (SmartLab, Rigaku) with Cu K\u03b1 radiation.

To determine a grain size, the two lengths of a grain were measured on an SEM image and the average length was calculated. The average length was measured for 60 \u2013 100 grains, and the average of the average lengths and the standard deviation were determined to be the grain size and the error bar. The crystal structure was measured by XRD (\u03b8-2\u03b8 and pole figure scans) for single crystals. For the pole figure scan, a tilt angle \u03b1 and a rotation angle \u03b2 were changed from 30 to 90\u02da and 0 to 360\u02da with steps of \u0394\u03b1 = 5\u02da and \u0394\u03b2 = 5\u02da, respectively. Here, the tilt angle \u03b1 = 90\u02da was defined as not tilting. Ag paste was applied to the {110}c faces of the single crystals, and heated to 550 \u02daC to form Ag electrodes. The sample sizes are 1.8 mm\xd71.6 mm\xd70.4 mm (1.8 mm\xd71.6 mm face electroded), 1.6 mm\xd70.9 mm\xd70.4 mm (1.6 mm\xd70.9 mm face electroded), and 1.7 mm\xd71.4 mm\xd70.4 mm (1.7 mm\xd71.4 mm face electroded) at x = 0, 0.05, and 0.1, respectively. The temperature dependence of dielectric properties was measured at frequencies of 1, 10, and 100 kHz by an LCR meter (IM3536, HIOKI) at a temperature range of 20 \u2013 350 \u02daC with a heating rate of 3 \u02daC/min. A polarization \u2013 electric field (P-E) loop and a strain \u2013 electric field (S-E) curve was measured at 0.1 Hz and 25 \u02daC by a polarization and strain measuring system (Model JP005-SE, Lead Techno) with a displacement meter (Millimar S 1840, Mahr). For poling, a single crystal sample was initially heated to 150 \u02daC, and then a dc electric field of 30 kV/cm was applied for 15 min, followed by cooling to 50 \u02daC with applying the electric field before the electric field was removed at 50 \u02daC. A unipolar S-E curve was measured at 0.1 Hz and 25 \u02daC by the polarization and strain measuring system to calculate a converse piezoelectric effect d33* (pm/V).

At x = 0 \u2013 0.1, the grown crystals reached the surfaces of the sintered compacts and the crystal growth was attributed to small grains of about 5 \xb5m. At x = 0.3 and 0.5, the grain size increased, and this decreased the crystal growth length. shows the SEM image and EDS elemental mapping of the cross-sections of the 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 sintered compacts near a seed crystal \u2013 grown single crystal interface and a grown single crystal \u2013 polycrystalline part interface at x = 0 \u2013 0.1. For the seed crystals and the grown single crystals, the Bi and Na ions of the grown single crystals did not diffuse into the seed crystals (shown for x = 0 only), and the Sr ions of the seed crystals did not diffuse into the grown single crystals. For the grown single crystals and the polycrystalline parts, the intensity of the concentration of each element was uniform, except for pores in the polycrystalline parts, which suggested that the compositions of the grown single crystals and the polycrystalline parts were the same, except for needle-like grains especially found in the grown single crystal at x = 0 and 0.1. Such needle-like grains were also reported for BNT-SrTiO3 and BNT-(Sr,Ca)TiO3 single crystals fabricated by an SSCG method , and they were reportedly formed during a thermal etching process for SEM observation. In this study, no secondary phase was found in the XRD patterns of the single crystals ((b)) which were used for the following electric measurements and were not thermally etched. Therefore, the needle-like grains in the study could also be formed during the thermal etching process. shows the temperature dependence of the dielectric properties of the 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 single crystals at x = 0 \u2013 0.1. At 25 \u02daC, the dielectric constants measured at 1 kHz were 490, 460, and 410, and tan\u03b4 was 0.02, 0.02, and 0.01 at x =0, 0.05, and 0.1, respectively. The dielectric constants rapidly increased at 219, 220, and 218 \u02daC at x = 0, 0.05, and 0.1, respectively. Tmax was 256, 261, and 254 \u02daC at x = 0, 0.05, and 0.1, respectively. The Td and Tmax were consistent with those of 0.85BNT-0.15BT ceramics , they were not strongly dependent of x. (a) and (b) show the P-E loop and the S-E curve of the 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 single crystal at x = 0.1. The remanent polarization and the coercive field were 36 \xb5C/cmE^{2} and 29 kV/cm, respectively. (c) shows the unipolar S-E curve of the poled 0.85BNT-0.15BT + 0.1 wt%MnO2 single crystal. The converse piezoelectric effect d33* calculated from the slope was 108 pm/V. The direct piezoelectric effect d33 measured by the d33 meter was 118 pC/N. Note that typical ferroelectric responses could not be measured at x = 0 and 0.05 due to a breakdown during the measurements of P-E loops and S-E curves. In 0.85BNT-0.15BT, Bi may volatile during the sintering due to a high vapor pressure and this is accompanied by the removal of oxygen, which is expressed as  Here, the Kr\xf6ger-Vink notation was used. The holes may decrease the resistivity of the ceramics at x = 0, and cause the breakdown. For the MnO2 added samples, Mn may trap holes due to its several stable oxidation states. It is considered that the content of MnO2 was not enough to trap the holes at x = 0.05. The piezoelectric property at x = 0.1 was compared with that of other BNT-BT ceramics and single crystals, as shown in. The d33 value measured in this study was larger than that of the <110>c-oriented and randomly oriented 0.85BNT-0.15BT ceramics but smaller than that of the <001>c-oriented ceramics. An example of the rotator is BaTiO3 at room temperature and that of the extender is PbTiO3. 0.85BNT-0.15BT has a phase transition of about 220 \u02daC which is far from room temperature and the composition is far from a phase boundary composition of 0.94BNT-0.06BT. Besides, larger d33 was measured in the polar <001>c direction. Thus, 0.85BNT-0.15BT is considered to be an extender. One of the characteristics of the extender is a weak anisotropy; that is, the difference in the d33 values in <001>c and <110>c directions was small. In contrast, at rhombohedral 0.95BNT-0.05BT and phase boundary 0.94BNT-0.06BT, the d33 values of the <100>c-oriented single crystals were about 3 times larger than those of a <111>c-oriented single crystal and randomly oriented ceramics. Therefore, a decrease in domain size in 0.85BNT-0.15BT could increase d33, and only the single crystals oriented along to non-polar directions such as <110>c and <111>c could decrease domain size. Such poling treatments would increase the piezoelectric properties of <110>c-oriented MnO2 added 0.85BNT-0.15BT single crystals.

<110>c-oriented 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 (x=0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5) single crystals were fabricated by an SSCG method. The raw powders of (Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3 (0.6 \xb5m, Nippon Chemical Industrial), BaCO3 (99.99 %; Rare Metallic), TiO2 (99.98 %; PMT-881, Ishihara Sangyo), and MnO2 (99.99 %; Kojundo Chemical Laboratory) were weighed according to the chemical formula, and they were ball-milled with zirconia balls with a diameter of 1 mm and ethanol at 250 rpm for 16 h. After drying at 80 \u02daC, the mixture was added with a 5 wt% polyvinyl butyral binder and passed through a 250 \xb5m mesh. The mixed powder of about 0.5 g and a SrTiO3 seed crystal (Furuuchi Chemical) was pressed into a disc compact in a die with a diameter of 10 mm at 200 MPa. Here, the SrTiO3 seed crystal was located at the center of the compact. The size of the seed crystal was about 3 mm\xd73 mm\xd70.5 mm, and the 3 mm\xd73 mm faces were mirror-polished and parallel to the (110) face and parallel to the faces of the compact. Several compacts were heated at 700 \u02daC for 2 h in the air to remove the binder and then heated at 1200 \u02daC for 24 h in the air for sintering in a box-type electric furnace. The heating and cooling rates were 150 \u02daC/h. An X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (a \u03b8-2\u03b8 scan) was measured on a face of the sintered compact to study the crystal structure using an XRD apparatus (SmartLab, Rigaku) with Cu K\u03b1 radiation. Polished samples were thermally etched at 1050 \u02daC for 30 min, and then they were observed by an optical microscopy (MS-3667T, BioTools) and a field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JSM IT700-HR, JEOL) equipped with energy dispersed X-ray spectroscopy (EDS; Dry SD30, JEOL). To determine a grain size, the two lengths of a grain were measured on an SEM image and the average length was calculated. The average length was measured for 60 \u2013 100 grains, and the average of the average lengths and the standard deviation were determined to be the grain size and the error bar. The crystal structure was measured by XRD (\u03b8-2\u03b8 and pole figure scans) for single crystals. For the pole figure scan, a tilt angle \u03b1 and a rotation angle \u03b2 were changed from 30 to 90\u02da and 0 to 360\u02da with steps of \u0394\u03b1 = 5\u02da and \u0394\u03b2 = 5\u02da, respectively. Here, the tilt angle \u03b1 = 90\u02da was defined as not tilting. Ag paste was applied to the {110}c faces of the single crystals, and heated to 550 \u02daC to form Ag electrodes. The sample sizes are 1.8 mm\xd71.6 mm\xd70.4 mm (1.8 mm\xd71.6 mm face electroded), 1.6 mm\xd70.9 mm\xd70.4 mm (1.6 mm\xd70.9 mm face electroded), and 1.7 mm\xd71.4 mm\xd70.4 mm (1.7 mm\xd71.4 mm face electroded) at x = 0, 0.05, and 0.1, respectively. The temperature dependence of dielectric properties was measured at frequencies of 1, 10, and 100 kHz by an LCR meter (IM3536, HIOKI) at a temperature range of 20 \u2013 350 \u02daC with a heating rate of 3 \u02daC/min. A polarization \u2013 electric field (P-E) loop and a strain \u2013 electric field (S-E) curve was measured at 0.1 Hz and 25 \u02daC by a polarization and strain measuring system (Model JP005-SE, Lead Techno) with a displacement meter (Millimar S 1840, Mahr). For poling, a single crystal sample was initially heated to 150 \u02daC, and then a dc electric field of 30 kV/cm was applied for 15 min, followed by cooling to 50 \u02daC with applying the electric field before the electric field was removed at 50 \u02daC. A unipolar S-E curve was measured at 0.1 Hz and 25 \u02daC by the polarization and strain measuring system to calculate a converse piezoelectric effect d33* (pm/V). A direct piezoelectric effect (d33) was measured at 25 \u02daC by a d33 meter (Model ZJ-6B, Chinese Academy of Science).

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
shows the photograph of 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 sintered compacts. A single crystal grown to the center of the face of each sintered compact could be seen at x = 0 \u2013 0.1. The size of the single crystal visible on the face was about 1.3 mm\xd72.4 mm, 1.8 mm\xd72.2 mm, and 2.3 mm\xd73.0 mm at x = 0, 0.05, and 0.1, respectively. The color of the compact was beige at x = 0 and it became darker with increasing x. This was due to the black color of the MnO2 powder. (a) shows the XRD patterns of the faces of the 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 sintered compacts shown in. At x = 0 \u2013 0.1, the strong diffraction peaks from (101), (110), (202), and (220) planes were observed, indicating that the 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 single crystals grew with the orientation of the (110) SrTiO3 seed crystal. In contrast, the XRD patterns at x = 0.3 and 0.5 were those of randomly oriented polycrystalline ceramics. A clear peak shift with increasing x was not observed, probably because the addition of MnO2 was small. (b) shows the XRD patterns of the 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 single crystal faces which were originally attached to the seed crystals. Only the {110}c diffraction peaks were observed for the samples, which was similar to the diffraction patterns in (a). (c) shows the pole figure of {100}c orientation for the 0.85BNT-0.15BT + 0.1 wt%MnO2 single crystal. Two diffraction spots were observed at \u03b1 \u223c 45\u02da, and they were symmetrical with respect to the center. This confirms that {100}c planes appeared when the {110}c planes were tilted by about 45\u02da, and the x = 0.1 sample was a single crystal. (b) and (c) suggest that the x = 0 and 0.05 samples were also single crystals. shows the optical microscopy images of the cross-sections of the 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 sintered compacts. As mentioned earlier, the single crystals were preferentially grown to one of the faces of the sintered compacts at x = 0 \u2013 0.1. The lengths of the crystals grown from the seed crystal to the surface were 430, 420, and 420 \xb5m at x = 0, 0.05, and 0.1, respectively. The areas near the top left corners of the seed crystals shown in were observed by SEM, as shown in. At x =0.3 and 0.5, the crystal growth lengths were measured to be 160 and 50 \xb5m, respectively. The dense single crystals could be seen at x = 0 \u2013 0.1. To understand the effect of the MnO2 content on the crystal growth length, the polycrystalline parts of the sintered compacts were observed by SEM, as shown in. The grain sizes were measured to be 4.7 \xb1 1.7 \xb5m, 4.6 \xb1 1.6 \xb5m, and 4.9 \xb1 1.8 \xb5m at x = 0, 0.05, and 0.1, respectively, and thus the grain sizes were similar. At x = 0.3 and 0.5, the grain sizes were increased to 7.2 \xb1 2.5 \xb5m and 12 \xb1 4 \xb5m, respectively. The increase in the grain size with increasing MnO2 content was previously reported for 0.94BNT-0.06BT ceramics. It is considered that the increase in the grain size at x = 0.3 and 0.5 inhibited the single crystal growth, because the driving force of the grain growth of a grain in ceramics is inversely proportional to the grain size of the surrounding grains. This result made us assume that the grains in front of the smaller single crystal grown from the (110) face of the seed crystal in the compact were larger than those near the larger single crystal which reached to the surface of the compact at x = 0 \u2013 0.1. Thus, the reason for the preferential crystal growth is not understood at present. summarizes the crystal growth length and the grain size of the 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 sintered compacts as a function of x. At x = 0 \u2013 0.1, the grown crystals reached the surfaces of the sintered compacts and the crystal growth was attributed to small grains of about 5 \xb5m. At x = 0.3 and 0.5, the grain size increased, and this decreased the crystal growth length. shows the SEM image and EDS elemental mapping of the cross-sections of the 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 sintered compacts near a seed crystal \u2013 grown single crystal interface and a grown single crystal \u2013 polycrystalline part interface at x = 0 \u2013 0.1. For the seed crystals and the grown single crystals, the Bi and Na ions of the grown single crystals did not diffuse into the seed crystals (shown for x = 0 only), and the Sr ions of the seed crystals did not diffuse into the grown single crystals. For the grown single crystals and the polycrystalline parts, the intensity of the concentration of each element was uniform, except for pores in the polycrystalline parts, which suggested that the compositions of the grown single crystals and the polycrystalline parts were the same, except for needle-like grains especially found in the grown single crystal at x = 0 and 0.1. Such needle-like grains were also reported for BNT-SrTiO3 and BNT-(Sr,Ca)TiO3 single crystals fabricated by an SSCG method , and they were reportedly formed during a thermal etching process for SEM observation. In this study, no secondary phase was found in the XRD patterns of the single crystals ((b)) which were used for the following electric measurements and were not thermally etched. Therefore, the needle-like grains in the study could also be formed during the thermal etching process. shows the temperature dependence of the dielectric properties of the 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 single crystals at x = 0 \u2013 0.1. At 25 \u02daC, the dielectric constants measured at 1 kHz were 490, 460, and 410, and tan\u03b4 was 0.02, 0.02, and 0.01 at x =0, 0.05, and 0.1, respectively. The dielectric constants rapidly increased at 219, 220, and 218 \u02daC at x = 0, 0.05, and 0.1, respectively. Tmax was 256, 261, and 254 \u02daC at x = 0, 0.05, and 0.1, respectively. The Td and Tmax were consistent with those of 0.85BNT-0.15BT ceramics , they were not strongly dependent of x. (a) and (b) show the P-E loop and the S-E curve of the 0.85BNT-0.15BT + x wt%MnO2 single crystal at x = 0.1. The remanent polarization and the coercive field were 36 \xb5C/cmE^{2} and 29 kV/cm, respectively. (c) shows the unipolar S-E curve of the poled 0.85BNT-0.15BT + 0.1 wt%MnO2 single crystal. The converse piezoelectric effect d33* calculated from the slope was 108 pm/V. The direct piezoelectric effect d33 measured by the d33 meter was 118 pC/N. Note that typical ferroelectric responses could not be measured at x = 0 and 0.05 due to a breakdown during the measurements of P-E loops and S-E curves. In 0.85BNT-0.15BT, Bi may volatile during the sintering due to a high vapor pressure and this is accompanied by the removal of oxygen, which is expressed as  Here, the Kr\xf6ger-Vink notation was used. The holes may decrease the resistivity of the ceramics at x = 0, and cause the breakdown. For the MnO2 added samples, Mn may trap holes due to its several stable oxidation states. It is considered that the content of MnO2 was not enough to trap the holes at x = 0.05. The piezoelectric property at x = 0.1 was compared with that of other BNT-BT ceramics and single crystals, as shown in. The d33 value measured in this study was larger than that of the <110>c-oriented and randomly oriented 0.85BNT-0.15BT ceramics but smaller than that of the <001>c-oriented ceramics. An example of the rotator is BaTiO3 at room temperature and that of the extender is PbTiO3. 0.85BNT-0.15BT has a phase transition of about 220 \u02daC which is far from room temperature and the composition is far from a phase boundary composition of 0.94BNT-0.06BT. Besides, larger d33 was measured in the polar <001>c direction. Thus, 0.85BNT-0.15BT is considered to be an extender. One of the characteristics of the extender is a weak anisotropy; that is, the difference in the d33 values in <001>c and <110>c directions was small. In contrast, at rhombohedral 0.95BNT-0.05BT and phase boundary 0.94BNT-0.06BT, the d33 values of the <100>c-oriented single crystals were about 3 times larger than those of a <111>c-oriented single crystal and randomly oriented ceramics. Therefore, a decrease in domain size in 0.85BNT-0.15BT could increase d33, and only the single crystals oriented along to non-polar directions such as <110>c and <111>c could decrease domain size. Such poling treatments would increase the piezoelectric properties of <110>c-oriented MnO2 added 0.85BNT-0.15BT single crystals.
