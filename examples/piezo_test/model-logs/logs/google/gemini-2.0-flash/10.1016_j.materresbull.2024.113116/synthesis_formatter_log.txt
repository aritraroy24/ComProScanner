**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'Solvent casting followed by hot pressing', 'precursors': ['PVDF', 'N, N-dimethylformamide', 'BCT3'], 'steps': ['Dissolving PVDF in N, N-dimethylformamide at 60 °C', 'Mixing PVDF in DMF for four hours', 'Adding BCT3 filler to the solution', 'Stirring the solution at 500 rpm for four hours', 'Casting the solution in a petri dish', 'Annealing in an oven at 100 °C for 5 h', 'Peeling off the films from the petri dish', 'Cutting the films into square pieces', 'Hot pressing at 100 °C by applying 125 kg/cmE^{2} pressure'], 'characterization_techniques': ['X-ray diffractometer', 'FESEM-EDX', 'FTIR', 'Dielectric measurements', 'Polarization vs. electric field (PE) hysteresis tracer', 'Digital storage oscilloscope', 'Electrometer', 'UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
