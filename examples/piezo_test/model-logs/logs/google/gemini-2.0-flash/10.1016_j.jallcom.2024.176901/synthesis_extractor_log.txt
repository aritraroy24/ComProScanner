Bi1\u2013xLaxFe1\u2013y ZryO3+\u03b4 (x = {0; 0.10; 0.15}, y = {0; 0.002; 0.01}) powders were synthesized by a hydro-evaporation method starting from water-soluble metal salts. The reagents used in the synthesis are: bismuth(III) nitrate pentahydrate (\u201cMerck\u201d, ACS reagent, \u2265 98 %), iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate (\u201cMerck\u201d, ACS reagent, \u2265 98 %), lanthanum(III) nitrate hexahydrate (\u201cAlfa Aesar\u201d, 99.9 %), zirconium(IV)-acetate hydroxide (\u201cSigma-Aldrich\u201d, 40.4\u201343.3 % gravimetric Zr content) and HNO3 (\u201cSigma-Aldrich\u201d, 65 %). For simplicity reasons, we denoted the doped and co-doped BFO samples as follows ( ): After evaporation at 80 \xbaC, the formed precursor precipitates were additionally heated at the same temperature for 30 min to dry completely. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the precursor powders were performed on a STA 6000 Perkin Elmer simultaneous thermal analyzer from 30 \xbaC to 800 \xbaC in air with a heating rate of 20 \xbaC/min to investigate thermal processes and determine optimal calcination temperature. The precursor powders were calcined at 650 \xbaC for 3 h in air. Then, we pressed as-obtained ceramic powders uniaxially at 880 MPa in a 6 mm die and sintered them at various temperatures to achieve the ceramic samples with optimal compositions and microstructures. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on the sintered samples that were previously ground and pulverized. The XRD patterns were collected using a Rigaku SmartLab diffractometer, with Cu K\u03b1 (\u03bb \u03b11 = 1.54059 \xc5, \u03bb \u03b12 = 1.54441 \xc5) and K\u03b2 (\u03bb \u03b2 = 1.39217 \xc5) radiation. The XRD data were collected in a 2\u03b8 range between 20 and 100\xb0, with a step-size of 0.02\xb0 and a counting rate of 0.5\xb0/min. The Fullprof program (based on the Rietveld method) was used to refine the XRD data and obtain information about the structure (such as lattice parameters, atomic positions, bond lengths, and angles). Fourier Transformed Infra-Red (FT-IR) spectroscopy was performed on the same specimens by using a Perkin Elmer Spectrum Two FT-IR spectrometer in attenuated total reflectance (ATR) mode, from 4000 to 400 cmE^{\u20131}, at a resolution of 4 cmE^{\u22121} and collecting 20 scans per spectrum. The microstructure of the sintered samples was investigated by a TESCAN Vega TS 5130 MM scanning electron microscope using a back-scattered electron detector. The results were present as a mean value \xb1 standard deviation. Standard bipolar and remnant hysteresis, and leakage current measurements of the ceramic samples, sliced to 200 \xb5m in thickness, were performed on a Precision Multiferroic Test System (Radiant Technologies, Inc.) and High Voltage Amplifier up to 4000 V. The piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) of the sintered samples was measured by using a custom-made device calibrated with standard test samples of known d 33 values. The samples were previously electrically poled at different electric fields, during 1 s soaking time, and at room temperature.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The precursor powders represent a mixture of metal nitrates and acetates that undergo several phases during thermal treatment from 30 \xbaC to 800 \xbaC. These processes were shown in for the undoped BFO and the composition with the highest dopant content, BFO-La15-Zr1. Four distinctive endothermic peaks on the DSC curve at 160\u2013170 \xbaC, 240\u2013250 \xbaC, 390\u2013400 \xbaC, and 500\u2013550 \xbaC correspond to main weight losses on the derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) curve below. The two patterns are very similar, although the peaks of the BFO-La15-Zr1 sample slightly shifted towards higher temperatures. Nevertheless, both samples reached a plateau on the DTG curve above 600\u2013620 \xbaC with no weight loss up to 800 \xbaC. Therefore, all the precursor powders were calcined at 650 \xbaC to form bismuth ferrite-based compounds. It is known that BFO is metastable at higher temperatures, and two typical secondary phases, Bi2Fe4O9 (mullite-like, S.G. Pbam) and Bi25FeO39 (sillenite-like, S.G. I23), tend to emerge during the synthesis or the sintering process. Although lanthanum stabilized the perovskite structure and allowed for sintering at a broader temperature range, all lanthanum-doped samples and BFO-Zr1 were sintered at 835 \xbaC for three hours. This temperature was too high for BFO and BFO-Zr0.2, so we sintered them at 780 \xbaC for three hours to obtain appropriate microstructures ( a). If present, the sillenite-like phase (Bi25FeO39) starts to melt at \u223c 780 \xbaC and may facilitate the liquid phase sintering of the rest of the material with significant grain growth. In b, we can see how the sillenite-like phase accumulates along the grains of BFO-Zr1 and leaves large pores, even a few micrometers thick, after sintering at 835 \xbaC. However, sintering temperatures below 780 \xbaC were insufficient to enable optimal grain growth and densification of the ceramics. It was later found that an increase in Zr concentration hindered the grain growth, and thus BFO-Zr1 sample was possible to sinter at 835 \xbaC as the other lanthanum-doped samples. This example only shows that, due to the instability of BFO close to the sintering temperature, it is impossible to achieve pure phase ceramics with a high density. SEM analysis carried out by back-scattered imaging of the sintered samples\u2019 surface was presented in. The values of the samples\u2019 average grain size (AGS) are given in. In the series BFO, BFO-Zr0.2 and BFO-Zr1, the average grain size of BFO-Zr1 is the largest due to the higher sintering temperature (835 \xb0C) compared to BFO and BFO-0.2 (780 \xb0C). Since electronegativity values of La (1.10) and Zr (1.33) are much lower than those of Bi (2.02) and Fe (1.83), we may assume that they make the stronger bonds with oxygen ions and thus slow down the diffusivity of the ions during sintering. However, the influence of Zr was much more expressed, if we compare the AGS of BFO-La10, BFO-La10-Zr1, and BFO-La15. a shows the experimentally obtained XRD patterns of Bi1-xLaxFe1-yZryO3 +\u03b4 samples. Both mullite-like (Bi2Fe4O9, S.G. Pbam) and sillenite-like (Bi25-xFeO39 -\u03b4, S.G. I23) phases are present in pure BFO and even more in BFO samples doped with zirconium. However, doping with lanthanum (x = 0.10) stabilizes the perovskite structure, not allowing the formation of the sillenite phase, while only traces of the mullite phase are present. Since the amount of these secondary phases is insignificant, even when no lanthanum is present, the XRD patterns were refined in the space group R3c, applying a one-phase model, except for those with x = 0.15, where a two-phase model containing one rhombohedral (R3c) and one orthorhombic (Pnam) BFO phase was introduced (b). summarizes the changes in refined lattice parameters a h and c h and unit cell volumes, considering the most common and stable crystal structure for La- and/or Zr-doped BiFeO3 (S.G. R3c) at ambient conditions. For the samples without LaE^{3+} ions in the BiFeO3 structure, the volume of the unit cell increases with zirconium doping, from V = 373.6 \xc5E^{3} for pure BiFeO3, to V = 374.2 \xc5E^{3} for BFO-Zr1. Thus, the volumes of V \u223c 372 \xc5E^{3} and V \u223c 371 \xc5E^{3} were obtained for La content of 10 mol% and 15 mol%, respectively, and are almost independent of Zr-doping. R3c) changed in the interval: a h = (5.576\u20135.581) \xc5 and c h = (13.776\u201313.875) \xc5. At the same time, the influence of La- and/or Zr-doping of BiFeO3 has more impact on the oxygen displacements inside the unit cell, while the fractional coordinates of the FeE^{3+} ions stay less affected by doping. The change in the crystallite size (DXRD) and lattice strain with LaE^{3+} and/or ZrE^{4+} doping, estimated by applying the Halder-Wagner method (HW) is shown in e. The crystallite size decreased with an increase in ZrE^{4+} and LaE^{3+} concentrations. The drop in the crystallite size below 40 nm was notable for the co-doped samples with 1 mol% Zr. These samples also exhibited the highest lattice strain values of \u223c 0.3 %. The Fourier transformed infra-red spectra were presented in , with characteristic bands that represent bending and stretching vibrations of BiO and FeO bonds in the wavenumber range between 400 and 900 cmE^{\u20131}. Applying Hook\u2019s law, one can express the relation between the force constant and the wavenumber (\u03bd) of the characteristic band: where c is the speed of light and \u03bc is the reduced mass of the bonded atoms: and m O and m M are the atomic weights of O and M (either Bi or Fe, depending on the observed bond). The calculated values of 2.01 \xc5 (540 cmE^{\u20131}) and 2.06 \xc5 (520 cmE^{\u20131}) can relate to the stretching vibrations of Fe-O according to the values calculated by XRD analysis. It implies that the corresponding bonds become shorter, which complies with the XRD results, where the unit cell volume decreases with La-doping. The much lower electronegativity of La (1.10) than that of Bi (2.02), which introduces a more ionic character (shorter lengths) of the bonds, can also be the reason, keeping in mind that their ionic radii are approximately equal. On the other hand, in the region 440\u2013420 cmE^{\u20131}, the calculated values for the BiO bonds (2.17\u20132.24 \xc5) and FeO bonds (2.29\u20132.37 \xc5) correlate well with the values provided by XRD analysis. The band around 814 cmE^{\u20131} is related to vibrations of FeO bonds in the FeO4 tetrahedra of the Bi2Fe4O9 phase. The intensity of this band becomes lower as La content increases, which also correlates well with the XRD results. A weakly expressed band around 670 cmE^{\u20131} can relate to the vibrations of the BiO bonds, as some authors claim. The samples BFO, BFO-Zr0.2, and BFO-Zr1 could not withstand electric fields above 20 kV/cm , much lower than necessary for ferroelectric switching. Although this light doping on the Fe site was efficient in the case of Nb , the main drawback of this approach is that even the concentration of Zr or Nb above 1 mol% led to the formation of precipitate during the synthesis, and therefore higher concentrations were not considered. On the other hand, the introduction of La significantly improved both the electric and the ferroelectric properties of BFO. In , the leakage current measurements revealed that the series of the samples doped with 15 mol% La was even more persistent at higher electric fields compared with the series with 10 mol% La, and for the most range of electric fields applied, they exhibited lower conductivity. The breakdown of the samples usually happened when the leakage currents exceeded 10E^{\u22124} A/cmE^{2}. Doping with Zr contributed to persistence and somewhat lower conductivity of the samples with 10 mol% La, but its effect diminished in the samples with 15 mol% La, probably due to the higher differences in concentrations of the dopants. Thus, the doping with lanthanum enhanced the stability of BiFeO3 in terms of lower leakage currents and lower amounts of secondary phases. Furthermore, the crystal lattice of bismuth ferrite can tolerate much higher concentrations of La than Zr, although some traces of new phases appeared in the samples with 15 mol% La. As for the electric properties, the beneficial effect of La-doping lies in a reduced ability of BiE^{3+} ions to evaporate if part LaE^{3+} ions replaces them. Evaporation of BiE^{3+} and formation of its vacancies is accompanied by other structural defects, such as oxygen vacancies and reduction of FeE^{3+} to FeE^{2+}, according to the following simplification expressed by the Kr\xf6ger-Vink notation:  In real systems, the situation might be far more complicated, as pointed out by recent investigations that discovered other defect groups, such as Bi-O or Fe-O divacancies , or the presence of FeE^{4+} at domain walls. Nevertheless, the concentration of these defects decreases with La doping, even the amount of FeE^{2+} decreases, as often confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The sample BFO-La15 even reached saturation at fields above 150 kV/cm, which is rarely seen in BFO ceramics. At the same time, this sample persisted at the highest electric field applied of 160 kV/cm due to its lowest conductivity compared to the other samples. The sample BFO-La10, however, exhibited higher remnant polarization than BFO-La15 if we compare their hysteresis loops measured at 130 kV/cm. The dipole switching occurred at fields around 80 kV/cm (coercive field) for the BFO-La10, while it required about 100 kV/cm for the BFO-La15. The result is that, in our case, the samples with 15 mol% La could tolerate higher electric fields and reach higher ferroelectric polarizations. This change is more pronounced in the La10 series, due to the lower La/Zr molar ratio and consequently higher effect of Zr in those samples. However, it is surprising that even such small concentrations of Zr can completely deteriorate the ferroelectric properties of BFO, and transform them from almost proper or leaky ferroelectric (BFO-La15 and BFO-La10) to predominantly leaky dielectric (BFO-La15-Zr1 and BFO-La10-Zr1). It is particularly noticeable for BFO-La10-Zr1, which is even less conductive than BFO-La10 in most range of the electric fields applied. The remanent-only polarization hysteresis loop combines two simple hysteresis loops, Logic 1 and Logic 0. Logic 1 involves a preset pulse that sets the sample to an opposite polarization polarity, while Logic 0 uses a preset pulse with the same polarity as in the hysteresis task. Thus, Logic 1 contains both remanent and non-remanent polarization, while Logic 0 contains only non-remanent polarization because the preset pulse has switched all the dipoles in the sample, and the preceding hysteresis pulse can provide only non-ferroelectric responses. Subtracting Logic 0 from Logic 1 gives the remanent-only hysteresis loop. In a we can see that remnant ferroelectric polarization (P r) of the BFO-La15 sample is 24 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, which is much higher than the usual values found in the literature for BFO-based ceramics. It is close to the value of the uncut hysteresis loop, which implies that the contributions of non-ferroelectric effects are low (\u223c 11 %). If we exclude the samples doped with Zr, the share of non-ferroelectric contributions increased for BFO-La10 (\u223c 29 %), which is reasonable due to a higher contribution of the electric polarization. BFO-La15-Zr0.2 sample still maintained good ferroelectric properties: Pr value of 19 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, and \u223c 27 % share of the non-ferroelectric contributions, while Pr of BFO-La1O-Zr0.2 significantly dropped, and the share of non-ferroelectric contributions exceeded 50 %. However, the Pr value of \u223c 5 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} is still high compared with the literature data for similar systems. The ferroelectric properties of the samples co-doped with 1 mol% Zr are poor, both in the case of the La10 and La15 series. The values of the piezoelectric coefficient (d 33), measured after poling at maximum electric fields, followed the similar pattern to the remnant ferroelectric polarizations. If we look at the hysteresis loops in , the so-called \u201cdipole switching\u201d occurred at the electric fields between 80 and 100 kV/cm (coercive electric fields), which was not the case with the samples co-doped with 1 mol% Zr. Again, the BFO-La15 sample showed the best piezoelectric properties with a d 33 value of 34 pC/N after poling at 160 kV/cm during 1 s. Even though this value is significantly lower than those of most common piezoelectrics , it is comparable with the results of Lv and Wu , who investigated the piezoelectric properties of the Bi1\u2212ySmyFeO3 \u2212 xBiScO3 system. Finally, little attention should be paid to the influence of the microstructure on the ferroelectric properties of the BFO samples co-doped with La and Zr. As can be seen in , the AGS between 1.4 and 1.8 \u03bcm were characteristic for the samples without Zr, or co-doped with 0.2 mol% Zr. With the addition of 1 mol% Zr, these values become submicrons in size. Therefore, to increase its grain growth and get greater AGS values, the sample BFO-La15-Zr1 was sintered at 870 \xb0C for 3 h. Indeed, its AGS value went up from 74 \xb1 0.02 \u03bcm (835 \xb0C) to 1.19 \xb1 0.05 \u03bcm. As a consequence, the leakage current increased for that sample for almost two orders of magnitude ( a), and the breakdown of the sample happened above 130 kV/cm, which is lower than for the sample sintered at 835 \xb0C (above 150 kV/cm). When the slope (m) value is less than 1, the conductivity in the sample is governed by the grain boundary limited conduction mechanism. This region stretches up to 100 kV/cm for the sample sintered at 835 \xb0C, then immediately passes to the trap-filled conduction mechanism (m > 2). The grain boundary limited conduction in the sample sintered at 870 \xb0C stops at around 30 kV/cm, and then gradually transforms over the space charge limited conduction (1 < m < 2) to the trap-filled conduction mechanism. The value of remnant ferroelectric polarization measured at 130 kV/cm for the sample sintered at 870 \xb0C (b) is similar to the value measured at 150 kV/cm for the sample sintered at 835 \xb0C (b). It can be explained by the effect of abundant grain boundaries in the sample sintered at 835 \xb0C that decrease the conductivity and suppress the development of ferroelectric domains at lower electric fields. However, this effect seems negligible compared with the influence of La-doping on the ferroelectric properties of the BFO samples. As demonstrated in our case, Zr-doping deteriorates the ferroelectric properties, which is consistent with the study of Mukherjee et al. that reported a decline of ferroelectric properties of thin BFO films doped by Zr at much higher electric fields. The reason may be that the crystal lattice becomes more rigid by introducing ZrE^{4+} ions, with lower electronegativity (1.33) than FeE^{3+} (1.85), which implies stronger Zr-O bonds that make dipole movements difficult. A significant increase in lattice strain and decrease in the crystallite size of the samples doped with 1 mol% Zr (e) is concurrent with decline of their ferroelectric properties. Finally, the reason why doping with 1 mol% Zr can almost repeal improvements in ferroelectric properties made by doping with 15 mol% La can be explained by the disturbance of the antiferromagnetic ordering of the Fe spins caused by replacing them with Zr.

Both mullite-like (Bi2Fe4O9, S.G. Pbam) and sillenite-like (Bi25-xFeO39 -\u03b4, S.G. I23) phases are present in pure BFO and even more in BFO samples doped with zirconium.

For the samples without LaE^{3+} ions in the BiFeO3 structure, the volume of the unit cell increases with zirconium doping, from V = 373.6 \xc5E^{3} for pure BiFeO3, to V = 374.2 \xc5E^{3} for BFO-Zr1. Thus, the volumes of V \u223c 372 \xc5E^{3} and V \u223c 371 \xc5E^{3} were obtained for La content of 10 mol% and 15 mol%, respectively, and are almost independent of Zr-doping. R3c) changed in the interval: a h = (5.576\u20135.581) \xc5 and c h = (13.776\u201313.875) \xc5. At the same time, the influence of La- and/or Zr-doping of BiFeO3 has more impact on the oxygen displacements inside the unit cell, while the fractional coordinates of the FeE^{3+} ions stay less affected by doping. The change in the crystallite size (DXRD) and lattice strain with LaE^{3+} and/or ZrE^{4+} doping, estimated by applying the Halder-Wagner method (HW) is shown in e. The crystallite size decreased with an increase in ZrE^{4+} and LaE^{3+} concentrations. The drop in the crystallite size below 40 nm was notable for the co-doped samples with 1 mol% Zr. These samples also exhibited the highest lattice strain values of \u223c 0.3 %. The Fourier transformed infra-red spectra were presented in , with characteristic bands that represent bending and stretching vibrations of BiO and FeO bonds in the wavenumber range between 400 and 900 cmE^{\u20131}. Applying Hook\u2019s law, one can express the relation between the force constant and the wavenumber (\u03bd) of the characteristic band: where c is the speed of light and \u03bc is the reduced mass of the bonded atoms: and m O and m M are the atomic weights of O and M (either Bi or Fe, depending on the observed bond). The calculated values of 2.01 \xc5 (540 cmE^{\u20131}) and 2.06 \xc5 (520 cmE^{\u20131}) can relate to the stretching vibrations of Fe-O according to the values calculated by XRD analysis. It implies that the corresponding bonds become shorter, which complies with the XRD results, where the unit cell volume decreases with La-doping. The much lower electronegativity of La (1.10) than that of Bi (2.02), which introduces a more ionic character (shorter lengths) of the bonds, can also be the reason, keeping in mind that their ionic radii are approximately equal. On the other hand, in the region 440\u2013420 cmE^{\u20131}, the calculated values for the BiO bonds (2.17\u20132.24 \xc5) and FeO bonds (2.29\u20132.37 \xc5) correlate well with the values provided by XRD analysis. The band around 814 cmE^{\u20131} is related to vibrations of FeO bonds in the FeO4 tetrahedra of the Bi2Fe4O9 phase. The intensity of this band becomes lower as La content increases, which also correlates well with the XRD results. A weakly expressed band around 670 cmE^{\u20131} can relate to the vibrations of the BiO bonds, as some authors claim. The samples BFO, BFO-Zr0.2, and BFO-Zr1 could not withstand electric fields above 20 kV/cm , much lower than necessary for ferroelectric switching. Although this light doping on the Fe site was efficient in the case of Nb , the main drawback of this approach is that even the concentration of Zr or Nb above 1 mol% led to the formation of precipitate during the synthesis, and therefore higher concentrations were not considered. On the other hand, the introduction of La significantly improved both the electric and the ferroelectric properties of BFO. In , the leakage current measurements revealed that the series of the samples doped with 15 mol% La was even more persistent at higher electric fields compared with the series with 10 mol% La, and for the most range of electric fields applied, they exhibited lower conductivity. The breakdown of the samples usually happened when the leakage currents exceeded 10E^{\u22124} A/cmE^{2}. Doping with Zr contributed to persistence and somewhat lower conductivity of the samples with 10 mol% La, but its effect diminished in the samples with 15 mol% La, probably due to the higher differences in concentrations of the dopants. Thus, the doping with lanthanum enhanced the stability of BiFeO3 in terms of lower leakage currents and lower amounts of secondary phases. Furthermore, the crystal lattice of bismuth ferrite can tolerate much higher concentrations of La than Zr, although some traces of new phases appeared in the samples with 15 mol% La. As for the electric properties, the beneficial effect of La-doping lies in a reduced ability of BiE^{3+} ions to evaporate if part LaE^{3+} ions replaces them. Evaporation of BiE^{3+} and formation of its vacancies is accompanied by other structural defects, such as oxygen vacancies and reduction of FeE^{3+} to FeE^{2+}, according to the following simplification expressed by the Kr\xf6ger-Vink notation:  In real systems, the situation might be far more complicated, as pointed out by recent investigations that discovered other defect groups, such as Bi-O or Fe-O divacancies , or the presence of FeE^{4+} at domain walls. Nevertheless, the concentration of these defects decreases with La doping, even the amount of FeE^{2+} decreases, as often confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The sample BFO-La15 even reached saturation at fields above 150 kV/cm, which is rarely seen in BFO ceramics. At the same time, this sample persisted at the highest electric field applied of 160 kV/cm due to its lowest conductivity compared to the other samples. The sample BFO-La10, however, exhibited higher remnant polarization than BFO-La15 if we compare their hysteresis loops measured at 130 kV/cm. The dipole switching occurred at fields around 80 kV/cm (coercive field) for the BFO-La10, while it required about 100 kV/cm for the BFO-La15. The result is that, in our case, the samples with 15 mol% La could tolerate higher electric fields and reach higher ferroelectric polarizations. This change is more pronounced in the La10 series, due to the lower La/Zr molar ratio and consequently higher effect of Zr in those samples. However, it is surprising that even such small concentrations of Zr can completely deteriorate the ferroelectric properties of BFO, and transform them from almost proper or leaky ferroelectric (BFO-La15 and BFO-La10) to predominantly leaky dielectric (BFO-La15-Zr1 and BFO-La10-Zr1). It is particularly noticeable for BFO-La10-Zr1, which is even less conductive than BFO-La10 in most range of the electric fields applied. The remanent-only polarization hysteresis loop combines two simple hysteresis loops, Logic 1 and Logic 0. Logic 1 involves a preset pulse that sets the sample to an opposite polarization polarity, while Logic 0 uses a preset pulse with the same polarity as in the hysteresis task. Thus, Logic 1 contains both remanent and non-remanent polarization, while Logic 0 contains only non-remanent polarization because the preset pulse has switched all the dipoles in the sample, and the preceding hysteresis pulse can provide only non-ferroelectric responses. Subtracting Logic 0 from Logic 1 gives the remanent-only hysteresis loop. In a we can see that remnant ferroelectric polarization (P r) of the BFO-La15 sample is 24 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, which is much higher than the usual values found in the literature for BFO-based ceramics. It is close to the value of the uncut hysteresis loop, which implies that the contributions of non-ferroelectric effects are low (\u223c 11 %). If we exclude the samples doped with Zr, the share of non-ferroelectric contributions increased for BFO-La10 (\u223c 29 %), which is reasonable due to a higher contribution of the electric polarization. BFO-La15-Zr0.2 sample still maintained good ferroelectric properties: Pr value of 19 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, and \u223c 27 % share of the non-ferroelectric contributions, while Pr of BFO-La1O-Zr0.2 significantly dropped, and the share of non-ferroelectric contributions exceeded 50 %. However, the Pr value of \u223c 5 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} is still high compared with the literature data for similar systems. The ferroelectric properties of the samples co-doped with 1 mol% Zr are poor, both in the case of the La10 and La15 series. The values of the piezoelectric coefficient (d 33), measured after poling at maximum electric fields, followed the similar pattern to the remnant ferroelectric polarizations. If we look at the hysteresis loops in , the so-called \u201cdipole switching\u201d occurred at the electric fields between 80 and 100 kV/cm (coercive electric fields), which was not the case with the samples co-doped with 1 mol% Zr. Again, the BFO-La15 sample showed the best piezoelectric properties with a d 33 value of 34 pC/N after poling at 160 kV/cm during 1 s. Even though this value is significantly lower than those of most common piezoelectrics , it is comparable with the results of Lv and Wu , who investigated the piezoelectric properties of the Bi1\u2212ySmyFeO3 \u2212 xBiScO3 system. Finally, little attention should be paid to the influence of the microstructure on the ferroelectric properties of the BFO samples co-doped with La and Zr. As can be seen in , the AGS between 1.4 and 1.8 \u03bcm were characteristic for the samples without Zr, or co-doped with 0.2 mol% Zr. With the addition of 1 mol% Zr, these values become submicrons in size. Therefore, to increase its grain growth and get greater AGS values, the sample BFO-La15-Zr1 was sintered at 870 \xb0C for 3 h. Indeed, its AGS value went up from 74 \xb1 0.02 \u03bcm (835 \xb0C) to 1.19 \xb1 0.05 \u03bcm. As a consequence, the leakage current increased for that sample for almost two orders of magnitude ( a), and the breakdown of the sample happened above 130 kV/cm, which is lower than for the sample sintered at 835 \xb0C (above 150 kV/cm). When the slope (m) value is less than 1, the conductivity in the sample is governed by the grain boundary limited conduction mechanism. This region stretches up to 100 kV/cm for the sample sintered at 835 \xb0C, then immediately passes to the trap-filled conduction mechanism (m > 2). The grain boundary limited conduction in the sample sintered at 870 \xb0C stops at around 30 kV/cm, and then gradually transforms over the space charge limited conduction (1 < m < 2) to the trap-filled conduction mechanism. The value of remnant ferroelectric polarization measured at 130 kV/cm for the sample sintered at 870 \xb0C (b) is similar to the value measured at 150 kV/cm for the sample sintered at 835 \xb0C (b). It can be explained by the effect of abundant grain boundaries in the sample sintered at 835 \xb0C that decrease the conductivity and suppress the development of ferroelectric domains at lower electric fields. However, this effect seems negligible compared with the influence of La-doping on the ferroelectric properties of the BFO samples. As demonstrated in our case, Zr-doping deteriorates the ferroelectric properties, which is consistent with the study of Mukherjee et al. that reported a decline of ferroelectric properties of thin BFO films doped by Zr at much higher electric fields. The reason may be that the crystal lattice becomes more rigid by introducing ZrE^{4+} ions, with lower electronegativity (1.33) than FeE^{3+} (1.85), which implies stronger Zr-O bonds that make dipole movements difficult. A significant increase in lattice strain and decrease in the crystallite size of the samples doped with 1 mol% Zr (e) is concurrent with decline of their ferroelectric properties. Finally, the reason why doping with 1 mol% Zr can almost repeal improvements in ferroelectric properties made by doping with 15 mol% La can be explained by the disturbance of the antiferromagnetic ordering of the Fe spins caused by replacing them with Zr.
