The bulk samples of lead-free Ba0.95Ca0.05Sn0.09Ti0.91O3 (BCST) ceramics were designed by sol-gel chemical method. Ba(CH3COO)2 (Merck, \u2265 99 % purity), Ca(CH3COO)2. xH2O (Merck, \u2265 95 % purity), Sn(CH3COO)2 (Sigma Aldrich, \u2265 99 % purity) and C16H36O4Ti (Merk, \u02c398 % purity) were employed as starting precursors. 2-ethylhexanoic acid (Sigma Aldrich, \u226598 % purity) was used as a solvent. The flow chart in depicts the sol gel method for synthesis of Ba0.95Ca0.05Sn0.09Ti0.91O3 ceramics. To begin with, the Barium acetate, calcium acetate and tin acetate were added in 2-ethylhexanoic acid in stoichiometric ratio and dissolved by heating the mixture at 80 \u02daC until clear solution was obtained. The desired stoichiometric quantity of C16H36O4Ti was mixed in the same solvent in separate beaker and then added to the previous solution. The final solution was then stirred and mixed for 1 h under continuous heating at temperature 80 \u02daC. Finally, the solution was dried so as to obtain BCST powder. The BCST powder was calcined at temperature 1000 \u02daC for 4 h in muffle furnace. The calcined powder was grinded in mortar pestle with 5 wt% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution until fine powder was obtained. The pellets of the grinded powder were prepared by compressing under 5 ton pressure. Finally, the pellets were sintered at two different temperatures 1100 and 1200 \u02daC for 5 h in order to get densified BCST ceramics samples. The BCST pellets were polished and coated with silver paste on both parallel faces in order to make electrical contact. The bulk density of the BCST sintered samples was estimated using Archimedes principle. The powder X-ray diffractometer (Panalytical Empyrean) was utilized to confirm the phase structure of BCST samples. The field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, HITACHISU8010 SERIES) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (BRUKER XFLASH 6I30) were employed to examine the surface morphology and elemental composition of BCST samples respectively. The Raman spectra of the samples were recorded by employing Renishaw Micro Raman Spectroscopy and chemical bonding of the BCST samples were investigated using FTIR spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer Spectrometer 65). The P-E hysteresis loops were measured by using PE Loop test system (20PE 1 kHz, Marine India) at different temperature.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a) depicts the XRD patterns of BCST samples sintered at two different temperatures i.e. 1100 and 1200 \u02daC. The XRD patterns verify that pure perovskite phase emerges for both BCST samples without formation of any secondary phase. The standard XRD patterns of pure tetragonal phase of BaTiO3 ceramics (PDF#812203) display as the vertical lines with their corresponding hkl planes on the horizontal axis in (a). Comparison of XRD patterns with the standard data confirms the well substitution of both CaE^{2+} and SnE^{4+} ions at their respective sites of BaTiO3 lattice. The enlarged view of peaks around 2\u03b8 \u223c 45\u02da and \u223c 66\u02da for both the samples are shown in the top right of (a). A single distorted peak around 2\u03b8 \u223c 45\u02da suggests pseudo cubic phase evolution in both the samples due to the substitutions of SnE^{4+} at B sites. The SnE^{4+} has larger ionic radii (0.71 \xc5) than TiE^{4+} (0.68 \xc5) which expands lattice parameters a and b of O-symmetry along c-axis. This strong overlapping of hidden peaks associated with different phases results in asymmetrical and distorted diffraction peak around 2\u03b8 \u223c 45\u02da and indicates the presence of multiple phases simultaneously. Therefore, the deconvolution of the peak at 2\u03b8 \u223c 45\u02da is carried out using Lorentzian function. The three peaks correspond to (002), (022) and (200) planes fit perfectly in the observed XRD patterns as shown in the (b)-(c). Such deconvolution has also been reported by Mezzourh et al. and verifies the concurrence of tetragonal and orthorhombic phases around room temperature for both BCST samples. Further, the presence of orthorhombic phase is also confirmed by the deconvolution of diffraction peak around 2\u03b8 \u223c 66\u02da into three different peaks and are displayed in the (d)-(e). The concurrence of tetragonal (T) and orthorhombic (O) phases suggests the evolution of MPB in these samples around room temperature. The Rietveld refinement of experimentally observed XRD patterns is another powerful technique to investigate multiphase coexistence. Thus, the Rietveld refinement of the XRD patterns has been carried out by Full-proof software using two phase model consisting of O-T phases with their space groups P4mm and Amm2 respectively. The (a) and (b) show the Rietveld refined XRD patterns for BCST samples sintered at 1100 and 1200\u02daC respectively. The experimental XRD pattern is perfectly fitted with the theoretical model and \u03c7E^{2} values which indicate quality of fit, are well below 1.5 as shown in. The other refinement parameters such as Rp, Rwp and Rexp are also observed below 15 suggesting consistent fitting of experimental XRD data. It is interesting to note that the c/a ratio decreases as the sintering temperature increases from 1100 to 1200 \u02daC. The percentage of tetragonal phase decreases from 53 % to 51 % while the orthorhombic phase percentage increases from 47 % to 49 % as the sintering temperature rises from 1100 to 1200 \u02daC. MPB evolution in these samples and is also consistent with the earlier reports. The refined crystal parameters and atomic structure of tetragonal phase (P4mm) can be drawn from the VESTA software and are displayed in the (a)-(b). The crystallite size can be computed using Debye- Scherrer\u2019s formula and is found to increase from 48.2 to 61.3 nm as the sintering temperature rises from 1100 to 1200 \u02daC. The FESEM micrograph and grain size distribution histogram for both BCST samples sintered at 1100 and 1200 \u02daC are illustrated in (a)-(b) respectively. lists the average grain size values, which were calculated using ImageJ software. The porosity percentage of the ceramics can be determined using the relation ( \u03c1 theor.\u2212 \u03c1 exp. \u03c1 theor.)\xd7100 and is found to decrease from 30.15 % to 7.8 % as sintering temperature rises from 1100 to 1200 \u02daC. The bulk density also increases from 4.19 g/cmE^{3} (relative density > 69 %) to 5.54 g/cmE^{3} (relative density > 90 %) and the behavior is consistent with the FESEM micrograph analysis. In addition, the elemental composition of the BCST samples has been determined using energy dispersive spectra (EDS) and the spectra are displayed in the (c)-(d). The carbon tape background and Au coating employed to develop electrical contact result in minor peak around 2.1 keV in the EDS spectra. The theoretical (in the parenthesis) and observed atomic percentage of various elements are illustrated in pie-chart to describe elemental composition distribution in the BCST samples. shows the FTIR spectra of BCST samples sintered at different temperatures i.e. at 1100 and 1200 \u02daC. The absorption peak around 575 cmE^{\u22121} is due to the Ti-O and Sn-O asymmetrical band stretching which otherwise appears around 496 cmE^{\u22121} in pure BaTiO3 ceramic. Such shift in the peak position is due to the variation in the bond energy of TiO6 octahedra because of SnE^{4+} substitution at B sites. Similar observation has been also reported for Zr substituted BaTiO3 ceramics. The absorption peak also suggests the emergence of tetragonal phase in the BCST samples. The bands around 1033 and 1443 cmE^{\u22121} correspond to the carbonate group and is due to the carbonate complex formation during atmosphere CO2 contact with BaTiO3 system. Whereas, the absorption peak around 2930 cmE^{\u22121} is due to the surface deposited CO2 fails to form carbonate complexes. The absorption band around 3430 cmE^{\u22121} corresponds to the distortion and O-H bond stretching. (a) shows Raman spectra of both BCST samples sintered at two different temperatures. The tetragonal symmetry of BaTiO3 ceramics exhibits 3 F1 u and 1 F2 u optical modes in irreducible representation. These modes are divided into longitudinal optic (LO) and transverse optic (TO) modes. There are total 15 Raman active modes composed of 3[A1(TO)+A1(LO)] + 4[E(TO)+E(LO)] + B1. In BaTiO3 ceramics some modes become more pronounce and specifically indicate tetragonal and orthorhombic phase evolution. For instance, the band E(LO2) around 300 cmE^{\u22121} represents tetragonal phase and the mode related to orthorhombic phase of BaTiO3 occurs at 185 cmE^{\u22121}. In the observed Raman spectra of BCST samples both modes appear around 301 cmE^{\u22121} and 186 cmE^{\u22121} respectively which suggest the multiphase coexistence of tetragonal and orthorhombic phases. It can be seen that the mode corresponds to orthorhombic phase becomes more pronounce for samples sintered at temperature 1200\u02daC and is consistent with the Rietveld refinement analysis. The A1(TO1) and A1(TO2) modes interfere to give anti resonance effect and evolves a sharp dip around 150 cmE^{\u22121}. The E(LO1), E(TO2), A1(LO1) and A1(TO1) modes are attributed to the vibrations of BaE^{2+} and CaE^{2+} with respect to TiO6 octahedra. The band [E(LO4), A1(LO3)] around 715 cmE^{\u22121} represents the phonon propagation in ab plane and along c-axis. The Raman spectra of BCST samples further confirms the MPB evolution with O-T phase coexistence and presence of polar nano regions (PNRs) in both the samples. (a)-(b) show UV-Vis absorption spectra of both the BCST samples sintered at temperature 1100 and 1200 \u02daC. The spectra revel two absorption bands at lower wavelength around 219 nm and 305 nm which means that both the samples are UV absorber. Such strong absorption bands in UV region are associated with the intrinsic transition between conduction band and valance band. Further, the absorption spectrum sharply decreases up to 400 nm and then remains almost saturated with the wavelength variation. The optical band gap energy (Eg) can be calculated by utilizing Tauc relationship given as follows Where \u03b1, Eg, h\u03bd shows the absorption coefficient, band gap energy, photon energy respectively and B is a constant. The exponent n represents type of transition i.e. n = 2 for direct transition and n=1/2 for indirect transition that are allowed. As reported, the BaTiO3 exhibits indirect transitions with n=1/2 in the Tauc equation. The Tauc plots are displayed in the insets of (a) and (b) respectively for the samples sintered at 1100 and 1200 \u02daC. The observed values of energy band gap are 3.18 and 3.16 eV for the BCST sample sintered at 1100 and 1200 \u02daC respectively. The band gap of BaTiO3 is 3.2 eV and CaE^{2+} and SnE^{4+} substitution slightly decreases the band gap to 3.18 and 3.16 for the BCST samples sintered at 1100 and 1200 \u02daC respectively. However, as reported by Selvaraj et al. , the substitution by SnE^{4+} causes no such significant impact on the optical properties of BCST samples. (a) \u2013 (b) show the temperature dependent dielectric constant and tan loss characteristics of the BCST ceramics sintered at temperatures 1100 and 1200 \u02daC respectively. The dielectric constant and tangent loss measurements were carried out over frequencies from 1.15 kHz to 1.15 MHz. The dielectric constant increases with increasing temperature, maximize around 45 \u02daC and then gradually decreases with further temperature rise for both samples. Additionally, it is noted that the dielectric constant decreases with increasing frequency from 1.15 kHz to 1.15 MHz. The room temperature dielectric constant values are measured as 970 and 1615 for the BCST ceramics sintered at temperature 1100 and 1200 \u02daC respectively. The tan loss is well below 0.04 for both samples. As observed in FESEM analysis that the porosity of the sample reduces and density improves with the rise in the sintering temperature. Consequently, the sample sintered at 1200 \xb0C exhibits a high dielectric constant due to a minimized concentration of oxygen vacancies, as indicated by Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. In contrast, the sample sintered at 1100 \xb0C suffers from relatively poor density, less refined grain structure and a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies, exhibits a lower dielectric constant. A notable observation is the effect of crystallite size and its distribution on the dielectric properties of lead-free BCST ceramics. The increase in crystallite size from 48.2 to 61.3 nm and narrower size distribution lead to enhanced dielectric constant from 970 and 1615 with increasing sintering temperature from 1100 to 1200 \xb0C. It is worth noting here that a broader peak is observed for both samples around 50 \u02daC which corresponds to the Curie temperature (Tc) associated with the ferroelectric (FE) to paraelectric (PE) phase transition. The sample sintered at 1100 \u02daC shows a single dielectric anomaly around Tc suggesting absence of MPB evolution or phase coexistence. The observation of broader dielectric peak indicates the presence of PNRs in the sample. In contrast, the sample sintered at 1200 \u02daC exhibits an additional minor dielectric anomaly around \u22122 \u02daC with FE-PE transition around 50 \u02daC. The additional phase transition anomaly around \u22122 \u02daC is associated with the orthorhombic to tetragonal phase i.e. TO-T. Therefore, orthorhombic and tetragonal phase coexistence reveals evolution of MPB in sample sintered at higher temperature and is consistent with the Rietveld refinement analysis of the XRD results. The MPB evolution have also been reported in the literature for BCST ceramics. It means that both the BCST ceramics exhibit relaxor characteristics with diffused phase transition (DPT). The DPT or relaxor behavior emerges due to structural inhomogeneity (due to substitution of TiE^{4+} by SnE^{4+} at B-site) which breaks the macroscopic long range ferroelectric order and results in the emergence of vibrant PNRs. Where, \u0190max is the maximum value of \u0190r with corresponding temperature Tmax, C is a Curie constant and \u03b3 shows the degree of diffuseness. The \u03b3 = 1 represents ideal ferroelectric i.e. follows Curie-Weiss law, \u03b3 = 2 corresponds to complete relaxor and incomplete DPT for 1< \u03b3 < 2. The (c)-(d) show the fitting of the ln(1/ \u03b5r \u2013 1/ \u03b5max) vs ln(T \u2013 Tmax) curves at frequency 1 kHz. The observed \u03b3 values are 2.43 and 2.13 as obtained by linear fitting for samples sintered at temperatures at 1100 and 1200 \u02daC respectively. The analysis confirms the presence of relaxor behavior in both BCST ceramics. The relaxor behavior and MPB evolution are useful in improving thermal stability of the electrocaloric temperature change and energy storage performance of the BCST ceramics. (a)-(b) depicts thermal evolution of Polarization with electric field (P-E hysteresis loop) of BCST samples densified at sintering temperatures of 1100 and 1200 \u02daC respectively. The P-E loop measurement was performed after polling these samples in silicon oil by applying dc field of 3.5 kV/cm for 1 h. The P-E loops were recorded by applying 30 kV/cm of electric field and at frequency 50 Hz. The slim hysteresis loops usually emerge due to the formation of PNRs as a result of chemical heterogeneity introduces by CaE^{2+} and SnE^{4+} substitutions. The characteristic size of emerged PNRs remains quite smaller as compare to ordinary macroscopic ferroelectric domains. As a result of their smaller sizes the PNRs are easier to reorient than that of normal macroscopic ferroelectric domains and leads to the emergence of slimmer hysteresis loop. The maximum polarization (Pmax), remnant Polarization (Pr), coercive field (Ec) and charge storage density (Qc) are listed in for both BCST ceramics. The sample sintered at lower temperature i.e. 1100 \u02daC shows very low value of polarization which is due to relatively large porosity and low density of the sample. On the other hand, increasing sintering temperature improves the microstructure and reduces porosity of the sample densified at 1200 \u02daC. Consequently, the sample sintered at 1200 \u02daC exhibits enhanced ferroelectric response. In addition, the presence of MPB evolution in the samples sintered at 1200 \u02daC also contributes to maximize the polarization as well as Qc values and are more desired to improve the electrocaloric and energy storage performances. The Indirect method was employed in order to calculate the electrocaloric response of BCST samples. The P-E loops were measured at different temperatures from 34 to 80 \u02daC at 50 Hz of frequency by applying maximum electric field \xb130 kV/cm during cooling process. The temperature associated P-E hysteresis loop data were utilized to estimate the ECE. (a)-(b) show thermal evolution of polarization i.e. P-T curves at various values of applied electric field for the BCST samples sintered at 1100 and 1200 \u02daC respectively. The indirect method of ECE employs Maxwell relation i.e. (\u2202P/\u2202T)E = (\u2202S/\u2202E)T in order to quantify the electrocaloric temperature change (\u0394T) and entropy change (\u0394S) as given by following relations. Where, Cp is the specific heat of the material,\u03c1 is the bulk density, (dP/dT)E is the pyroelectric coefficient of the sample and E1 and E2 are the initial and final electric fields respectively. Cp \u223c 0.4 JgE^{\u22121}KE^{\u22121} is substituted for the BCST samples and observed density values are 4.19 and 5.54 g/cmE^{3} respectively for samples sintered at 1100 and 1200 \u02daC respectively. The dP/dT curves for sample sintered at 1100 \u02daC show no correlation because of its poor density. On the other side, the sample sintered at higher temperature shows a broader peak over a wide temperature span which is due to FE-PE phase transition around 50 \u02daC. It is worth noting here that, the sample sintered at 1200 \u02daC exhibits sharp fall in dP/dT curve response between 30 and 40 \u02daC. This fall may be due to the possibility of another peak around \u22125\u20130 \u02daC below measured temperature range associated with the O-T phase transition and could not be realized here due to experimental limitation. However, Rietveld refinement of XRD pattern and dielectric analysis for the sample discussed before confirm its O-T phase transition. The adiabatic temperature change (\u2206T) and isothermal entropy change (\u2206S) were calculated by and and shown in the (a)-(d) for both samples. The broader peaks of \u2206T and \u2206S are observed for both samples due to the contribution of two phase transitions i.e. The \u2206T and \u2206S maxima shift towards higher temperature ranges with rise in applied electric field. The maximum values of \u2206T and \u2206S obtained at applied electric field 30 kV/cm are listed in. Relatively a low electrocaloric response of the sample sintered at 1100 \u02daC is due to its inferior microstructural features in terms of greater porosity and lower density. However, the sample sintered at 1200 \u02daC exhibits relatively higher \u2206T \u223c 0.42 K and \u2206S \u223c 0.52 J/kgK under low applied electric field of 30 kV/cm. (a)-(d) display electrocaloric coefficients (\u0394T/\u0394E) and (\u0394S/\u0394E) for both samples and observed maximum values of (\u0394T/\u0394E) are listed in the. The maximum values of (\u0394S/\u0394E) observed for both samples are 0.03 and 0.17 J.mm/K.kg.kV. Patel at al. investigated the ECE in BaTi0.87Sn0.13O3 ceramics and reported \u0394T \u223c 0.3 K at 60 \u02daC under applied electric field of 21.5 kV/cm with electrocaloric coefficient \u0394T/\u0394E \u223c 0.14 K.mm/kV by using indirect approach. The 0.88(Na0.5Bi0.5)TiO3-0.05SrTiO3-0.07(K0.5Na0.5)NbO3 system developed by Su et al. have achieved \u0394T \u223c 0.71 K at 30 \u02daC under 40 kV/cm applied electric field, owing to the relaxor behavior associated non-ergodic to ergodic phase transition around RT. In general, large \u0394T response at room temperature under low applied electric field is desired for the practical realization of electrocaloric cooling technology. The better optimization of cumulative effect of various parameters such as processing method, synthesis conditions including calcination and sintering, grain morphology, site engineering, MPB and of course the breakdown strength of material, are crucial prerequisites in order to develop efficient green electrocaloric technology. , illustrate a comparison of observed electrocaloric effect of our BCST samples with more recent reported works by others on various modified BaTiO3 ceramics. Evidently, the observed results for our BCST ceramics are consistent to or even improved over the various reports available in literature. These findings manifest that BCST ceramic is expected to be potential material for electrocaloric cooling applications. The temperature dependent energy storage capabilities of BCST samples were explored by utilizing the P-E loop data recorded at different temperatures under electric field of 30 kV/cm. The energy storage of dielectric capacitors depends on the three main parameters i.e. recoverable energy density (Wrec), total energy density (Wtot) and efficiency (\u03b7). Meanwhile the Wrec can be measured by integrating the area between axis of polarization and upper part of hysteresis loop i.e.\u222b P r P max EdP, where Pmax is saturation polarization and Pr is remnant polarization. On the other hand, Wloss arises owing to the loss of energy during charging discharging of the dielectric capacitor and can be calculated by solving the integral given as\u222b 0 P max EdP. The efficiency (\u03b7 %) of energy conversion can be calculated by the relation given in. The relaxor ferroelectric exhibits lower Pr and Ec values and offers a slim hysteresis loop due to the emergence of PNRs. The PNRs facilitate the back switching i.e. domains respond swiftly to the applied electric field and offers lower Pr values. Further, the PNRs eradicate the domain clamping effect due to emergence of local electric field which reduces the Ec owing to their dispersed distribution. In other words, the emergence of PNRs leads to a slim hysteresis loop. The energy storage characteristics of both BCST samples are shown in the (b)-(c). Both the samples exhibit almost similar trends for Wrec, Wtot and similar characteristics curves for \u03b7. The recoverable energy density increases with increase in temperature and attains a maxima around 60 \u02daC i.e. approximately around Tc and then gradually decreases in case of the BCST sample sintered at temperature 1200 \u02daC. The maximum observed values of Wrec are 38 and 79 mJ/cmE^{3} and Wtot are 42 and 87 mJ/cmE^{3} with excellent conversion efficiency of 89 and 91 % for the BCST samples sintered at temperatures 1100 and 1200 \u02daC respectively. It is significant to note here that the energy storage performance for the BCST ceramics under present study has been measured at low applied electric field of 30 kV/cm unlikely to the usually tendency of measuring high recoverable energy density by applying electric field as possible just below material breakdown. Very recently, Zhipeng Li et al. have suggested observation of energy storage characteristics at significantly low electric field which eventually results in the high Wrec and \u03b7 in the ceramics. In view of this, the BCST ceramics under present study reveal substantially high energy density with conversion efficiency (\u03b7) more than 90 % at relatively low value of applied electric field of 30 kV/cm. summarizes the energy storage performance of the BCST ceramics in the present study and other BaTiO3-based ceramics recently reported in the literature. Lather et al. developed CuO:Ho2O3 doped Ba(Zr0.05Ti0.95)O3 ceramics by solid state reaction method and achieved 93.3 mJ/cmE^{3} recoverable energy density around room temperature. For sol-gel processed BaTi0.89Sn0.11O3 ceramics, Zahid et al. obtained Wrec \u223c 117 mJ/cmE^{3} with conversion efficiency 78 % under applied electric field of 35 kV/cm around room temperature. Besides, Hadouch et al. studied Ba0.95Ca0.05Ti0.89Sn0.11O3 ceramics and observed Wrec \u223c 107.2 mJ/cmE^{3} and \u03b7 more than 51 % due to coexistence of tetragonal and orthorhombic phase around ambient temperature at 30 kV/cm applied electric field. indicates that BCST ceramic in this study is a promising candidate for energy storage performance at lower applied electric field. This study, demonstrates that the BCST ceramics own potential competitiveness in sustainable electrocaloric cooling and energy storage applications. In summary, the substitution at both A and B sites by CaE^{2+} and SnE^{4+} in BaTiO3 ceramics enhances the electrocaloric and energy storage capabilities of lead-free BaTiO3 ceramics. The electrocaloric effect have significantly improved to \u2206T \u223c 0.42 K and \u2206S \u223c 0.52 J/kgK under low value of applied electric field i.e. 30 kV/cm with rise in sintering temperature to 1200 \u02daC. The same sample exhibits maximum Wrec \u223c79 mJ/cmE^{3} with excellent conversion efficiency of 91 % at relatively lower value of applied electric field of 30 kV/cm. The MPB evolution, enhanced random fields, smaller grains and relaxor behavior due to emergence of PNRs with rise in sintering temperature bestowed to significantly improve the ECE and energy storage characteristics of BCST ceramics at lower applied electric field. These results indicates that the BCST ceramics in fact perform better at lower applied electric field, lower sintering temperatures and could be a robust candidate for sustainable electrocaloric cooling technology and efficient green energy storage devices.

The bulk samples of lead-free Ba0.95Ca0.05Sn0.09Ti0.91O3 (BCST) ceramics were designed by sol-gel chemical method. Ba(CH3COO)2 (Merck, \u2265 99 % purity), Ca(CH3COO)2. xH2O (Merck, \u2265 95 % purity), Sn(CH3COO)2 (Sigma Aldrich, \u2265 99 % purity) and C16H36O4Ti (Merk, \u02c398 % purity) were employed as starting precursors. 2-ethylhexanoic acid (Sigma Aldrich, \u226598 % purity) was used as a solvent. The flow chart in depicts the sol gel method for synthesis of Ba0.95Ca0.05Sn0.09Ti0.91O3 ceramics. To begin with, the Barium acetate, calcium acetate and tin acetate were added in 2-ethylhexanoic acid in stoichiometric ratio and dissolved by heating the mixture at 80 \u02daC until clear solution was obtained. The desired stoichiometric quantity of C16H36O4Ti was mixed in the same solvent in separate beaker and then added to the previous solution. The final solution was then stirred and mixed for 1 h under continuous heating at temperature 80 \u02daC. Finally, the solution was dried so as to obtain BCST powder. The BCST powder was calcined at temperature 1000 \u02daC for 4 h in muffle furnace. The calcined powder was grinded in mortar pestle with 5 wt% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution until fine powder was obtained. The pellets of the grinded powder were prepared by compressing under 5 ton pressure. Finally, the pellets were sintered at two different temperatures 1100 and 1200 \u02daC for 5 h in order to get densified BCST ceramics samples. The BCST pellets were polished and coated with silver paste on both parallel faces in order to make electrical contact. The bulk density of the BCST sintered samples was estimated using Archimedes principle. The powder X-ray diffractometer (Panalytical Empyrean) was utilized to confirm the phase structure of BCST samples. The field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, HITACHISU8010 SERIES) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (BRUKER XFLASH 6I30) were employed to examine the surface morphology and elemental composition of BCST samples respectively. The Raman spectra of the samples were recorded by employing Renishaw Micro Raman Spectroscopy and chemical bonding of the BCST samples were investigated using FTIR spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer Spectrometer 65). The P-E hysteresis loops were measured by using PE Loop test system (20PE 1 kHz, Marine India) at different temperature.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a) depicts the XRD patterns of BCST samples sintered at two different temperatures i.e. 1100 and 1200 \u02daC. The XRD patterns verify that pure perovskite phase emerges for both BCST samples without formation of any secondary phase. The standard XRD patterns of pure tetragonal phase of BaTiO3 ceramics (PDF#812203) display as the vertical lines with their corresponding hkl planes on the horizontal axis in (a). Comparison of XRD patterns with the standard data confirms the well substitution of both CaE^{2+} and SnE^{4+} ions at their respective sites of BaTiO3 lattice. The enlarged view of peaks around 2\u03b8 \u223c 45\u02da and \u223c 66\u02da for both the samples are shown in the top right of (a). A single distorted peak around 2\u03b8 \u223c 45\u02da suggests pseudo cubic phase evolution in both the samples due to the substitutions of SnE^{4+} at B sites. The SnE^{4+} has larger ionic radii (0.71 \xc5) than TiE^{4+} (0.68 \xc5) which expands lattice parameters a and b of O-symmetry along c-axis. This strong overlapping of hidden peaks associated with different phases results in asymmetrical and distorted diffraction peak around 2\u03b8 \u223c 45\u02da and indicates the presence of multiple phases simultaneously. Therefore, the deconvolution of the peak at 2\u03b8 \u223c 45\u02da is carried out using Lorentzian function. The three peaks correspond to (002), (022) and (200) planes fit perfectly in the observed XRD patterns as shown in the (b)-(c). Such deconvolution has also been reported by Mezzourh et al. and verifies the concurrence of tetragonal and orthorhombic phases around room temperature for both BCST samples. Further, the presence of orthorhombic phase is also confirmed by the deconvolution of diffraction peak around 2\u03b8 \u223c 66\u02da into three different peaks and are displayed in the (d)-(e). The concurrence of tetragonal (T) and orthorhombic (O) phases suggests the evolution of MPB in these samples around room temperature. The Rietveld refinement of experimentally observed XRD patterns is another powerful technique to investigate multiphase coexistence. Thus, the Rietveld refinement of the XRD patterns has been carried out by Full-proof software using two phase model consisting of O-T phases with their space groups P4mm and Amm2 respectively. The (a) and (b) show the Rietveld refined XRD patterns for BCST samples sintered at 1100 and 1200\u02daC respectively. The experimental XRD pattern is perfectly fitted with the theoretical model and \u03c7E^{2} values which indicate quality of fit, are well below 1.5 as shown in. The other refinement parameters such as Rp, Rwp and Rexp are also observed below 15 suggesting consistent fitting of experimental XRD data. It is interesting to note that the c/a ratio decreases as the sintering temperature increases from 1100 to 1200 \u02daC. The percentage of tetragonal phase decreases from 53 % to 51 % while the orthorhombic phase percentage increases from 47 % to 49 % as the sintering temperature rises from 1100 to 1200 \u02daC. MPB evolution in these samples and is also consistent with the earlier reports. The refined crystal parameters and atomic structure of tetragonal phase (P4mm) can be drawn from the VESTA software and are displayed in the (a)-(b). The crystallite size can be computed using Debye- Scherrer\u2019s formula and is found to increase from 48.2 to 61.3 nm as the sintering temperature rises from 1100 to 1200 \u02daC. The FESEM micrograph and grain size distribution histogram for both BCST samples sintered at 1100 and 1200 \u02daC are illustrated in (a)-(b) respectively. lists the average grain size values, which were calculated using ImageJ software. The porosity percentage of the ceramics can be determined using the relation ( \u03c1 theor.\u2212 \u03c1 exp. \u03c1 theor.)\xd7100 and is found to decrease from 30.15 % to 7.8 % as sintering temperature rises from 1100 to 1200 \u02daC. The bulk density also increases from 4.19 g/cmE^{3} (relative density > 69 %) to 5.54 g/cmE^{3} (relative density > 90 %) and the behavior is consistent with the FESEM micrograph analysis. In addition, the elemental composition of the BCST samples has been determined using energy dispersive spectra (EDS) and the spectra are displayed in the (c)-(d). The carbon tape background and Au coating employed to develop electrical contact result in minor peak around 2.1 keV in the EDS spectra. The theoretical (in the parenthesis) and observed atomic percentage of various elements are illustrated in pie-chart to describe elemental composition distribution in the BCST samples. shows the FTIR spectra of BCST samples sintered at different temperatures i.e. at 1100 and 1200 \u02daC. The absorption peak around 575 cmE^{\u22121} is due to the Ti-O and Sn-O asymmetrical band stretching which otherwise appears around 496 cmE^{\u22121} in pure BaTiO3 ceramic. Such shift in the peak position is due to the variation in the bond energy of TiO6 octahedra because of SnE^{4+} substitution at B sites. Similar observation has been also reported for Zr substituted BaTiO3 ceramics. The absorption peak also suggests the emergence of tetragonal phase in the BCST samples. The bands around 1033 and 1443 cmE^{\u22121} correspond to the carbonate group and is due to the carbonate complex formation during atmosphere CO2 contact with BaTiO3 system. Whereas, the absorption peak around 2930 cmE^{\u22121} is due to the surface deposited CO2 fails to form carbonate complexes. The absorption band around 3430 cmE^{\u22121} corresponds to the distortion and O-H bond stretching. (a) shows Raman spectra of both BCST samples sintered at two different temperatures. The tetragonal symmetry of BaTiO3 ceramics exhibits 3 F1 u and 1 F2 u optical modes in irreducible representation. These modes are divided into longitudinal optic (LO) and transverse optic (TO) modes. There are total 15 Raman active modes composed of 3[A1(TO)+A1(LO)] + 4[E(TO)+E(LO)] + B1. In BaTiO3 ceramics some modes become more pronounce and specifically indicate tetragonal and orthorhombic phase evolution. For instance, the band E(LO2) around 300 cmE^{\u22121} represents tetragonal phase and the mode related to orthorhombic phase of BaTiO3 occurs at 185 cmE^{\u22121}. In the observed Raman spectra of BCST samples both modes appear around 301 cmE^{\u22121} and 186 cmE^{\u22121} respectively which suggest the multiphase coexistence of tetragonal and orthorhombic phases. It can be seen that the mode corresponds to orthorhombic phase becomes more pronounce for samples sintered at temperature 1200\u02daC and is consistent with the Rietveld refinement analysis. The A1(TO1) and A1(TO2) modes interfere to give anti resonance effect and evolves a sharp dip around 150 cmE^{\u22121}. The E(LO1), E(TO2), A1(LO1) and A1(TO1) modes are attributed to the vibrations of BaE^{2+} and CaE^{2+} with respect to TiO6 octahedra. The band [E(LO4), A1(LO3)] around 715 cmE^{\u22121} represents the phonon propagation in ab plane and along c-axis. The Raman spectra of BCST samples further confirms the MPB evolution with O-T phase coexistence and presence of polar nano regions (PNRs) in both the samples. (a)-(b) show UV-Vis absorption spectra of both the BCST samples sintered at temperature 1100 and 1200 \u02daC. The spectra revel two absorption bands at lower wavelength around 219 nm and 305 nm which means that both the samples are UV absorber. Such strong absorption bands in UV region are associated with the intrinsic transition between conduction band and valance band. Further, the absorption spectrum sharply decreases up to 400 nm and then remains almost saturated with the wavelength variation. The optical band gap energy (Eg) can be calculated by utilizing Tauc relationship given as follows Where \u03b1, Eg, h\u03bd shows the absorption coefficient, band gap energy, photon energy respectively and B is a constant. The exponent n represents type of transition i.e. n = 2 for direct transition and n=1/2 for indirect transition that are allowed. As reported, the BaTiO3 exhibits indirect transitions with n=1/2 in the Tauc equation. The Tauc plots are displayed in the insets of (a) and (b) respectively for the samples sintered at 1100 and 1200 \u02daC. The observed values of energy band gap are 3.18 and 3.16 eV for the BCST sample sintered at 1100 and 1200 \u02daC respectively. The band gap of BaTiO3 is 3.2 eV and CaE^{2+} and SnE^{4+} substitution slightly decreases the band gap to 3.18 and 3.16 for the BCST samples sintered at 1100 and 1200 \u02daC respectively. However, as reported by Selvaraj et al. , the substitution by SnE^{4+} causes no such significant impact on the optical properties of BCST samples. (a) \u2013 (b) show the temperature dependent dielectric constant and tan loss characteristics of the BCST ceramics sintered at temperatures 1100 and 1200 \u02daC respectively. The dielectric constant and tangent loss measurements were carried out over frequencies from 1.15 kHz to 1.15 MHz. The dielectric constant increases with increasing temperature, maximize around 45 \u02daC and then gradually decreases with further temperature rise for both samples. Additionally, it is noted that the dielectric constant decreases with increasing frequency from 1.15 kHz to 1.15 MHz. The room temperature dielectric constant values are measured as 970 and 1615 for the BCST ceramics sintered at temperature 1100 and 1200 \u02daC respectively. The tan loss is well below 0.04 for both samples. As observed in FESEM analysis that the porosity of the sample reduces and density improves with the rise in the sintering temperature. Consequently, the sample sintered at 1200 \xb0C exhibits a high dielectric constant due to a minimized concentration of oxygen vacancies, as indicated by Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. In contrast, the sample sintered at 1100 \xb0C suffers from relatively poor density, less refined grain structure and a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies, exhibits a lower dielectric constant. A notable observation is the effect of crystallite size and its distribution on the dielectric properties of lead-free BCST ceramics. The increase in crystallite size from 48.2 to 61.3 nm and narrower size distribution lead to enhanced dielectric constant from 970 and 1615 with increasing sintering temperature from 1100 to 1200 \xb0C. It is worth noting here that a broader peak is observed for both samples around 50 \u02daC which corresponds to the Curie temperature (Tc) associated with the ferroelectric (FE) to paraelectric (PE) phase transition. The sample sintered at 1100 \u02daC shows a single dielectric anomaly around Tc suggesting absence of MPB evolution or phase coexistence. The observation of broader dielectric peak indicates the presence of PNRs in the sample. In contrast, the sample sintered at 1200 \u02daC exhibits an additional minor dielectric anomaly around \u22122 \u02daC with FE-PE transition around 50 \u02daC. The additional phase transition anomaly around \u22122 \u02daC is associated with the orthorhombic to tetragonal phase i.e. TO-T. Therefore, orthorhombic and tetragonal phase coexistence reveals evolution of MPB in sample sintered at higher temperature and is consistent with the Rietveld refinement analysis of the XRD results. The MPB evolution have also been reported in the literature for BCST ceramics. It means that both the BCST ceramics exhibit relaxor characteristics with diffused phase transition (DPT). The DPT or relaxor behavior emerges due to structural inhomogeneity (due to substitution of TiE^{4+} by SnE^{4+} at B-site) which breaks the macroscopic long range ferroelectric order and results in the emergence of vibrant PNRs. Where, \u0190max is the maximum value of \u0190r with corresponding temperature Tmax, C is a Curie constant and \u03b3 shows the degree of diffuseness. The \u03b3 = 1 represents ideal ferroelectric i.e. follows Curie-Weiss law, \u03b3 = 2 corresponds to complete relaxor and incomplete DPT for 1< \u03b3 < 2. The (c)-(d) show the fitting of the ln(1/ \u03b5r \u2013 1/ \u03b5max) vs ln(T \u2013 Tmax) curves at frequency 1 kHz. The observed \u03b3 values are 2.43 and 2.13 as obtained by linear fitting for samples sintered at temperatures at 1100 and 1200 \u02daC respectively. The analysis confirms the presence of relaxor behavior in both BCST ceramics. The relaxor behavior and MPB evolution are useful in improving thermal stability of the electrocaloric temperature change and energy storage performance of the BCST ceramics. (a)-(b) depicts thermal evolution of Polarization with electric field (P-E hysteresis loop) of BCST samples densified at sintering temperatures of 1100 and 1200 \u02daC respectively. The P-E loop measurement was performed after polling these samples in silicon oil by applying dc field of 3.5 kV/cm for 1 h. The P-E loops were recorded by applying 30 kV/cm of electric field and at frequency 50 Hz. The slim hysteresis loops usually emerge due to the formation of PNRs as a result of chemical heterogeneity introduces by CaE^{2+} and SnE^{4+} substitutions. The characteristic size of emerged PNRs remains quite smaller as compare to ordinary macroscopic ferroelectric domains. As a result of their smaller sizes the PNRs are easier to reorient than that of normal macroscopic ferroelectric domains and leads to the emergence of slimmer hysteresis loop. The maximum polarization (Pmax), remnant Polarization (Pr), coercive field (Ec) and charge storage density (Qc) are listed in for both BCST ceramics. The sample sintered at lower temperature i.e. 1100 \u02daC shows very low value of polarization which is due to relatively large porosity and low density of the sample. On the other hand, increasing sintering temperature improves the microstructure and reduces porosity of the sample densified at 1200 \u02daC. Consequently, the sample sintered at 1200 \u02daC exhibits enhanced ferroelectric response. In addition, the presence of MPB evolution in the samples sintered at 1200 \u02daC also contributes to maximize the polarization as well as Qc values and are more desired to improve the electrocaloric and energy storage performances. The Indirect method was employed in order to calculate the electrocaloric response of BCST samples. The P-E loops were measured at different temperatures from 34 to 80 \u02daC at 50 Hz of frequency by applying maximum electric field \xb130 kV/cm during cooling process. The temperature associated P-E hysteresis loop data were utilized to estimate the ECE. (a)-(b) show thermal evolution of polarization i.e. P-T curves at various values of applied electric field for the BCST samples sintered at 1100 and 1200 \u02daC respectively. The indirect method of ECE employs Maxwell relation i.e. (\u2202P/\u2202T)E = (\u2202S/\u2202E)T in order to quantify the electrocaloric temperature change (\u0394T) and entropy change (\u0394S) as given by following relations. Where, Cp is the specific heat of the material,\u03c1 is the bulk density, (dP/dT)E is the pyroelectric coefficient of the sample and E1 and E2 are the initial and final electric fields respectively. Cp \u223c 0.4 JgE^{\u22121}KE^{\u22121} is substituted for the BCST samples and observed density values are 4.19 and 5.54 g/cmE^{3} respectively for samples sintered at 1100 and 1200 \u02daC respectively. The dP/dT curves for sample sintered at 1100 \u02daC show no correlation because of its poor density. On the other side, the sample sintered at higher temperature shows a broader peak over a wide temperature span which is due to FE-PE phase transition around 50 \u02daC. It is worth noting here that, the sample sintered at 1200 \u02daC exhibits sharp fall in dP/dT curve response between 30 and 40 \u02daC. This fall may be due to the possibility of another peak around \u22125\u20130 \u02daC below measured temperature range associated with the O-T phase transition and could not be realized here due to experimental limitation. However, Rietveld refinement of XRD pattern and dielectric analysis for the sample discussed before confirm its O-T phase transition. The adiabatic temperature change (\u2206T) and isothermal entropy change (\u2206S) were calculated by and and shown in the (a)-(d) for both samples. The broader peaks of \u2206T and \u2206S are observed for both samples due to the contribution of two phase transitions i.e. The \u2206T and \u2206S maxima shift towards higher temperature ranges with rise in applied electric field. The maximum values of \u2206T and \u2206S obtained at applied electric field 30 kV/cm are listed in. Relatively a low electrocaloric response of the sample sintered at 1100 \u02daC is due to its inferior microstructural features in terms of greater porosity and lower density. However, the sample sintered at 1200 \u02daC exhibits relatively higher \u2206T \u223c 0.42 K and \u2206S \u223c 0.52 J/kgK under low applied electric field of 30 kV/cm. (a)-(d) display electrocaloric coefficients (\u0394T/\u0394E) and (\u0394S/\u0394E) for both samples and observed maximum values of (\u0394T/\u0394E) are listed in the. The maximum values of (\u0394S/\u0394E) observed for both samples are 0.03 and 0.17 J.mm/K.kg.kV. Patel at al. investigated the ECE in BaTi0.87Sn0.13O3 ceramics and reported \u0394T \u223c 0.3 K at 60 \u02daC under applied electric field of 21.5 kV/cm with electrocaloric coefficient \u0394T/\u0394E \u223c 0.14 K.mm/kV by using indirect approach. The 0.88(Na0.5Bi0.5)TiO3-0.05SrTiO3-0.07(K0.5Na0.5)NbO3 system developed by Su et al. have achieved \u0394T \u223c 0.71 K at 30 \u02daC under 40 kV/cm applied electric field, owing to the relaxor behavior associated non-ergodic to ergodic phase transition around RT. In general, large \u0394T response at room temperature under low applied electric field is desired for the practical realization of electrocaloric cooling technology. The better optimization of cumulative effect of various parameters such as processing method, synthesis conditions including calcination and sintering, grain morphology, site engineering, MPB and of course the breakdown strength of material, are crucial prerequisites in order to develop efficient green electrocaloric technology. , illustrate a comparison of observed electrocaloric effect of our BCST samples with more recent reported works by others on various modified BaTiO3 ceramics. Evidently, the observed results for our BCST ceramics are consistent to or even improved over the various reports available in literature. These findings manifest that BCST ceramic is expected to be potential material for electrocaloric cooling applications. The temperature dependent energy storage capabilities of BCST samples were explored by utilizing the P-E loop data recorded at different temperatures under electric field of 30 kV/cm. The energy storage of dielectric capacitors depends on the three main parameters i.e. recoverable energy density (Wrec), total energy density (Wtot) and efficiency (\u03b7). Meanwhile the Wrec can be measured by integrating the area between axis of polarization and upper part of hysteresis loop i.e.\u222b P r P max EdP, where Pmax is saturation polarization and Pr is remnant polarization. On the other hand, Wloss arises owing to the loss of energy during charging discharging of the dielectric capacitor and can be calculated by solving the integral given as\u222b 0 P max EdP. The efficiency (\u03b7 %) of energy conversion can be calculated by the relation given in. The relaxor ferroelectric exhibits lower Pr and Ec values and offers a slim hysteresis loop due to the emergence of PNRs. The PNRs facilitate the back switching i.e. domains respond swiftly to the applied electric field and offers lower Pr values. Further, the PNRs eradicate the domain clamping effect due to emergence of local electric field which reduces the Ec owing to their dispersed distribution. In other words, the emergence of PNRs leads to a slim hysteresis loop. The energy storage characteristics of both BCST samples are shown in the (b)-(c). Both the samples exhibit almost similar trends for Wrec, Wtot and similar characteristics curves for \u03b7. The recoverable energy density increases with increase in temperature and attains a maxima around 60 \u02daC i.e. approximately around Tc and then gradually decreases in case of the BCST sample sintered at temperature 1200 \u02daC. The maximum observed values of Wrec are 38 and 79 mJ/cmE^{3} and Wtot are 42 and 87 mJ/cmE^{3} with excellent conversion efficiency of 89 and 91 % for the BCST samples sintered at temperatures 1100 and 1200 \u02daC respectively. It is significant to note here that the energy storage performance for the BCST ceramics under present study has been measured at low applied electric field of 30 kV/cm unlikely to the usually tendency of measuring high recoverable energy density by applying electric field as possible just below material breakdown. Very recently, Zhipeng Li et al. have suggested observation of energy storage characteristics at significantly low electric field which eventually results in the high Wrec and \u03b7 in the ceramics. In view of this, the BCST ceramics under present study reveal substantially high energy density with conversion efficiency (\u03b7) more than 90 % at relatively low value of applied electric field of 30 kV/cm. summarizes the energy storage performance of the BCST ceramics in the present study and other BaTiO3-based ceramics recently reported in the literature. Lather et al. developed CuO:Ho2O3 doped Ba(Zr0.05Ti0.95)O3 ceramics by solid state reaction method and achieved 93.3 mJ/cmE^{3} recoverable energy density around room temperature. For sol-gel processed BaTi0.89Sn0.11O3 ceramics, Zahid et al. obtained Wrec \u223c 117 mJ/cmE^{3} with conversion efficiency 78 % under applied electric field of 35 kV/cm around room temperature. Besides, Hadouch et al. studied Ba0.95Ca0.05Ti0.89Sn0.11O3 ceramics and observed Wrec \u223c 107.2 mJ/cmE^{3} and \u03b7 more than 51 % due to coexistence of tetragonal and orthorhombic phase around ambient temperature at 30 kV/cm applied electric field. indicates that BCST ceramic in this study is a promising candidate for energy storage performance at lower applied electric field. This study, demonstrates that the BCST ceramics own potential competitiveness in sustainable electrocaloric cooling and energy storage applications. In summary, the substitution at both A and B sites by CaE^{2+} and SnE^{4+} in BaTiO3 ceramics enhances the electrocaloric and energy storage capabilities of lead-free BaTiO3 ceramics. The electrocaloric effect have significantly improved to \u2206T \u223c 0.42 K and \u2206S \u223c 0.52 J/kgK under low value of applied electric field i.e. 30 kV/cm with rise in sintering temperature to 1200 \u02daC. The same sample exhibits maximum Wrec \u223c79 mJ/cmE^{3} with excellent conversion efficiency of 91 % at relatively lower value of applied electric field of 30 kV/cm. The MPB evolution, enhanced random fields, smaller grains and relaxor behavior due to emergence of PNRs with rise in sintering temperature bestowed to significantly improve the ECE and energy storage characteristics of BCST ceramics at lower applied electric field. These results indicates that the BCST ceramics in fact perform better at lower applied electric field, lower sintering temperatures and could be a robust candidate for sustainable electrocaloric cooling technology and efficient green energy storage devices.
