Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation', 'precursors': ['Mg', 'Na2SiO3', 'KF', 'NaOH', 'BaTiO3'], 'steps': ['Mechanically ground with SiC paper up to 1000 grit', 'Ultrasonically cleaned in ethyl alcohol', 'Dried in the cold air', 'PEO treatment with Mg as anode and stainless steel chamber as cathode at 2 A/dm^2 for 660 s under 500 Hz and 15% duty cycle', 'Solution was cooled down using a water-cooling system at 30 ± 5 °C', 'Rinsed in distilled water', 'Dried in warm air'], 'characterization_techniques': ['SEM', 'EDS', 'XRD', 'FTIR', 'Dielectric and Ferroelectric Testing System', 'Ferroelectric tester', 'Automatic pulling-off adhesion tester', 'Automatic microhardness measurement system', 'Microplate reader', 'UV spectrophotometer', 'ICP-OES', 'pH meter', 'Fluorescence spectrophotometer', 'Ultraviolet spectrophotometer', 'Electrochemical workstation', 'EIS']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
