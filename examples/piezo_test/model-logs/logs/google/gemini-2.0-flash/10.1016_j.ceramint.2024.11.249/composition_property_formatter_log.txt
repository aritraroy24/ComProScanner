**Description**: Format the extracted material composition and properties data. Focus on the 'Notes' if anything is provided. You MUST use 'MaterialParserTool' as tool if there is any variable in the composition in {'composition_extracted_data': {'compositions_property_values': {'Bi4Ti3O12/Chitosan/rGO with 25 wt% ceramic and 0.5 wt% graphene': 15.67, 'Bi4Ti3O12/Chitosan/rGO with 25 wt% ceramic and 0 wt% graphene': 14.04, 'Bi4Ti3O12/Chitosan/rGO with 0 wt% ceramic and 0.5 wt% graphene': 0, 'Bi4Ti3O12/Chitosan/rGO with 50 wt% ceramic and 0.5 wt% graphene': 28.21, 'Bi4Ti3O12/Chitosan/rGO with 7.32233 wt% ceramic and 0.853553 wt% graphene': 8.38, 'Bi4Ti3O12/Chitosan/rGO with 42.6777 wt% ceramic and 0.146447 wt% graphene': 18.57, 'Bi4Ti3O12/Chitosan/rGO with 25 wt% ceramic and 1 wt% graphene': 16.3, 'Bi4Ti3O12/Chitosan/rGO with 42.6777 wt% ceramic and 0.853553 wt% graphene': 24.82, 'Bi4Ti3O12/Chitosan/rGO with 7.32233 wt% ceramic and 0.146447 wt% graphene': 5.21}, 'abbreviations': {'BiTO': 'Bi4Ti3O12', 'rGO': 'reduced graphene oxide', 'Ch': 'Chitosan', 'PVDF': 'poly(vinylidene) fluoride', 'CNTs': 'carbon nanotubes', 'GO': 'graphene oxide'}, 'property_unit': 'pC/N', 'family': 'Bi4Ti3O12/Chitosan/rGO'}}. You MUST use the final output from the material parser tool as the final answer for such cases. Just resolve the variables - but don't do any final numerical calculation to get the composition percentage by yourself and keep the formula same as the original.
- If any abbreviated form of composition is present rewrite with the actual composition. But DON'T modify the chemical composition / periodic element with chemical name / element name for e.g., Bi should not be replaced with Bismuth or BaTiO3 should not be replaced with Barium titanate.
- If composition has variables with equation, after resolving the variable the formula should be written in a form of BODMAS rule with only () as brackets, + as addition, - as subtraction, * as multiplication and / as division. For e.g, ABx-2y/5C3 is a chemical formula, where A, B, C are periodic elements and x and y are variables with values x=2, y=3, the final chemical formula should be written as AB(2-((2*3)/5))O3 so that BODMAS rule can be applied later.
