Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'Solid-state reaction', 'precursors': ['BaCO3', 'SrCO3', 'TiO2', 'ZrO2'], 'steps': ['Mixed in stoichiometric ratios and subjected to ball milling in ethanol at 400 rpm for 12 h', 'Drying', 'Fired at 1200 °C for 2 h', 'Blended with 5 wt% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)', 'Compacted into discs by applying a pressure of 10 MPa', 'Ramped to 650 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min and held for 2 h to eliminate PVA', 'Heating to 1400 °C at 5 °C/min and sintering in the air for 3 h'], 'characterization_techniques': ['X-ray diffraction (XRD)', 'Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)', 'Dielectric thermospectrum meter', 'Ferroelectric tester', 'Quasi-static d 33 meter']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
