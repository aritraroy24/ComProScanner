Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'solvothermal', 'precursors': [], 'steps': ['Powders were pressed into pellets', 'Sintered in a closed environment at 1100 °C for 2 h'], 'characterization_techniques': ['Rietveld refinement', 'Elemental analysis', 'TEM', 'SAED', 'Dielectric impedance spectroscope']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
