Solid solutions of (1-x)Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3-xBa(Zr0.02Ti0.98)O3 (NBT- BZT) were prepared by conventional sintering method in the composition range of 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1. High purity (>99.9 %) chemical powders of Na2CO3 (SRL), Bi2O3 (SRL), TiO2 (Thermo-scientific), BaCO3 (Alfa Aesar), and ZrO2 (Sigma-Aldrich) were weighted stoichiometrically, and ball milled for 24 hours at 300 rpm with alumina balls using acetone as mixing media. The mixed powders were dried in an oven, followed by calcination at a temperature of 900\u2103 for 3 hrs. Disc-shaped pellets were prepared using \u223c13 mm diameter under a uniaxial pressure of 200 MPa. Sintering was carried out at 1150\u20131200\u2103for 2\u20134 hrs. The density of the sintered pellets was measured using the Archimedes principle and found to have a relative density of \u223c95 % of the theoretical density. For x-ray diffraction measurements, sintered pellets were grounded and annealed at 500 \xb0C for 1 hr to remove any strain, if any, produced while crushing it down. X-ray powder diffraction was performed on Empyrean, Malvern Panalytical (Netherland) using Cu K radiation having wavelength \u03bb= 1.54\xc5. Data were collected at a 2\u03b8 range of 15\u201390\xb0 in an interval of 0.02\xb0. For electrical property measurement, the samples were thinned to \u223c1 mm, electroded on both sides using silver paste and annealed at 500 \xb0C for 1 hr. Dielectric measurement was performed on NF-ZM2376 LCR meter in the temperature range 25\u2103\u2212600\u2103 at 100 Hz, 1 kHz, 10 kHz, 100 kHz, and 1 MHz. Electrical poling was done in a high DC power supply unit by applying a DC field of 4\u20135 kV/mm for 15\u201330 min in a silicone oil bath. The longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient (d 33 ) was measured on a YE2730A d33 meter. The ferroelectric and strain measurements were performed on Radiant Precision Premier II loop tracer with MTI strain measurement setup at 1 Hz frequency. Rietveld refinement was carried out using FULLPROF software.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
shows the x-ray powder diffraction pattern (1-x)NBT-xBZT for compositions in the range 0 \u2264x \u2264 1. shows the X-ray powder diffraction profiles of pseudocubic {110}c, {111}c, and {200}c reflections for composition in the range 0.00 \u2264x \u2264 0.50. Based on visual inspection analysis, for compositions in the range 0 \u2264x \u2264 0.10, the {111}C reflections appear doublet (second reflection pointed with an arrow), there is a broadening in the {110}C reflection and reflection {200}C is a singlet. For compositions in the range 0.11 \u2264x \u2264 0.20, the profiles of all reflections are singlet, with sharp reflections shown in (d-g). Each peak separates the Cu-K\u03b11 and K\u03b12 reflections (intensity ratio of K\u03b12/K\u03b11 = 0.5). For composition x = 0.50 and beyond, the profile of {111}C reflection is a singlet, and the {200}C is a doublet, indicating the presence of a single tetragonal phase (shown in (j)). For compositions 0.30 <x \u2264 0.40, the two-phase mixture of tetragonal and cubic phases becomes apparent, as shown with markers in (h, i). (a-j) shows the Rietveld fitted x-ray powder diffraction profiles of NBT-BZT for compositions 0 \u2264x \u2264 1. The PDF/ICSD collection code followed for specific structures are: Cc (166407) , R3c (01\u2013070\u20130741/154041) , Amm2 (77\u2013856/39607) , P4mm (00\u2013006\u20130452/1612]) and Pm3m (01\u2013074\u20134789/1609) ). Starting from x = 0.0 for pure NBT, following the literature of Rao et al. , the structural refinement was carried out using R3c, Cc, and Cc+R3c. The refinement using a single phase of R3c and Cc shows a misfit in {111}C and {211}C reflections (pointed with an arrow in (a, b). The refinement with the two-phase model of Cc+ R3c gave a good fit, accounting correctly for the peak positions and the profile shape, shown in (c). The same structural model continued till compositions x = 0.10, shown in (d). For compositions in the range 0.11 \u2264x \u2264 0.20 (shown for x = 0.12 and x = 0.20), refinement was carried out using cubic space group Pm3m, resulting in a good fit shown in (e, f). For composition 0.3 \u2264x \u2264 0.40 (shown for x = 0.30), considering the additional reflection apart from cubic, a two-phase model of P4mm + Pm3m was tried, and it gave a good fit. For composition x = 0.50 & 0.60, the same two-phase P4mm +Pm3m model was continued and found to be a good fit. For compositions in the range 0.70 \u2264x \u2264 1, two-phase models of P4mm + Pm3m & P4mm + Amm2 were tried, and the model P4mm +Amm2 gave a good fit. According to the literature , Ba(Ti0.98Zr0.02)O3 consists of a two-phase mixture of tetragonal (P4mm) and orthorhombic (Amm2) phases. (a-c) shows the plot of lattice parameters, unit cell volume, and phase fraction as a function of composition. It is due to the bigger ionic radii of \u201cBa\u201d (Shannon IR = 1.42 \xc5)and \u201cZr\u201d (IR = 0.72 \xc5) ions compared to the \u201cNa\u201d (IR = 1.18 \xc5), \u201cBi\u201d (IR = 1.17 \xc5) and \u201cTi\u201d (IR = 0.605 \xc5) at A and B- site. For compositions in the range 0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.10, the rhombohedral and monoclinic phase fractions in the two-phase region (R3c+ Cc phase) are nearly equal. It\u2019s a cubic single phase in the range 0.11 \u2264 x \u2264 0.20, and the concentration of the same cubic phase decreases as it enters the P4mm+ Pm3m two-phase regime in the composition range 0.30 \u2264 x \u2264 0.60, reaching a minimum of cubic fraction \u223c 20 % and tetragonal \u223c 80 % at x = 0.60. In the composition range of 0.70 \u2264 x \u2264 1.0, the phase fraction of the tetragonal phase (80 %) and orthorhombic (20 %) are nearly constant. shows the Raman scattering spectrum measured for composition x = (a) 0.06, (b) 0.12, (c) 0.15 and (d) 0.20 respectively. The Raman vibrational modes of NBT-based materials can be studied into three main regions: (1) below 200 cmE^{\u22121} corresponds to the vibrations of A-site, involving Na, Ba and Bi cations in NBT ceramics; (2) 200\u2013450 cmE^{\u22121} is assigned as the Ti-O vibrations; (3) above 450 cmE^{\u22121} associated with the vibrations of TiO6-octahedra. The broad Raman spectrum of NBT ceramics demonstrates the relaxor characteristics, which is very similar to the prototypical Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3 (PMN)-based materials. The peaks A, B, and C have been assigned to the Raman modes of A-site, Ti-O bond and TiO6 -octahedra, respectively. For our composition x = 0.06, four Raman modes have been noticed located at 138, 275, 518 and 594 cmE^{\u22121}, assigned as peak A, B 1 , C 1 , and C 2 , respectively, shown in (a), As the concentration of Ba increased, a few changes in the spectra were noticed, (1) mode close to 138 cm-1 weakens, and (2) a flat top has been developed near the mode 275 cmE^{\u22121}. For x = 0.12, 0.15 and 0.20, Ti-O peaks split into B 1 and B 2. The doublet splitting of Ti-O peaks (B 1 and B 2 ) indicates the tetragonal characteristic, for x = 0.12; apart from splitting in the B 1 and B 2 , an additional C 3 peak is noticeable. The triplet splitting of oxygen octahedral vibrational modes (C 1 , C 2 and C 3 ) reveals the rhombohedral local structure. The variation in Raman shifts for different compositions after deconvoluting the spectra with multiple Lorentzian functions is plotted in (e). shows the representative dielectric relative permittivity and loss factor tan(\u03b4) as a function of temperature measured for compositions x = 0.0, 0.08, 0.12, 0.20, 0.40, 0.70 and 1 respectively. Starting with x = 0.00 (NBT), two dielectric anomalies become apparent; the broad dielectric maxima peak (T 2 , T m ) corresponds to diffuse phase transition at 320 \xb0C, and the frequency-dependent dispersion (T 3 , T F-R, T d ) (considering \u223c100 kHz) near \u223c200 \xb0C corresponds to the origin of relaxor (T F-R ) and antiferroelectric to ferroelectric phase transition. This temperature is also known as the depoling temperature for NBT-based ceramics. The graph plot is shown in the temperature range of 30\u2013400 \xb0C to highlight the lower transitions; therefore, the first transition (T 1 ) is not visible. With increasing \u2018x\u2019, the dielectric anomaly (T 2 , or T m ) decreases linearly; however, the anomaly (T 3 , T F-R, T d ) drops abruptly to near room temperature (40\u201350\xb0C) for compositions in the range x = 0.10\u20130.20, and after that, it starts increasing and the both T2 and T3 merges to induce sharp phase transition temperature (T c ) for compositions x > 0.7, shown in the phase diagram of (h). It is interesting to see that the T d phase transition reaches room temperature, and it coincides with the MPB compositions (x = 0.10\u20130.20). (i) shows the plot of dielectric permittivity measured at room temperature vs. Interestingly, compared to other well-known systems, the current system (of composition x = 0.12) shows high dielectric permittivity along with high dielectric maxima temperature. In the automotive industries, there is demand for high-temperature (T > 150 \xb0C) stable multilayer capacitors (MLC) is needed for the specifications of X9R (temperature range of \u221255 to 200 \xb0C). These MLCs find applications in the electronic components of engine and antilock-braking systems. BaTiO3 ceramic is a well-known material used in multilayer capacitor (MLC) applications. The properties of BaTiO3 at room temperature are as follows: dielectric constant is \u223c 1700 at 1 kHz, T c \u223c 120 C with a piezoelectric coefficient of d33 \u223c190 pC/N. In our study, composition x = 0.12, shows the dielectric constant of \u223c 3200 (1 kHz), T m \u223c285 \xb0C with d 33 \u223c \u223c175 pC/N. We have highlighted the data in comparison with other NBT-based piezoceramic systems, which have been shown to have relatively high dielectric constants along with transition temperatures. In comparison to BaTiO3, the studied system has a similar piezoelectric response, however, the dielectric constant and transition temperature fall in the requirements of high-temperature applications X9R standard. Therefore, in comparison to BaTiO3, the studied system may be recommended for high-temperature applications. The comparison of the dielectric study between the NBT-BT (data taken from ) and NBT-BZT is shown in. (a) shows the plot of frequency dispersion of relative dielectric permittivity at room temperature for compositions x = 0.06, 0.08, 0.12, 0.15 and 0.20 of NBT- BZT and with BT = 0.06, 0.09, 0.12 of NBT-BT solid solutions respectively. The detailed relaxor study have been carried out by following the Curie \u2013 Weiss law and modified Curie \u2013 Weiss law. The plots fitting the reciprocal of \u03b5\u2019 as a function of temperature at a frequency of 100 kHz in. The linear relationship between 1/\u03b5\u2032 and temperature is not followed by the composition 0\u2264x\u22640.70. This is a clear indication of deviation from classical Curie \u2013 Weiss law. We have extrapolated this fitted line and obtained Curie \u2013 Weiss temperature T cw. T B refers to the temperature below which 1/ \u03b5\u2032 does not vary linearly with temperature. Modified Curie \u2013 Weiss law The dielectric behaviour of relaxor ferroelectric materials can be understood better with the help of the modified Curie \u2013 Weiss law. It is given by following equation:  Here \u03b5\u2032 is the real part of the dielectric constant at temperature T, \u03b5 m is the value of the dielectric constant at temperature T m , C is the Curie \u2013 Weiss constant and \u03b3 is a degree quantitative measure of the diffuseness of ferroelectric phase transition, and it lies between 1 and 2. Its value is 1 for normal ferroelectrics and 2 for ideal relaxor materials. The plot of ln (1/\u03b5\u2032 - 1/\u03b5 m ) vs ln(T-T m ) for different compositions at 100 kHz frequency is shown in. Thus, obtained data were linearly fitted, and we have obtained the value of \u03b3 and Curie \u2013 Weiss constant (C) as slope and intercept respectively. For all of the compositions value of \u03b3 obtained is much higher than \u20181\u2019 and closer to \u20182\u2019 except for x = 1, for which it is close to 1, suggesting that end member BaZr0.02Ti0.98O3 is a normal ferroelectric. The variation of \u2018\u03b3\u2019as a function of composition is shown in (i). For composition x = 0.12, the \u03b3 value found to be \u223c1.93, suggesting the composition is approaching the ideal relaxor. For NBT-6BT, the value of \u03b3 observed is \u223c1.7. (a-e) shows the composition dependence of piezoelectric, dielectric, and ferroelectric properties. The composition x = 0.12 shows relatively better properties compared to the adjacent compositions. The longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient (d 33 ) reaches a maximum of \u223c175 pC, The d* 33 \u223c700 pm/V, strain of 0.33 %, \u03b5 \u223c 3500 and P s \u223c 47 \xb5C/cmE^{2} respectively. Note that d 33 * is calculated using the formula \u223cS max /E max. The d 33 * value of \u223c700 pm/V at just \u223c65 kV/cm is higher than NBT- BT and NBT- BT- KNN solid solution. (a-o) shows the plots of polarization, bipolar and monopolar strain vs. electric field measured for compositions x = 0.0, 0.08, 0.12, 0.15 and 0.30. For composition x = 0.12, the shape of the PE loop is \u201cconstricted\u201d (double hysteresis) compared to the \u201csquare\u201d shape for other compositions. Similarly, the shape of the bipolar strain loop is \u201cSprout\u201d type for x = 0.12 compared to the \u201cButterfly\u201d of other compositions. It is important to note that the composition x = 0.12 shows the large piezoelectric strain (bipolar & monopolar) response of \u223c0.33 % compared to \u223c0.1 % of other compositions. The similar \u201cconstricted\u201d PE loop and \u201cSprout\u201d shape strain loop are observed for reported for NBT-BT near 100 \xb0C and for NBT-BT-KNN at room temperature. An electric field-dependent structural study was carried out to understand the influence of the electric field, chosen for compositions x = 0.12 and 0.30. they exhibit the anomalous crystal structure through XRD in. (a-e) shows the representative Rietveld fitted x-ray diffraction Bragg profiles of pseudocubic {110}C, {111}C and {200}C reflections of unpoled and poled samples of x = 0.12, and 030. The profiles of compositions x = 0.12, which appears as \u201ccubic like\u201d in the unpoled state, change immensely in the poled state. The Bragg profile of {200}C reflection changes from single reflection (002)C in cubic phase (Cu-K\u03b1 1 and K\u03b1 2 visible separately) to two reflections shown as (002)T and (200)T in (b-c). At the same time, there are no significant changes in the {111}C and {110}C reflections. According to Rohini et al. , for NBT- 6BT, the \u201ccubic-like\u201d structure of critical composition changes to tetragonal and rhombohedral phases with space groups P4mm & R3c after poling. The signature of the rhombohedral (R3c) phase is based on the presence of superlattice {311}pc reflection. However, in our study, composition x = 0.12 shows no superlattice reflection associated with {111}c reflection after poling. However, between the tetragonal ((200)T & (002)T) reflections, there is a signature of the second phase (rise in the intensity). The second phase has been incorporated with a two-phase model of P4mm + Pm3m and P4mm + R3m to account for the misfit. The P4mm+Pm3m shows a relatively lower \u03c7 E^{ } value (\u223c6.3) than the P4mm+R3m \u03c7 E^{ } (9.2). The same discrepancies were observed for NBT-BT. For composition x = 0.30, though it consists of a mixture of two phases, it does not show any changes in the Bragg profiles after poling ((e)). However, there is a significant systematic shift in the peaks towards the higher 2\u03b8 angle side (right), indicating a decrease in the unit cell volume. The refinement was carried out using a two-phase model of P4mm + Pm3m phases for both unpoled and poled states. shows the structural parameters of annealed and poled samples. In a ferroelectric piezoelectric system, including Pb(Zr, Ti)O3, Pb(Mg1/2Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3, (Na0.5Bi0.5)TiO3 -BaTiO3, the composition of enhanced piezoelectric, ferroelectric and dielectric properties has been correlated with the composition induced ferro- ferroelectric phase transition called morphotropic phase boundary (MPB). In our study, we have also observed an MPB at a composition of x = 0.12. However, in addition to MPB, for the same composition, the temperature-induced dielectric anomaly of ferroelectric- relaxor (T F-R, T d ) is preset near room temperature. I) composition-induced morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) and II) temperature-induced ferroelectric-relaxor dielectric anomaly (T F-R, T d ) near room temperature. So far, this kind of combined effect of two anomalies has not been observed in other NBT-based systems and appears to have a significant impact on the properties of the material. The factor responsible for reducing T d anomaly to near room temperature by the substituting of Ba(Ti0.98Zr0.02)O3 (BZT) instead of BaTiO3 may be associated with the crystallographic phases(s) at room temperature and the phase transition temperature(s) of the BaTiO3. In BaTiO3, there are three phase transition temperatures, rhombohedral to orthorhombic (T R-O ), orthorhombic to tetragonal (T O-T ) and tetragonal to cubic (T C ) which occur around \u221290 \xb0C, 0 \xb0C and 120 \xb0C respectively. According to the phase diagram of Zr-modified BaTiO3, the substitution of \u2018Zr\u2019 increases the T R-O, and T O-T temperatures and decreases T C temperature. For a composition of Ba(Ti0.98Zr0.02), the T R-O , T O-T phase transition temperatures are \u221260 C, 35 \xb0C and the T C is nearly the same \u223c120 \xb0C. So, at room temperature, Ba(Ti0.98Zr0.02) consists of mixed phases of tetragonal and orthorhombic phases. The systematic shift of the T R-O , T O-T transition temperatures in BZT may have shifted the T d of NBT to near room temperature. It is interesting to see that the compositions of the studied system show enhanced dielectric permittivity, even higher than NBT-BT, as shown in. Note that the slope magnitude and relaxor coefficient (\u03b3) are higher for critical compositions of NBT- BT and NBT-BZT, as shown in (b). The slopes for different compositions can be taken as a measure of the relative difference in the degree of dielectric dispersion, similar to \u2018\u03b3\u2019. In NBT- BT (data in (b)), Garg et al. observed the slope to be critically enhanced for composition BT = 0.6 %. The same has been correlated with the drastic change in the crystal structure and associated with rhombohedral/monoclinic to a \u201ccubic-like\u201d structure. In our study, from (b), in comparison to NBT-BT, compositions x > 0.08 have a higher magnitude of slope, which directly suggests that it has a higher concentration of interfaces or domain wall density. Quantitatively, the slope's magnitude is nearly double that of NBT-BT, which may hint at an increase in the number of interfaces or the domain wall density. Considering the T A-F , the transition region ensures the criticality associated with the coexistence of ferroelectric (R3c) and antiferroelectric (Pbnm) phases of variable domain characteristics of dynamic dispersion. In NBT-BT- KNN, Jo et al. demonstrated that the origin of superior piezoelectric response appears to be the ergodic relaxor nature and the reversible nonpolar phase that reverts to its unpoled state once the applied electric field is removed. On the contrary, Khautua et al. observed the field-induced phase transformation (long-modulated structure to R3c) above a critical field. In our study, based on the constricted shape of a strain loop for a critical composition x = 0.12 , which is characterised as an ergodic relaxor, based on our electric field-dependent structural study for the same composition shown in. It is found that there is an irreversible structural phase transformation from cubic (Pm3m) to cubic (Pm3m) + tetragonal (P4mm) phases. Similar field-induced structural transformation was found for NBT-BT solid solutions.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
shows the x-ray powder diffraction pattern (1-x)NBT-xBZT for compositions in the range 0 \u2264x \u2264 1. shows the X-ray powder diffraction profiles of pseudocubic {110}c, {111}c, and {200}c reflections for composition in the range 0.00 \u2264x \u2264 0.50. Based on visual inspection analysis, for compositions in the range 0 \u2264x \u2264 0.10, the {111}C reflections appear doublet (second reflection pointed with an arrow), there is a broadening in the {110}C reflection and reflection {200}C is a singlet. For compositions in the range 0.11 \u2264x \u2264 0.20, the profiles of all reflections are singlet, with sharp reflections shown in (d-g). Each peak separates the Cu-K\u03b11 and K\u03b12 reflections (intensity ratio of K\u03b12/K\u03b11 = 0.5). For composition x = 0.50 and beyond, the profile of {111}C reflection is a singlet, and the {200}C is a doublet, indicating the presence of a single tetragonal phase (shown in (j)). For compositions 0.30 <x \u2264 0.40, the two-phase mixture of tetragonal and cubic phases becomes apparent, as shown with markers in (h, i). (a-j) shows the Rietveld fitted x-ray powder diffraction profiles of NBT-BZT for compositions 0 \u2264x \u2264 1. The PDF/ICSD collection code followed for specific structures are: Cc (166407) , R3c (01\u2013070\u20130741/154041) , Amm2 (77\u2013856/39607) , P4mm (00\u2013006\u20130452/1612]) and Pm3m (01\u2013074\u20134789/1609) ). Starting from x = 0.0 for pure NBT, following the literature of Rao et al. , the structural refinement was carried out using R3c, Cc, and Cc+R3c. The refinement using a single phase of R3c and Cc shows a misfit in {111}C and {211}C reflections (pointed with an arrow in (a, b). The refinement with the two-phase model of Cc+ R3c gave a good fit, accounting correctly for the peak positions and the profile shape, shown in (c). The same structural model continued till compositions x = 0.10, shown in (d). For compositions in the range 0.11 \u2264x \u2264 0.20 (shown for x = 0.12 and x = 0.20), refinement was carried out using cubic space group Pm3m, resulting in a good fit shown in (e, f). For composition 0.3 \u2264x \u2264 0.40 (shown for x = 0.30), considering the additional reflection apart from cubic, a two-phase model of P4mm + Pm3m was tried, and it gave a good fit. For composition x = 0.50 & 0.60, the same two-phase P4mm +Pm3m model was continued and found to be a good fit. For compositions in the range 0.70 \u2264x \u2264 1, two-phase models of P4mm + Pm3m & P4mm + Amm2 were tried, and the model P4mm +Amm2 gave a good fit. According to the literature , Ba(Ti0.98Zr0.02)O3 consists of a two-phase mixture of tetragonal (P4mm) and orthorhombic (Amm2) phases. (a-c) shows the plot of lattice parameters, unit cell volume, and phase fraction as a function of composition. It is due to the bigger ionic radii of \u201cBa\u201d (Shannon IR = 1.42 \xc5)and \u201cZr\u201d (IR = 0.72 \xc5) ions compared to the \u201cNa\u201d (IR = 1.18 \xc5), \u201cBi\u201d (IR = 1.17 \xc5) and \u201cTi\u201d (IR = 0.605 \xc5) at A and B- site. For compositions in the range 0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.10, the rhombohedral and monoclinic phase fractions in the two-phase region (R3c+ Cc phase) are nearly equal. It\u2019s a cubic single phase in the range 0.11 \u2264 x \u2264 0.20, and the concentration of the same cubic phase decreases as it enters the P4mm+ Pm3m two-phase regime in the composition range 0.30 \u2264 x \u2264 0.60, reaching a minimum of cubic fraction \u223c 20 % and tetragonal \u223c 80 % at x = 0.60. In the composition range of 0.70 \u2264 x \u2264 1.0, the phase fraction of the tetragonal phase (80 %) and orthorhombic (20 %) are nearly constant. shows the Raman scattering spectrum measured for composition x = (a) 0.06, (b) 0.12, (c) 0.15 and (d) 0.20 respectively. The Raman vibrational modes of NBT-based materials can be studied into three main regions: (1) below 200 cmE^{\u22121} corresponds to the vibrations of A-site, involving Na, Ba and Bi cations in NBT ceramics; (2) 200\u2013450 cmE^{\u22121} is assigned as the Ti-O vibrations; (3) above 450 cmE^{\u22121} associated with the vibrations of TiO6-octahedra. The broad Raman spectrum of NBT ceramics demonstrates the relaxor characteristics, which is very similar to the prototypical Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3 (PMN)-based materials. The peaks A, B, and C have been assigned to the Raman modes of A-site, Ti-O bond and TiO6 -octahedra, respectively. For our composition x = 0.06, four Raman modes have been noticed located at 138, 275, 518 and 594 cmE^{\u22121}, assigned as peak A, B 1 , C 1 , and C 2 , respectively, shown in (a), As the concentration of Ba increased, a few changes in the spectra were noticed, (1) mode close to 138 cm-1 weakens, and (2) a flat top has been developed near the mode 275 cmE^{\u22121}. For x = 0.12, 0.15 and 0.20, Ti-O peaks split into B 1 and B 2. The doublet splitting of Ti-O peaks (B 1 and B 2 ) indicates the tetragonal characteristic, for x = 0.12; apart from splitting in the B 1 and B 2 , an additional C 3 peak is noticeable. The triplet splitting of oxygen octahedral vibrational modes (C 1 , C 2 and C 3 ) reveals the rhombohedral local structure. The variation in Raman shifts for different compositions after deconvoluting the spectra with multiple Lorentzian functions is plotted in (e). shows the representative dielectric relative permittivity and loss factor tan(\u03b4) as a function of temperature measured for compositions x = 0.0, 0.08, 0.12, 0.20, 0.40, 0.70 and 1 respectively. Starting with x = 0.00 (NBT), two dielectric anomalies become apparent; the broad dielectric maxima peak (T 2 , T m ) corresponds to diffuse phase transition at 320 \xb0C, and the frequency-dependent dispersion (T 3 , T F-R, T d ) (considering \u223c100 kHz) near \u223c200 \xb0C corresponds to the origin of relaxor (T F-R ) and antiferroelectric to ferroelectric phase transition. This temperature is also known as the depoling temperature for NBT-based ceramics. The graph plot is shown in the temperature range of 30\u2013400 \xb0C to highlight the lower transitions; therefore, the first transition (T 1 ) is not visible. With increasing \u2018x\u2019, the dielectric anomaly (T 2 , or T m ) decreases linearly; however, the anomaly (T 3 , T F-R, T d ) drops abruptly to near room temperature (40\u201350\xb0C) for compositions in the range x = 0.10\u20130.20, and after that, it starts increasing and the both T2 and T3 merges to induce sharp phase transition temperature (T c ) for compositions x > 0.7, shown in the phase diagram of (h). It is interesting to see that the T d phase transition reaches room temperature, and it coincides with the MPB compositions (x = 0.10\u20130.20). (i) shows the plot of dielectric permittivity measured at room temperature vs. Interestingly, compared to other well-known systems, the current system (of composition x = 0.12) shows high dielectric permittivity along with high dielectric maxima temperature. In the automotive industries, there is demand for high-temperature (T > 150 \xb0C) stable multilayer capacitors (MLC) is needed for the specifications of X9R (temperature range of \u221255 to 200 \xb0C). These MLCs find applications in the electronic components of engine and antilock-braking systems. BaTiO3 ceramic is a well-known material used in multilayer capacitor (MLC) applications. The properties of BaTiO3 at room temperature are as follows: dielectric constant is \u223c 1700 at 1 kHz, T c \u223c 120 C with a piezoelectric coefficient of d33 \u223c190 pC/N. In our study, composition x = 0.12, shows the dielectric constant of \u223c 3200 (1 kHz), T m \u223c285 \xb0C with d 33 \u223c \u223c175 pC/N. We have highlighted the data in comparison with other NBT-based piezoceramic systems, which have been shown to have relatively high dielectric constants along with transition temperatures. In comparison to BaTiO3, the studied system has a similar piezoelectric response, however, the dielectric constant and transition temperature fall in the requirements of high-temperature applications X9R standard. Therefore, in comparison to BaTiO3, the studied system may be recommended for high-temperature applications. The comparison of the dielectric study between the NBT-BT (data taken from ) and NBT-BZT is shown in. (a) shows the plot of frequency dispersion of relative dielectric permittivity at room temperature for compositions x = 0.06, 0.08, 0.12, 0.15 and 0.20 of NBT- BZT and with BT = 0.06, 0.09, 0.12 of NBT-BT solid solutions respectively. The detailed relaxor study have been carried out by following the Curie \u2013 Weiss law and modified Curie \u2013 Weiss law. The plots fitting the reciprocal of \u03b5\u2019 as a function of temperature at a frequency of 100 kHz in. The linear relationship between 1/\u03b5\u2032 and temperature is not followed by the composition 0\u2264x\u22640.70. This is a clear indication of deviation from classical Curie \u2013 Weiss law. We have extrapolated this fitted line and obtained Curie \u2013 Weiss temperature T cw. T B refers to the temperature below which 1/ \u03b5\u2032 does not vary linearly with temperature. Modified Curie \u2013 Weiss law The dielectric behaviour of relaxor ferroelectric materials can be understood better with the help of the modified Curie \u2013 Weiss law. It is given by following equation:  Here \u03b5\u2032 is the real part of the dielectric constant at temperature T, \u03b5 m is the value of the dielectric constant at temperature T m , C is the Curie \u2013 Weiss constant and \u03b3 is a degree quantitative measure of the diffuseness of ferroelectric phase transition, and it lies between 1 and 2. Its value is 1 for normal ferroelectrics and 2 for ideal relaxor materials. The plot of ln (1/\u03b5\u2032 - 1/\u03b5 m ) vs ln(T-T m ) for different compositions at 100 kHz frequency is shown in. Thus, obtained data were linearly fitted, and we have obtained the value of \u03b3 and Curie \u2013 Weiss constant (C) as slope and intercept respectively. For all of the compositions value of \u03b3 obtained is much higher than \u20181\u2019 and closer to \u20182\u2019 except for x = 1, for which it is close to 1, suggesting that end member BaZr0.02Ti0.98O3 is a normal ferroelectric. The variation of \u2018\u03b3\u2019as a function of composition is shown in (i). For composition x = 0.12, the \u03b3 value found to be \u223c1.93, suggesting the composition is approaching the ideal relaxor. For NBT-6BT, the value of \u03b3 observed is \u223c1.7. (a-e) shows the composition dependence of piezoelectric, dielectric, and ferroelectric properties. The composition x = 0.12 shows relatively better properties compared to the adjacent compositions. The longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient (d 33 ) reaches a maximum of \u223c175 pC, The d* 33 \u223c700 pm/V, strain of 0.33 %, \u03b5 \u223c 3500 and P s \u223c 47 \xb5C/cmE^{2} respectively. Note that d 33 * is calculated using the formula \u223cS max /E max. The d 33 * value of \u223c700 pm/V at just \u223c65 kV/cm is higher than NBT- BT and NBT- BT- KNN solid solution. (a-o) shows the plots of polarization, bipolar and monopolar strain vs. electric field measured for compositions x = 0.0, 0.08, 0.12, 0.15 and 0.30. For composition x = 0.12, the shape of the PE loop is \u201cconstricted\u201d (double hysteresis) compared to the \u201csquare\u201d shape for other compositions. Similarly, the shape of the bipolar strain loop is \u201cSprout\u201d type for x = 0.12 compared to the \u201cButterfly\u201d of other compositions. It is important to note that the composition x = 0.12 shows the large piezoelectric strain (bipolar & monopolar) response of \u223c0.33 % compared to \u223c0.1 % of other compositions. The similar \u201cconstricted\u201d PE loop and \u201cSprout\u201d shape strain loop are observed for reported for NBT-BT near 100 \xb0C and for NBT-BT-KNN at room temperature. An electric field-dependent structural study was carried out to understand the influence of the electric field, chosen for compositions x = 0.12 and 0.30. they exhibit the anomalous crystal structure through XRD in. (a-e) shows the representative Rietveld fitted x-ray diffraction Bragg profiles of pseudocubic {110}C, {111}C and {200}C reflections of unpoled and poled samples of x = 0.12, and 030. The profiles of compositions x = 0.12, which appears as \u201ccubic like\u201d in the unpoled state, change immensely in the poled state. The Bragg profile of {200}C reflection changes from single reflection (002)C in cubic phase (Cu-K\u03b1 1 and K\u03b1 2 visible separately) to two reflections shown as (002)T and (200)T in (b-c). At the same time, there are no significant changes in the {111}C and {110}C reflections. According to Rohini et al. , for NBT- 6BT, the \u201ccubic-like\u201d structure of critical composition changes to tetragonal and rhombohedral phases with space groups P4mm & R3c after poling. The signature of the rhombohedral (R3c) phase is based on the presence of superlattice {311}pc reflection. However, in our study, composition x = 0.12 shows no superlattice reflection associated with {111}c reflection after poling. However, between the tetragonal ((200)T & (002)T) reflections, there is a signature of the second phase (rise in the intensity). The second phase has been incorporated with a two-phase model of P4mm + Pm3m and P4mm + R3m to account for the misfit. The P4mm+Pm3m shows a relatively lower \u03c7 E^{ } value (\u223c6.3) than the P4mm+R3m \u03c7 E^{ } (9.2). The same discrepancies were observed for NBT-BT. For composition x = 0.30, though it consists of a mixture of two phases, it does not show any changes in the Bragg profiles after poling ((e)). However, there is a significant systematic shift in the peaks towards the higher 2\u03b8 angle side (right), indicating a decrease in the unit cell volume. The refinement was carried out using a two-phase model of P4mm + Pm3m phases for both unpoled and poled states. shows the structural parameters of annealed and poled samples. In a ferroelectric piezoelectric system, including Pb(Zr, Ti)O3, Pb(Mg1/2Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3, (Na0.5Bi0.5)TiO3 -BaTiO3, the composition of enhanced piezoelectric, ferroelectric and dielectric properties has been correlated with the composition induced ferro- ferroelectric phase transition called morphotropic phase boundary (MPB). In our study, we have also observed an MPB at a composition of x = 0.12. However, in addition to MPB, for the same composition, the temperature-induced dielectric anomaly of ferroelectric- relaxor (T F-R, T d ) is preset near room temperature. I) composition-induced morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) and II) temperature-induced ferroelectric-relaxor dielectric anomaly (T F-R, T d ) near room temperature. So far, this kind of combined effect of two anomalies has not been observed in other NBT-based systems and appears to have a significant impact on the properties of the material. The factor responsible for reducing T d anomaly to near room temperature by the substituting of Ba(Ti0.98Zr0.02)O3 (BZT) instead of BaTiO3 may be associated with the crystallographic phases(s) at room temperature and the phase transition temperature(s) of the BaTiO3. In BaTiO3, there are three phase transition temperatures, rhombohedral to orthorhombic (T R-O ), orthorhombic to tetragonal (T O-T ) and tetragonal to cubic (T C ) which occur around \u221290 \xb0C, 0 \xb0C and 120 \xb0C respectively. According to the phase diagram of Zr-modified BaTiO3, the substitution of \u2018Zr\u2019 increases the T R-O, and T O-T temperatures and decreases T C temperature. For a composition of Ba(Ti0.98Zr0.02), the T R-O , T O-T phase transition temperatures are \u221260 C, 35 \xb0C and the T C is nearly the same \u223c120 \xb0C. So, at room temperature, Ba(Ti0.98Zr0.02) consists of mixed phases of tetragonal and orthorhombic phases. The systematic shift of the T R-O , T O-T transition temperatures in BZT may have shifted the T d of NBT to near room temperature. It is interesting to see that the compositions of the studied system show enhanced dielectric permittivity, even higher than NBT-BT, as shown in. Note that the slope magnitude and relaxor coefficient (\u03b3) are higher for critical compositions of NBT- BT and NBT-BZT, as shown in (b). The slopes for different compositions can be taken as a measure of the relative difference in the degree of dielectric dispersion, similar to \u2018\u03b3\u2019. In NBT- BT (data in (b)), Garg et al. observed the slope to be critically enhanced for composition BT = 0.6 %. The same has been correlated with the drastic change in the crystal structure and associated with rhombohedral/monoclinic to a \u201ccubic-like\u201d structure. In our study, from (b), in comparison to NBT-BT, compositions x > 0.08 have a higher magnitude of slope, which directly suggests that it has a higher concentration of interfaces or domain wall density. Quantitatively, the slope's magnitude is nearly double that of NBT-BT, which may hint at an increase in the number of interfaces or the domain wall density. Considering the T A-F , the transition region ensures the criticality associated with the coexistence of ferroelectric (R3c) and antiferroelectric (Pbnm) phases of variable domain characteristics of dynamic dispersion. In NBT-BT- KNN, Jo et al. demonstrated that the origin of superior piezoelectric response appears to be the ergodic relaxor nature and the reversible nonpolar phase that reverts to its unpoled state once the applied electric field is removed. On the contrary, Khautua et al. observed the field-induced phase transformation (long-modulated structure to R3c) above a critical field. In our study, based on the constricted shape of a strain loop for a critical composition x = 0.12 , which is characterised as an ergodic relaxor, based on our electric field-dependent structural study for the same composition shown in. It is found that there is an irreversible structural phase transformation from cubic (Pm3m) to cubic (Pm3m) + tetragonal (P4mm) phases. Similar field-induced structural transformation was found for NBT-BT solid solutions.
