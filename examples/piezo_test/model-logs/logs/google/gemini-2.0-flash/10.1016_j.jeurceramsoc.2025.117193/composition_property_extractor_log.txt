# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
exhibits the bulk and relative densities of the PKxNT ceramics sintered at different temperatures from 1190 \xb0C to 1250 \xb0C. It is observed that the maximum densities, both the bulk and the relative values, are obtained at 1230 \xb0C, from which the optimal sintering temperatures for each composition are determined. The following microstructure, dielectric, and piezoelectric analysis are based on the samples sintered at this temperature. (a) shows the XRD patterns of the PKxNT ceramics. According to the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) files (Nos.70-1388 and 33-1020), two orthorhombic ferroelectric phases (PbNb2O6/space group Cm2m and KPb2Nb5O15/space group C222) were detected in all the samples. The ferroelectricity of the pure PbNb2O6 is usually achieved via a quenching process after heating. It is reported that the introduction of KE^{+} can avoid the formation of the stable rhombohedral non-ferroelectric polymorph and stabilize the ferroelectric phase, in a natural cooling process. It is observed that the crystal structures of the orthorhombic PN and KPN phases belong to TTB with slight difference at A-site. KPN can be regarded as a new compound formed by the substitution of KE^{+} for PbE^{2+}. The standard powder diffraction peaks for the PN and the KPN are quite similar, except that the 2\u03b8 values of the diffraction peaks for the KPN phase are slightly lower than those of the PN phase. (b) exhibits the enlarged diffraction peaks within the 2\u03b8 range of 27\u201330\xb0. It is observed that the main diffraction peak of (1 3 1) shifts towards lower angles, from 27.908\xb0(PN) to 27.681\xb0(KPN) with x from 0.05 to 0.20, indicating that the lattice parameters of the PKxNT ceramics increase. It is reported that the radius of KE^{+} (12 coordination, r = 1.78 \xc5) is larger than that of PbE^{2+} (r = 1.63 \xc5). The entrance of KE^{+} into the empty A-site would result in an increased cell volume, from 1224.0 \xc5E^{3} (PN) to 1252.1 \xc5E^{3} (KPN), which is in accordance with the increased lattice volume with x from 0.05 to 0.20, as listed. In addition, the intensity of partial diffraction peaks for the KPN phase differs from that of the PN phase. For example, the peak intensity of (0 2 1) in KPN is higher than that in PN. As (c) shows, the diffraction peak of (0 2 1) gradually increases with x, indicating that the PN phase gradually evolves into the KPN phase. Based on the experimental facts, we suggested that the introduction of KE^{+} into the PN-based matrix would result in an increase of the KPN phase. (a\u2013d) shows the SEM and EDS results of the PKxNT ceramics. It is observed from (a,b) that the PK0.05NT and PK0.10NT ceramics are fully densified with no pores detected. Fine cracks, as observed in (a), are common in PN-based ceramics, which are attributed to the excessive internal stress caused by abnormal grain growth during the sintering process. It is noticed that the fine cracks gradually disappear with x increasing, indicating that the introduction of KE^{+} could relieve the internal stress during the sintering process and reduce the fine cracks in consequence. In (d), the grain morphology of the PK0.20NT ceramic exhibits a distinct elongated columnar shape, which is not reported in the PN-based ceramics but is generally observed in other tungsten-bronze structured (TB) systems. As reported, the introduction of KE^{+} could reduce the surface energy of the crystal plane (0 0 1), leading to a faster grain growth rate along this direction. Therefore, the anisotropic grains are more likely related with the KPN fraction. The pores observed in (c-d) are suggested to correlate with the grain transformation from equiaxed to columnar, which contribute to the reduced densities at x = 0.15 and 0.20. lists the bulk and relative densities of the PKxNT ceramics sintered at 1230 \xb0C. To obtain the lattice volume of different samples, the diffraction peaks were fitted by the GSAS \u2161 software using the least-square approach. It is observed that the relative densities of the PK0.05NT and PK0.10NT ceramics stay above 93 %, which are higher than those of the PK0.15NT and PK0.20NT ceramics. The appearance of columnar grains indicates that the oriented grain growth happens in the PKxNT ceramics, which can be attributed to the grain growth habit of the tungsten-bronze structured systems and/or the mechanism of partial melting. It is also observed from the EDS results that the atomic proportion of K element increases with x, which also demonstrates the gradual increasing content of the KPN phase within the PKxNT matrix. It is suggested that the improved sintering behavior and the increased diffuse phase transition (DPT) via KE^{+}/TaE^{5+} co-substitution contributed to the enhanced piezoelectric performance, both in d 33 and Q m values. The DPT behavior will be discussed in. (a) plots the P-E hysteresis loops of the PKxNT ceramics, tested at 1 Hz and room temperature (RT). All P-E loops behave similarly to those of the orthorhombic PN-based ceramics with lossy characteristics. To clarify this phenomenon, d 33 values for different samples at various poling voltages and temperatures are present in (b,c). In (b), the d 33 values increase with the poling voltage initially and become saturated beyond 3 kV/mm gradually, indicating that all samples can be fully polarized at 4 kV/mm. The d 33 values poled at 3 kV/mm reach more than 95 % of the values obtained at 4 kV/mm. (c) presents the d 33 variations with the poling temperature, polarized at 4 kV/mm for 30 minutes. Obviously, the poling temperature has a significant effect on the polarization for the PN-based ceramics. The d 33 values for PK0.15NT and PK0.2NT poled at 150 \xb0C are even 50 % higher than those polarized at 100 \xb0C. The breakdown strengths of the PKxNT ceramics are around 4.5 kV/mm. Therefore, further increasing the poling voltage is not conducive for higher d 33 values. (a) shows the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the PKxNT ceramics, from which the valence states of major elements are studied. The high-resolution XPS profiles of Pb 4f and Nb 3d are fitted by the Gaussian-Lorenz function, as present in (b,c). It is observed that Pb and Nb co-exist well in all PKxNT ceramics with the valence states of + 2 and + 5, respectively. With the introduction of KE^{+} into the A-site vacancies with partially filling, the electron densities around the atoms at A- and B- sites increase, leading to the lowered orbital electron energies of Pb 4f and Nb 3d. Such procedure is confirmed from the peak shifts of Pb 4f and Nb 3d towards lower binding energies, as shown in (b,c). Raman spectra are effective in analyzing the evolution of the lattice structure. (a) exhibits the Raman spectra of the PKxNT ceramics within the waveband range of 50\u20131000 cmE^{\u22121}. As reported in other TTB-niobate compounds, three characteristic Raman peaks are related to the internal vibration modes of the [NbO6] octahedron, which are identified as O-Nb-O bending mode(\u03bd5 @\u223c250 cmE^{\u22121}), O-Nb-O stretching mode(\u03bd2 @\u223c635 cmE^{\u22121}), and Nb-O stretching mode(\u03bd1 @\u223c836 cmE^{\u22121}), respectively. No significant variations are observed from the internal vibration modes (\u03bd5, \u03bd2, and \u03bd1) at different x, indicating that all KE^{+} ions enter into A-sites and NbE^{5+}/TaE^{5+} ions retain identical distribution on B-sites, thus the internal vibration modes are not affected by KE^{+}. The Raman peaks located below 200 cmE^{\u22121} correspond to the external vibration modes, which are attributed to the motion of the cations at A-sites with respect to the oxygen octahedral framework of [NbO6]. It is conducive to reveal the evolution of the lattice structure from \u201cunfilled\u201d-TTB to \u201cfilled\u201d-TTB via analysing the Raman peaks below 200 cmE^{\u22121}. (b) shows the Raman spectra of the PKxNT ceramics within the waveband range of 50\u2013210 cmE^{\u22121}. Four vibration modes at 70 cmE^{\u22121}, 82 cmE^{\u22121}, 145 cmE^{\u22121}, and 206 cmE^{\u22121} are detected for the sample of x = 0.05. The Raman peak at 70 cmE^{\u22121} is reported to attribute to a constant occupancy of PbE^{2+} ions at A-sites. With x increasing, it is observed that the Raman peak around 82 cmE^{\u22121} disappears and the two peaks around 145 cmE^{\u22121} and 206 cmE^{\u22121} merge into a broad one gradually. The merged Raman peak is considered to relate with the disordered structure derived from the full occupancy of empty A-sites by KE^{+}. As was known, PbE^{2+} cations prefer to occupy the pentagonal A2 sites in PN. According to Olsen\u2019s structure refinement, two configurations dominate the vacancies at the square A1 sites, which reduce the sublattice disorder of A-sites. In KPN, the A-site disorder of the \u201cfilled\u201d TTB structure could be improved via the substitution of KE^{+} for PbE^{2+}, though KE^{+} preferentially occupies A2. Based on Sciau\u2019s neutron diffraction refinement results, the Pb/K distribution ratios are is 90/10 % at A1 and 55/45 % at A2, respectively. The PbE^{2+} cations in KPN, occupying two disordered positions at A2, deviate from the (2 mm) symmetry and increase the A-site sublattice disorder consequentially. (a\u2013d) exhibit the temperature dependence of the dielectric properties (\u03b5 r and tan\u03b4) of the PKxNT ceramics. It is noticed from (a) that two separated phase transition peaks are observed, as marked with Peak-A around 470 \xb0C belonging to KPN ceramics while Peak-B around 560 \xb0C from PN ceramics. It is noticed that the Peak-A is barely visible from \u03b5 r curves but clearly observed from tan\u03b4. The complete merged Peaks-A and -B are obtained at x = 0.20, accompanied by the disappearance of the loss peaks, as (d) shows. It is also observed from (a\u2013c) that another Peaks-C around 300 \xb0C present the characteristics of Frequency Dispersion, which have been reported by Zhao and Jin et al.. It is also noticed from (d) that the Peak-C gradually weakens with x and disappears at x = 0.20, indicating that the incorporation of KE^{+} could reduce the defect dipoles of the PN-based ceramics. (e) shows the temperature dependence of the dielectric constants (\u03b5 r) of the PKxNT ceramics at 1 MHz, from which the T C shifts towards lower temperatures with x increasing. Corresponding T C values of the PKxNT ceramics are exhibited in (f). It is notable that the T C value is decreased linearly with x, yielding to an intercept of 593 \xb1 1 \xb0C, as (f) shows. It is also noticed that the peak-width of the phase transition increases with x, behaving an enhanced diffuse phase transition (DPT) characteristic. Sahini et al. reported a relaxor behavior in K-substituted solid solutions of PbNb2O6. In our study, only DPT behaviors are observed in K/Ta co-substituted PbNb2O6 matrix. Further studies are requested at higher x values to elucidate the DPT and/or relaxor phenomena. For better understanding the phase transition of the PKxNT ceramics, it is noticed from that all specimens exhibit diffuse phase transition (DPT) behaviors on ferroelectric phase transition. is the modified formula of Curie-Weiss law proposed by Uchino et al. , which is often adopted to evaluate the character of the ferroelectric transition, namely whether diffuse or not, and the possible presence of high-temperature relaxor states via fitting the temperature dependent permittivity curves. Here \u03b5 m is the maximum dielectric permittivity; T m is its related temperature; \u03b3 indicates the character of the phase transition; C \u2032\u2032 is the Curie-like constant. To obtain the \u03b3 values of samples, was logarithmically transformed. Logarithmic deformation of is as follow:  (e\u2013h) exhibit the linear fitting results of the modified Curie-Weiss law on the plots of ln \u03b5 \u2032\u2212 \u03b5 m \u2032E^{1}E^{1} as a function of ln T\u2212 T m at 1 MHz, where the black dots represent the experimental data while the red solid-lines are the least-squared linear fitting results. The slope obtained from the linear fitting corresponds to the \u03b3 value of each sample. The fitted \u03b3 values are 1.43, 1.48, 1.55, and 1.58, corresponding to the samples of x = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20, respectively. It is reported that \u03b3= 1 represents a \u201cnormal\u201d ferroelectric phase transition and a relaxor behavior is obtained at \u03b3= 2; while 1 < \u03b3< 2 corresponds to a DPT related to the chemical inhomogeneity and associated distribution of transition temperatures. In this study, the \u03b3 values for all samples are within 1\u20132, confirming the diffuse character of the phase transition. Additionally, the \u03b3 value gradually increases with x, indicating that the DPT level increases. Considering the DPT behavior is usually related to the chemical inhomogeneity and defects, the introduction of KE^{+} could increase the disorder state at A-sites filled by PbE^{2+}/and KE^{+}, matching well with the Raman analysis. exhibit the variation of the d 33 values as a function of the annealing temperatures for the untreated(a) and heat-treated(b) PKxNT ceramics, measured at RT after annealing for 30 min. The first depolarization stage, along with softly declined d 33 values, occurs within the annealing temperature range of 100\u2013250 \xb0C for the samples of x = 0.05\u20130.15. Then the d 33 values remain stable at 250\u2013450 \xb0C. The second depolarization occurs near the T C region for each sample, followed by a dramatic decrease in d 33. The first depolarization and the stabilized d 33 values are attributed to the motion and stabilization processes of the domain walls. It is noticed that the d 33 values for the sample of x = 0.20 keep declining with the annealing temperature rising till 400 \xb0C, but still stay above 100 pC/N. To further verify the thermal stability of the piezoelectric performance, all annealed samples were heat-treated again at 350 \xb0C for 2 h and the d 33 values were measured at RT. It is observed from (b) that the first depolarization process is eliminated after the heat treatment and all samples exhibit excellent piezoelectric thermal stability below 400 \xb0C.

                     [Nb0.96Ta0.04]2O6 (PKxNT, xâ¯=â¯0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20) ceramics were prepared via the solid-state reaction method. It was discovered that the A-site vacancies filled by K+ induced the conversion of the tetragonal tungsten bronze (TTB) structure from âunfilledâ to âfilledâ. Two kinds of orthorhombic ferroelectric phases were indexed from the XRD profiles. The grain morphology was transformed from equiaxed to columnar and the diffuse phase transition (DPT) behavior was observed. Improved piezoelectric performance (d
                     33 = 141 pC/N) and reduced dielectric loss (tanÎ´ = 0.009) were obtained in the sample of PbK0.20NT. It is suggested that the strategy of K+/Ta5+ co-substitution could greatly improve the piezoelectric properties of the PbNb2O6-based ceramic, which is promising for expanding its application scenarios.

# INTRODUCTION
Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT)-based ceramics have been dominant for a long time due to their excellent piezoelectric properties and affordable prices. However, the lower T C for the PZT-based ceramics limits their applications for using above 300 \xb0C. Bismuth layer-structured ferroelectrics (BLSFs) are considered as one of the solutions for high-temperature applications due to their higher T C, such as CaBi2Nb2O9 (T C\u223c940 \xb0C) and Bi3TiNbO9 (T C\u223c900 \xb0C). However, the lower piezoelectric constant values (d 33<20 pC/N) of the BLSFs limit their practical applications. PbNb2O6 (PN) based ceramics with tetragonal tungsten bronze (TTB) crystal structure, possessing higher T C (570 \xb0C) and d 33 (\u223c70 pC/N) values, are expected to be applied at 300\u2013450 \xb0C. The diverse piezoelectric and dielectric properties of the PN-based ceramics are ascribed to the unique TTB structure with general formula of (A1)2(A2)4(C)4(B1)2(B2)8O30. Such frameworks are constituted of corner-shared [BO6] octahedrons. It is reported that its B sites are often occupied by NbE^{5+}, TaE^{5+}, TiE^{4+} with A-sites occupied by larger ions such as PbE^{2+}, BaE^{2+}, SrE^{2+}, KE^{+}, etc. As was known for the PN-based ceramics, 5 of the 6 A-sites are occupied by PbE^{2+}. In other words, A-sites are not completely filled, which are so called \u201cunfilled\u201d TTB. In addition, a \u201cfilled\u201d TTB is obtained in KPb2Nb5O15 (KPN), indicating completely filled A-sites. Due to its flexibility in lattice tolerance, diverse piezoelectric and dielectric properties of the PN-based ceramics are expected. Ion substitution is effective for improving the sintering behavior and piezoelectric properties of the PN-based ceramics. The addition of TiE^{4+} not only contributed to the densification, but also increased its Curie temperature. Chen obtained promising piezoelectric performance (d 33 = 92 pC/N and T C = 513 \xb0C) in Ba/Ti co-doped PN ceramics. In Ca/Mn co-doped PN-based ceramics, Cai et al. found that the A/B-site co-doping was effective to obtain stable piezoelectric and dielectric performance. Yuan et al. reported a densified Pb0.95Ba0.05Nb2O6 piezoelectric ceramic with WE^{6+} modification, which improved the d 33 value to 108 pC/N and reduced the dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) to 0.006. Jin obtained excellent piezoelectric performance (d 33 = 90 pC/N, tan\u03b4 = 0.005) in Ba/Ti co-doped PN-based ceramics with x mol% of MnO2. Considering the importance of A-site occupied condition to the performance of the TTB structured PN-based ceramics, we investigated the evolution process from the \u201cunfilled\u201d TTB-PN to the \u201cfilled\u201d TTB-KPN via substituting PbE^{2+} with KE^{+}. To maintain electrical neutrality, two KE^{+} cations are introduced to substitute one PbE^{2+}. Therefore, all A-sites in each unit cell are expected to be fully filled by KE^{+} ions.

# CONCLUSION
In this study, dense Pb(1-x)K2x [Nb0.96Ta0.04]2O6 (PKxNT, x = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20) were prepared via the conventional solid-state reaction method. XRD analysis revealed that the crystalline structure was transformed from the \u201cunfilled\u201d TTB (PN-based) to the \u201cfilled\u201d TTB (KPN-based) via the introduction of KE^{+}. SEM results exhibited that the grain morphology was evolved from equiaxed to columnar. Diffuse phase transition (DPT) behavior was also studied. All samples exhibit good thermal stability below 400 \xb0C after heat-treated at 350 \xb0C for 2 h. In general, the sample of PK0.20NT presents excellent properties: d 33 = 141 pC/N, tan\u03b4 = 0.009, k p = 0.31, Q m = 175, and T C = 481 \xb0C. The experimental results indicate that the modification strategy on A-site from \u201cunfilled\u201d to \u201cfilled\u201d is feasible for the PN-based piezoelectric ceramics with greatly improved piezoelectric performance.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
exhibits the bulk and relative densities of the PKxNT ceramics sintered at different temperatures from 1190 \xb0C to 1250 \xb0C. It is observed that the maximum densities, both the bulk and the relative values, are obtained at 1230 \xb0C, from which the optimal sintering temperatures for each composition are determined. The following microstructure, dielectric, and piezoelectric analysis are based on the samples sintered at this temperature. (a) shows the XRD patterns of the PKxNT ceramics. According to the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) files (Nos.70-1388 and 33-1020), two orthorhombic ferroelectric phases (PbNb2O6/space group Cm2m and KPb2Nb5O15/space group C222) were detected in all the samples. The ferroelectricity of the pure PbNb2O6 is usually achieved via a quenching process after heating. It is reported that the introduction of KE^{+} can avoid the formation of the stable rhombohedral non-ferroelectric polymorph and stabilize the ferroelectric phase, in a natural cooling process. It is observed that the crystal structures of the orthorhombic PN and KPN phases belong to TTB with slight difference at A-site. KPN can be regarded as a new compound formed by the substitution of KE^{+} for PbE^{2+}. The standard powder diffraction peaks for the PN and the KPN are quite similar, except that the 2\u03b8 values of the diffraction peaks for the KPN phase are slightly lower than those of the PN phase. (b) exhibits the enlarged diffraction peaks within the 2\u03b8 range of 27\u201330\xb0. It is observed that the main diffraction peak of (1 3 1) shifts towards lower angles, from 27.908\xb0(PN) to 27.681\xb0(KPN) with x from 0.05 to 0.20, indicating that the lattice parameters of the PKxNT ceramics increase. It is reported that the radius of KE^{+} (12 coordination, r = 1.78 \xc5) is larger than that of PbE^{2+} (r = 1.63 \xc5). The entrance of KE^{+} into the empty A-site would result in an increased cell volume, from 1224.0 \xc5E^{3} (PN) to 1252.1 \xc5E^{3} (KPN), which is in accordance with the increased lattice volume with x from 0.05 to 0.20, as listed. In addition, the intensity of partial diffraction peaks for the KPN phase differs from that of the PN phase. For example, the peak intensity of (0 2 1) in KPN is higher than that in PN. As (c) shows, the diffraction peak of (0 2 1) gradually increases with x, indicating that the PN phase gradually evolves into the KPN phase. Based on the experimental facts, we suggested that the introduction of KE^{+} into the PN-based matrix would result in an increase of the KPN phase. (a\u2013d) shows the SEM and EDS results of the PKxNT ceramics. It is observed from (a,b) that the PK0.05NT and PK0.10NT ceramics are fully densified with no pores detected. Fine cracks, as observed in (a), are common in PN-based ceramics, which are attributed to the excessive internal stress caused by abnormal grain growth during the sintering process. It is noticed that the fine cracks gradually disappear with x increasing, indicating that the introduction of KE^{+} could relieve the internal stress during the sintering process and reduce the fine cracks in consequence. In (d), the grain morphology of the PK0.20NT ceramic exhibits a distinct elongated columnar shape, which is not reported in the PN-based ceramics but is generally observed in other tungsten-bronze structured (TB) systems. As reported, the introduction of KE^{+} could reduce the surface energy of the crystal plane (0 0 1), leading to a faster grain growth rate along this direction. Therefore, the anisotropic grains are more likely related with the KPN fraction. The pores observed in (c-d) are suggested to correlate with the grain transformation from equiaxed to columnar, which contribute to the reduced densities at x = 0.15 and 0.20. lists the bulk and relative densities of the PKxNT ceramics sintered at 1230 \xb0C. To obtain the lattice volume of different samples, the diffraction peaks were fitted by the GSAS \u2161 software using the least-square approach. It is observed that the relative densities of the PK0.05NT and PK0.10NT ceramics stay above 93 %, which are higher than those of the PK0.15NT and PK0.20NT ceramics. The appearance of columnar grains indicates that the oriented grain growth happens in the PKxNT ceramics, which can be attributed to the grain growth habit of the tungsten-bronze structured systems and/or the mechanism of partial melting. It is also observed from the EDS results that the atomic proportion of K element increases with x, which also demonstrates the gradual increasing content of the KPN phase within the PKxNT matrix. It is suggested that the improved sintering behavior and the increased diffuse phase transition (DPT) via KE^{+}/TaE^{5+} co-substitution contributed to the enhanced piezoelectric performance, both in d 33 and Q m values. The DPT behavior will be discussed in. (a) plots the P-E hysteresis loops of the PKxNT ceramics, tested at 1 Hz and room temperature (RT). All P-E loops behave similarly to those of the orthorhombic PN-based ceramics with lossy characteristics. To clarify this phenomenon, d 33 values for different samples at various poling voltages and temperatures are present in (b,c). In (b), the d 33 values increase with the poling voltage initially and become saturated beyond 3 kV/mm gradually, indicating that all samples can be fully polarized at 4 kV/mm. The d 33 values poled at 3 kV/mm reach more than 95 % of the values obtained at 4 kV/mm. (c) presents the d 33 variations with the poling temperature, polarized at 4 kV/mm for 30 minutes. Obviously, the poling temperature has a significant effect on the polarization for the PN-based ceramics. The d 33 values for PK0.15NT and PK0.2NT poled at 150 \xb0C are even 50 % higher than those polarized at 100 \xb0C. The breakdown strengths of the PKxNT ceramics are around 4.5 kV/mm. Therefore, further increasing the poling voltage is not conducive for higher d 33 values. (a) shows the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the PKxNT ceramics, from which the valence states of major elements are studied. The high-resolution XPS profiles of Pb 4f and Nb 3d are fitted by the Gaussian-Lorenz function, as present in (b,c). It is observed that Pb and Nb co-exist well in all PKxNT ceramics with the valence states of + 2 and + 5, respectively. With the introduction of KE^{+} into the A-site vacancies with partially filling, the electron densities around the atoms at A- and B- sites increase, leading to the lowered orbital electron energies of Pb 4f and Nb 3d. Such procedure is confirmed from the peak shifts of Pb 4f and Nb 3d towards lower binding energies, as shown in (b,c). Raman spectra are effective in analyzing the evolution of the lattice structure. (a) exhibits the Raman spectra of the PKxNT ceramics within the waveband range of 50\u20131000 cmE^{\u22121}. As reported in other TTB-niobate compounds, three characteristic Raman peaks are related to the internal vibration modes of the [NbO6] octahedron, which are identified as O-Nb-O bending mode(\u03bd5 @\u223c250 cmE^{\u22121}), O-Nb-O stretching mode(\u03bd2 @\u223c635 cmE^{\u22121}), and Nb-O stretching mode(\u03bd1 @\u223c836 cmE^{\u22121}), respectively. No significant variations are observed from the internal vibration modes (\u03bd5, \u03bd2, and \u03bd1) at different x, indicating that all KE^{+} ions enter into A-sites and NbE^{5+}/TaE^{5+} ions retain identical distribution on B-sites, thus the internal vibration modes are not affected by KE^{+}. The Raman peaks located below 200 cmE^{\u22121} correspond to the external vibration modes, which are attributed to the motion of the cations at A-sites with respect to the oxygen octahedral framework of [NbO6]. It is conducive to reveal the evolution of the lattice structure from \u201cunfilled\u201d-TTB to \u201cfilled\u201d-TTB via analysing the Raman peaks below 200 cmE^{\u22121}. (b) shows the Raman spectra of the PKxNT ceramics within the waveband range of 50\u2013210 cmE^{\u22121}. Four vibration modes at 70 cmE^{\u22121}, 82 cmE^{\u22121}, 145 cmE^{\u22121}, and 206 cmE^{\u22121} are detected for the sample of x = 0.05. The Raman peak at 70 cmE^{\u22121} is reported to attribute to a constant occupancy of PbE^{2+} ions at A-sites. With x increasing, it is observed that the Raman peak around 82 cmE^{\u22121} disappears and the two peaks around 145 cmE^{\u22121} and 206 cmE^{\u22121} merge into a broad one gradually. The merged Raman peak is considered to relate with the disordered structure derived from the full occupancy of empty A-sites by KE^{+}. As was known, PbE^{2+} cations prefer to occupy the pentagonal A2 sites in PN. According to Olsen\u2019s structure refinement, two configurations dominate the vacancies at the square A1 sites, which reduce the sublattice disorder of A-sites. In KPN, the A-site disorder of the \u201cfilled\u201d TTB structure could be improved via the substitution of KE^{+} for PbE^{2+}, though KE^{+} preferentially occupies A2. Based on Sciau\u2019s neutron diffraction refinement results, the Pb/K distribution ratios are is 90/10 % at A1 and 55/45 % at A2, respectively. The PbE^{2+} cations in KPN, occupying two disordered positions at A2, deviate from the (2 mm) symmetry and increase the A-site sublattice disorder consequentially. (a\u2013d) exhibit the temperature dependence of the dielectric properties (\u03b5 r and tan\u03b4) of the PKxNT ceramics. It is noticed from (a) that two separated phase transition peaks are observed, as marked with Peak-A around 470 \xb0C belonging to KPN ceramics while Peak-B around 560 \xb0C from PN ceramics. It is noticed that the Peak-A is barely visible from \u03b5 r curves but clearly observed from tan\u03b4. The complete merged Peaks-A and -B are obtained at x = 0.20, accompanied by the disappearance of the loss peaks, as (d) shows. It is also observed from (a\u2013c) that another Peaks-C around 300 \xb0C present the characteristics of Frequency Dispersion, which have been reported by Zhao and Jin et al.. It is also noticed from (d) that the Peak-C gradually weakens with x and disappears at x = 0.20, indicating that the incorporation of KE^{+} could reduce the defect dipoles of the PN-based ceramics. (e) shows the temperature dependence of the dielectric constants (\u03b5 r) of the PKxNT ceramics at 1 MHz, from which the T C shifts towards lower temperatures with x increasing. Corresponding T C values of the PKxNT ceramics are exhibited in (f). It is notable that the T C value is decreased linearly with x, yielding to an intercept of 593 \xb1 1 \xb0C, as (f) shows. It is also noticed that the peak-width of the phase transition increases with x, behaving an enhanced diffuse phase transition (DPT) characteristic. Sahini et al. reported a relaxor behavior in K-substituted solid solutions of PbNb2O6. In our study, only DPT behaviors are observed in K/Ta co-substituted PbNb2O6 matrix. Further studies are requested at higher x values to elucidate the DPT and/or relaxor phenomena. For better understanding the phase transition of the PKxNT ceramics, it is noticed from that all specimens exhibit diffuse phase transition (DPT) behaviors on ferroelectric phase transition. is the modified formula of Curie-Weiss law proposed by Uchino et al. , which is often adopted to evaluate the character of the ferroelectric transition, namely whether diffuse or not, and the possible presence of high-temperature relaxor states via fitting the temperature dependent permittivity curves. Here \u03b5 m is the maximum dielectric permittivity; T m is its related temperature; \u03b3 indicates the character of the phase transition; C \u2032\u2032 is the Curie-like constant. To obtain the \u03b3 values of samples, was logarithmically transformed. Logarithmic deformation of is as follow:  (e\u2013h) exhibit the linear fitting results of the modified Curie-Weiss law on the plots of ln \u03b5 \u2032\u2212 \u03b5 m \u2032E^{1}E^{1} as a function of ln T\u2212 T m at 1 MHz, where the black dots represent the experimental data while the red solid-lines are the least-squared linear fitting results. The slope obtained from the linear fitting corresponds to the \u03b3 value of each sample. The fitted \u03b3 values are 1.43, 1.48, 1.55, and 1.58, corresponding to the samples of x = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20, respectively. It is reported that \u03b3= 1 represents a \u201cnormal\u201d ferroelectric phase transition and a relaxor behavior is obtained at \u03b3= 2; while 1 < \u03b3< 2 corresponds to a DPT related to the chemical inhomogeneity and associated distribution of transition temperatures. In this study, the \u03b3 values for all samples are within 1\u20132, confirming the diffuse character of the phase transition. Additionally, the \u03b3 value gradually increases with x, indicating that the DPT level increases. Considering the DPT behavior is usually related to the chemical inhomogeneity and defects, the introduction of KE^{+} could increase the disorder state at A-sites filled by PbE^{2+}/and KE^{+}, matching well with the Raman analysis. exhibit the variation of the d 33 values as a function of the annealing temperatures for the untreated(a) and heat-treated(b) PKxNT ceramics, measured at RT after annealing for 30 min. The first depolarization stage, along with softly declined d 33 values, occurs within the annealing temperature range of 100\u2013250 \xb0C for the samples of x = 0.05\u20130.15. Then the d 33 values remain stable at 250\u2013450 \xb0C. The second depolarization occurs near the T C region for each sample, followed by a dramatic decrease in d 33. The first depolarization and the stabilized d 33 values are attributed to the motion and stabilization processes of the domain walls. It is noticed that the d 33 values for the sample of x = 0.20 keep declining with the annealing temperature rising till 400 \xb0C, but still stay above 100 pC/N. To further verify the thermal stability of the piezoelectric performance, all annealed samples were heat-treated again at 350 \xb0C for 2 h and the d 33 values were measured at RT. It is observed from (b) that the first depolarization process is eliminated after the heat treatment and all samples exhibit excellent piezoelectric thermal stability below 400 \xb0C.

                     [Nb0.96Ta0.04]2O6 (PKxNT, xâ¯=â¯0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20) ceramics were prepared via the solid-state reaction method. It was discovered that the A-site vacancies filled by K+ induced the conversion of the tetragonal tungsten bronze (TTB) structure from âunfilledâ to âfilledâ. Two kinds of orthorhombic ferroelectric phases were indexed from the XRD profiles. The grain morphology was transformed from equiaxed to columnar and the diffuse phase transition (DPT) behavior was observed. Improved piezoelectric performance (d
                     33 = 141 pC/N) and reduced dielectric loss (tanÎ´ = 0.009) were obtained in the sample of PbK0.20NT. It is suggested that the strategy of K+/Ta5+ co-substitution could greatly improve the piezoelectric properties of the PbNb2O6-based ceramic, which is promising for expanding its application scenarios.

# INTRODUCTION
Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT)-based ceramics have been dominant for a long time due to their excellent piezoelectric properties and affordable prices. However, the lower T C for the PZT-based ceramics limits their applications for using above 300 \xb0C. Bismuth layer-structured ferroelectrics (BLSFs) are considered as one of the solutions for high-temperature applications due to their higher T C, such as CaBi2Nb2O9 (T C\u223c940 \xb0C) and Bi3TiNbO9 (T C\u223c900 \xb0C). However, the lower piezoelectric constant values (d 33<20 pC/N) of the BLSFs limit their practical applications. PbNb2O6 (PN) based ceramics with tetragonal tungsten bronze (TTB) crystal structure, possessing higher T C (570 \xb0C) and d 33 (\u223c70 pC/N) values, are expected to be applied at 300\u2013450 \xb0C. The diverse piezoelectric and dielectric properties of the PN-based ceramics are ascribed to the unique TTB structure with general formula of (A1)2(A2)4(C)4(B1)2(B2)8O30. Such frameworks are constituted of corner-shared [BO6] octahedrons. It is reported that its B sites are often occupied by NbE^{5+}, TaE^{5+}, TiE^{4+} with A-sites occupied by larger ions such as PbE^{2+}, BaE^{2+}, SrE^{2+}, KE^{+}, etc. As was known for the PN-based ceramics, 5 of the 6 A-sites are occupied by PbE^{2+}. In other words, A-sites are not completely filled, which are so called \u201cunfilled\u201d TTB. In addition, a \u201cfilled\u201d TTB is obtained in KPb2Nb5O15 (KPN), indicating completely filled A-sites. Due to its flexibility in lattice tolerance, diverse piezoelectric and dielectric properties of the PN-based ceramics are expected. Ion substitution is effective for improving the sintering behavior and piezoelectric properties of the PN-based ceramics. The addition of TiE^{4+} not only contributed to the densification, but also increased its Curie temperature. Chen obtained promising piezoelectric performance (d 33 = 92 pC/N and T C = 513 \xb0C) in Ba/Ti co-doped PN ceramics. In Ca/Mn co-doped PN-based ceramics, Cai et al. found that the A/B-site co-doping was effective to obtain stable piezoelectric and dielectric performance. Yuan et al. reported a densified Pb0.95Ba0.05Nb2O6 piezoelectric ceramic with WE^{6+} modification, which improved the d 33 value to 108 pC/N and reduced the dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) to 0.006. Jin obtained excellent piezoelectric performance (d 33 = 90 pC/N, tan\u03b4 = 0.005) in Ba/Ti co-doped PN-based ceramics with x mol% of MnO2. Considering the importance of A-site occupied condition to the performance of the TTB structured PN-based ceramics, we investigated the evolution process from the \u201cunfilled\u201d TTB-PN to the \u201cfilled\u201d TTB-KPN via substituting PbE^{2+} with KE^{+}. To maintain electrical neutrality, two KE^{+} cations are introduced to substitute one PbE^{2+}. Therefore, all A-sites in each unit cell are expected to be fully filled by KE^{+} ions.

# CONCLUSION
In this study, dense Pb(1-x)K2x [Nb0.96Ta0.04]2O6 (PKxNT, x = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20) were prepared via the conventional solid-state reaction method. XRD analysis revealed that the crystalline structure was transformed from the \u201cunfilled\u201d TTB (PN-based) to the \u201cfilled\u201d TTB (KPN-based) via the introduction of KE^{+}. SEM results exhibited that the grain morphology was evolved from equiaxed to columnar. Diffuse phase transition (DPT) behavior was also studied. All samples exhibit good thermal stability below 400 \xb0C after heat-treated at 350 \xb0C for 2 h. In general, the sample of PK0.20NT presents excellent properties: d 33 = 141 pC/N, tan\u03b4 = 0.009, k p = 0.31, Q m = 175, and T C = 481 \xb0C. The experimental results indicate that the modification strategy on A-site from \u201cunfilled\u201d to \u201cfilled\u201d is feasible for the PN-based piezoelectric ceramics with greatly improved piezoelectric performance.
