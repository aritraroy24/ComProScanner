Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'Conventional solid state reaction', 'precursors': ['Na2CO3', 'BaCO3', 'Bi2O3', 'TiO2', 'SrCO3'], 'steps': ['Drying raw materials at approximately 120°C for 5 hours', 'Mixing raw materials by ball milling for 12 hours with ethanol', 'Calcining at 850°C for 2 hours', 'Ball milling for another 12 hours', 'Granulating by passing through 80 mesh sieve with PVA aqueous solution as a binder', 'Heating to 800°C for 2 hours to remove the binder', 'Sintering at 1140°C-1180°C for 2 hours', 'Heating polished ceramic disks to 1100°C for 1 hour', 'Quenching in air or cooling in furnace'], 'characterization_techniques': ['X-ray diffraction', 'Precision impedance analyzer', 'Quasi-static d33 meter', 'Thermally stimulated depolarization current', 'Modified Sawyer-Tower circuit']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
