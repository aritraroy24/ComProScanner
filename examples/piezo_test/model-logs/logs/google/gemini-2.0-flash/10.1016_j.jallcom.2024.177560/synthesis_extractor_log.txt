The chemical formula of LaE^{3+} and NbE^{5+} ionic co-doped ceramics is 0.3PT\u20130.65PZ\u20130.05BLZT\u2013x wt% LN (PT\u2013PZ\u2013BLZT\u2013xLN, x = 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), where LN is an additive composing of a certain proportion of La2O3 and Nb2O5. First, the raw powders of La2O3 (99.9 %) and Nb2O5 (99.9 %) mixed at a mass ratio of 3:2 were ball-milled in ethanol for 12 hours, after that, the mixture was sieved to prepare the LN additive. The high-purity raw powders of PbO, TiO2, ZrO2, Bi2O3, and La2O3 were weighed based on the 0.3PT\u20130.65PZ\u20130.05BLZT formula, the mixed powders were then combined with ethanol and ball-milled for 16 hours. After that, the mixtures were dried in an oven at 80 \u2103 for 1\u20132 hours and calcined at 820 \u2103 for 2 hours. The synthesized powders were weighted based on the PT\u2013PZ\u2013BLZT\u2013xLN formula and then subjected to secondary ball milling, drying, and sieving processes. Afterward, the granulated powders were pressed into 12 mm thick sheets under the granulation of 5 % polyvinyl alcohol. The sheets were sintered at 600 \u2103 for 4 hours to remove the binder, followed by sintering at 1230 \u2103 for 2 hours to synthesize the ceramic samples. Finally, the ceramic surfaces were polished to maintain a uniform thickness of approximately 0.3 mm. The crystal structure of PT\u2013PZ\u2013BLZT\u2013xLN (x = 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) piezoelectric ceramics was analyzed by X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D8 Advance, Bruker). Rietveld refinement was performed using GSAS II software, with the space group of the structure chosen as R3m. The Raman spectra of the samples in the range of 100\u2013900 cmE^{\u22121} were tested using a Raman spectrometer (Raman, LabRAM HR, Renishaw, UK). The piezoelectric coefficient of the sample was measured using a piezo-d 33 m (ZJ-3A, Institute of Acoustics, China) test instrument. The impedance analyzer (Agilent, 4294 A, USA) was used to test the mechanical quality factor Q m and planar electromechanical coupling coefficient k p of the samples. A dielectric temperature spectrometer (FZ-IV, Taidao, China) was used to test the dielectric properties of the samples at different frequencies. The hysteresis loop and strain of the samples were measured using a ferroelectric analyzer (4284 A, Agilent, USA) under a frequency of 1 Hz, with the test voltage controlled between 1 kV to 3 kV according to the thickness of the samples. The domain shape at room temperature was observed using piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM, Cypher ES, OXFORD, UK). Scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, SUPRATM55, Germany) was used to observe the microscopic morphology of ceramic samples. The ceramic samples were polished and then chemically etched with 1 % hydrofluoric acid (HF) and hydrochloric acid (HCl). After an initial etching for 1 second, the samples were quickly immersed in a 30 % nitric acid solution (HNO3) for 3 seconds.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a) shows the XRD patterns of PT\u2013PZ\u2013BLZT\u2013xLN (x = 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) ceramic materials. Upon examination at a 2\u03b8 angle of 44\xb0, the absence of a split in the (200) peak indicates the existence of a rhombohedral (R) phase. A magnification of the (002) diffraction peak, as depicted in (b), reveals that the peak shifts towards a higher angle with an increase in the dopant concentration. This is owing to the different ionic radius of PbE^{2+} (r = 1.19 \xc5) and LaE^{3+} (r = 1.16 \xc5) at the A-site, as well as between ZrE^{4+} (r = 0.72 \xc5), TiE^{4+} (r = 0.61 \xc5), and NbE^{5+} (r = 0.64 \xc5) at the B-site. As a result, cation vacancies are formed within the PT\u2013PZ\u2013BLZT\u2013xLN ceramics to sustain electrical neutrality. To further investigate the factors influencing strain, the samples were analyzed by Rietveld refinement analysis using GSAS-II software to analyze the phase composition in detail. (d-i) displays the XRD profiles for the PT\u2013PZ\u2013BLZT\u2013xLN ceramics (x = 0, 5, 7) after whole pattern fitting. The t value is calculated by , which can be explained by the general formula ABO3. where RA, RB, and RO represent the ionic radii of PbE^{2+} and LaE^{3+}, the ionic radius of NbE^{5+}, TiE^{4+}, and ZrE^{4+}, and the radius of OE^{2-}, respectively. According to is evident that the substitution of LaE^{3+} (with an ionic radius of 1.16 \xc5) for PbE^{2+} (with an ionic radius of 1.19 \xc5) results in a decrease in the molecular dimensions as described in , consequently leading to a reduction in the t value. The Gaussian and Lorentz fitting methods were applied to the Raman spectral data of PT\u2013PZ\u2013BLZT\u2013xLN by using the Peakfit software, as shown in (a). The Raman mode below 200 cmE^{\u22121} is related to the vibrational motion occurring at the A-site within the perovskite crystal lattice. The peak at 125 cmE^{\u22121} undergoes a red shift as x increases. This phenomenon may be attributed to the cationic migration along the crystallographic axis, which could be linked to the displacement of LaE^{3+} ions at the non-centrosymmetric A-site. The vibrational behavior of the B\u2212O bonds and the [BO6] octahedra are manifested in the Raman modes within the wavenumber ranges of 200 cmE^{\u22121} to 400 cmE^{\u22121} and 400 cmE^{\u22121} to 700 cmE^{\u22121}, respectively. The distortions of these B\u2212O bonds and [BO6] octahedra are closely associated with the dynamical properties of the polar nanoregions (PNRs) within the perovskite framework, which reflects the relaxation contributions from the B-site. As illustrated in (c), the increment in the doping concentration of x results in a gradual decrease in the B\u2212O bond length. The bond strength of the B\u2212O bond is quantified through the. where R denotes the refined bond length of the B\u2212O bond, R 1 = 1.907, and N = 5 represent the standard bond length and bond length parameters, respectively. The computational results indicate an enhancement in the bond strength between the B\u2212O bonds, suggesting that the contraction of the [BO6] octahedra and the shortening of the B\u2212O bond are the result of the incorporation of NbE^{5+} at the B-site. Consequently, this led to a strengthening of the B\u2212O bond. This strengthening induces a blue shift within the 200\u2013400 cmE^{\u22121} range. The enhanced bond strength of the B\u2212O bonds contributes to the stabilization of the relaxation state and the non-polar state within the system. (a-f) displays the SEM images of the ceramics sintered at 1230 \u2103. Measuring the average grain size (AGS) of these samples using the line intercept method using nanoscale measurement software allows for an in-depth study of the effect of grain size on piezoelectric properties. The AGS values are 10.63 \u03bcm, 1.63 \u03bcm, 2.00 \u03bcm, 2.38 \u03bcm, 2.50 \u03bcm, and 2.71 \u03bcm when the doping levels of x reach 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, respectively. This effect may be attributed to NbE^{5+} providing excess electrons when it substitutes for TiE^{4+}, which reduces the concentration of oxygen vacancy and inhibits mass transfer during sintering, resulting in a decrease in grain size. The reduction of the 90\xb0 domain within is facilitated by the small grain size. Consequently, the activity of these 90\xb0 domains increases. This phenomenon is reflected as an enhancement in the piezoelectric coefficient and an improvement in the material\u2019s piezoelectric properties. depicts the Energy-Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) spectrum of the sample at x = 5. Nb has a higher electronegativity (1.6) than Ti (1.54) and Zr (1.33), hence, the B\u2212O bond in [BO6] octahedron may be shortened by the strong interaction between Nb and O. When the size of microdomains decreases to nanoscale, PNRs can be found. To directly observe the effect of LaE^{3+} and NbE^{5+} co-doping on domain size, PFM is utilized to study the domains in ceramic samples at x = 0 and x = 5, with the results shown in. In the domain at x = 0, the structure is characterized by the presence of small, uniformly distributed parallel fringe domains. Conversely, the piezoelectric ceramic at x = 5 displays a complex, labyrinthine surface domain pattern with domains oriented randomly. The labyrinthine domain structure with reduced dimensions is instrumental in conferring the superior piezoelectric properties observed in PT\u2013PZ\u2013BLZT\u2013xLN piezoelectric ceramics, as further detailed in Ref.. (a) depicts the dielectric properties of the PT\u2013PZ\u2013BLZT\u2013xLN ceramic samples. The results indicate that there is a steady decline in the relative dielectric constant, designated as \u03b5 r, of the samples. is used to further analyze how the co-doping of LaE^{3+} and NbE^{5+} affects the relaxor behavior of ceramics. In the equation, \u03b5 max is the maximum relative permittivity, \u03b3 represents the dispersion factor, the dispersion factor is denoted by C, which is a constant, and T max is the temperature that the piezoelectric ceramics exhibit the maximum relative permittivity. For a normal ferroelectric, the \u03b3 value ranging from 1 to 2 determines the degree of ferroelectric relaxation, The larger the \u03b3, the stronger the relaxation ferroelectric behavior. When the doping amount increases to x = 5, the \u03b3 value increases from 1.30 to 1.82, which indicates a substantial enhancement in the relaxor properties of the PT\u2013PZ\u2013BLZT\u2013xLN piezoelectric ceramics. The doping of LaE^{3+} and NbE^{5+} may have disrupted the original electrical domains, leading to the emergence of microdomains. Additionally, the introduction of LaE^{3+} and NbE^{5+} may strengthen the disorder of cations, forming smaller PNRs. It has been reported that when LaE^{3+} enters the lattice, the introduction of LaE^{3+} replaces PbE^{2+} at the A-site and creates vacancies, as shown in :  The defect chemistry resulting from the doping of high-valent dopants at the A-site significantly impacts the relaxation properties of piezoelectric ceramics. The T c, \u03b5 r, and tan\u03b4 values of the PT\u2013PZ\u2013BLZT\u2013xLN ceramics are shown in (c). As the doping amount of LaE^{3+} and NbE^{5+} ions increase, both the Curie temperature and the relative permittivity reduce. It is noteworthy that the minimum dielectric loss is achieved when x = 5. As seen in (d-i), the observed samples demonstrate typical relaxor ferroelectric characteristics, meaning that the change in the \u03b5 r near the dielectric maximum value T m shows a broad curve. This is because co-doping with LaE^{3+} and NbE^{5+} ions likely alters the balance of energy states within the material, consequently affecting the characteristics. Additionally, the coercive field (E c) is reduced from 8.85 kV\xb7cmE^{\u22121} to 4.86 kV\xb7cmE^{\u22121}, and the remanent polarization (P r) decreases from 26 \u03bcC/cm\xb2 to 6 \u03bcC/cm\xb2. The maximum polarization (P max) also decreases from 35.06 \u03bcC/cm\xb2 to 30 \u03bcC/cm\xb2. At x = 5, the current peak splits into two distinct peaks, as depicted in (d). Moreover, non-equivalent substitutions, such as PbE^{2+} vacancies, can result in charge enrichment and the formation of defective dipoles, as described in Refs.. These defective dipoles can drive the formation of a charged polarized topological center, influencing the polarization reversal behavior of the material and leading to the emergence of peak splitting. (a-f) displays the strain of the PT\u2013PZ\u2013BLZT\u2013xLN (x = 3, 5, 7) piezoelectric ceramics. It can be observed that the unipolar strain increases from 0.3 % to 0.45 % after the co-doping of LaE^{3+} and NbE^{5+} ions. presents a comparative analysis of the performance of piezoelectric ceramics as reported in different studies, where the rest of the properties can be found in. The piezoelectric ceramics synthesized in this study demonstrate great piezoelectric properties, including strain, strain hysteresis, and the d 33 piezoelectric coefficient.

The piezoelectric ceramics synthesized in this study demonstrate great piezoelectric properties, including strain, strain hysteresis, and the d 33 piezoelectric coefficient.
**Notes**:
- For precursors, just use the chemical name (no company or purity) and for characterization_techniques, only the instrument name or short name of the instrument for the instruments like XRD, Raman Spectroscopy, SEM, TEM etc.
- For synthesis_methods, use the short name of the method if possible, else write the full name and don't use method/reaction word at the end.
- For precursors, just use the chemical composition (if available) else chemical name (no company or purity)
- For characterization_techniques, try using short name of the characterization techniques like XRD, Raman Spectroscopy, SEM, TEM etc. if possible, else write the full name.
