Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'Combining', 'precursors': [], 'steps': ['The damping back cover, piezoelectric ceramic stack, flange plate, amplifying front cover, fixture rod, and tool rod are combined into a whole with a high-strength bolt made of 45-gauge steel.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['Impedance analyzer', 'LCR meter']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
