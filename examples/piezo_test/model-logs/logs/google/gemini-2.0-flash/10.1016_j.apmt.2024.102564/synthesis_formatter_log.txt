Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'Film deposition by dropping, solvent removal by spontaneous evaporation, forced drying with warm air, or spin-coating', 'precursors': ['L-phenylalanyl-L-leucine', 'L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine', 'Methanol'], 'steps': ['Prepare a dipeptide solution in methanol (1 mg/mL).', 'Drop 10 μL of the solution onto a silicon substrate.', 'Remove the solvent by: spontaneous evaporation, forced drying with warm air, or spin-coating (3000 rpm).', 'Saturate the film with organic solvent vapor in a Petri dish for 10 minutes to 24 hours.', 'Dry the film with warm air (45°C).'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRPD', 'Raman spectroscopy', 'AFM', 'PFM']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
