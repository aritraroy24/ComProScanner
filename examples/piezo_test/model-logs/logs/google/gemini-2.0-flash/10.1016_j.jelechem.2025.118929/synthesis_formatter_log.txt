Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same.

**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'Sol-gel', 'precursors': ['Ta2O5', 'CH3COOLi·2H2O', 'C4H6O6'], 'steps': ['Ta2O5, CH3COOLi·2H2O, and C4H6O6 were separately dissolved in ethanol', 'The solution was mixed with commercial LCO powders and vigorously stirred', 'The mixed solution was evaporated and stirred at 80 °C until a sol was formed', 'The sol was aged at 120 °C for 10 h to obtain a gel', 'The powder was annealed at 500 °C for 12 h and then cooled to room temperature', 'LTO powders were compacted into disk by uniaxial pressing in a stainless-steel die using polyvinyl butyral binder', 'The disk was sintered in air at 500 °C for 3 h'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'SEM', 'EDS', 'TEM', 'XPS', 'Quasistatic d33 meter', 'Precision LCR meter']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
