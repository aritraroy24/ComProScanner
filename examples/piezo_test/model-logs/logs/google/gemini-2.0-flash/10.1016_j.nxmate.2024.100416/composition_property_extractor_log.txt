# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a) presents the XRD patterns of P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 composite thin films with varying volume fractions, \xd8. The peak at 2\u03b8 = 19.91\xb0 is assigned to the (110/200) reflection of \u03b2-phase crystal plane of P(VDF-TrFE) copolymer. The orthorhombic unit cell of the \u03b2-phase is packed with the CF2 groups with each chain aligned parallel to the b-axis and possesses a large spontaneous polarization P s. The diffraction peak at (110) plane (2\u03b8 = 30.3\xb0) corresponds to the perovskite phase of sodium bismuth titanate. The diffraction peaks at the plane (003/021) and (202/220) attributed to the rhombohedral-tetragonal morphotropic phase boundary of NBT. The intensities of the peak at the 19.7\xb0 is associated to the crystalline (110) and (200) planes of all-trans conformation. The crystalline conformation of the P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 composites confirmed by transmission IR spectra (see ). The infrared-active vibrations for copolymer are concentrated at the narrow range of 400\u20131500 cmE^{\u22121} due to the large mass of the fluorine atoms. The characteristic vibration spectra of \u03b2-phase P(VDF-TrFE) was observed at four intense bands of 510, 850, 1288 and 1400 cmE^{\u22121}. The bands at 510 and 1400 cmE^{\u22121} are referred to as CF2 bending mode within all trans (TTTT) segment along the chain and CH2 wagging vibration, respectively. The bands at 850, 876 and 1288 cmE^{\u22121} are assigned to CF2 stretching mode , while the band at 1174 cmE^{\u22121} assigned to the C-C bond. Infrared spectroscopy revealed no significant changes in the \u03b2-phase content of P(VDF-TrFE) upon the addition of NBT-0.6 CeO2, indicating that the filler does not induce phase transformations. Consistent with the decrease in crystallinity, the intensity of the P(VDF-TrFE) bands weakens as the volume fraction of ceramic fillers increases. presents the surface morphology of BNT-0.6CeO2 nanoparticles, pure P(VDF-TrFE), and P(VDF-TrFE)/BNT-0.6CeO2 composites with filler loadings of 0.15 and 0.25 vol fraction (scale bar: 1 \xb5m). Higher magnification images (scale bar: 500 nm) are provided as insets. The pure polymer exhibits a lamellar structure with rod-like crystallites of approximately 100 nm. At 0.15 vol%, BNT-0.6CeO2 nanoparticles are well-dispersed within the polymer matrix. However, increasing the filler loading to 0.25 vol% promotes agglomeration, potentially due to surface area effects and interparticle interactions. This agglomeration can contribute to the formation of conductive pathways which caused rapid decline in material performance (see Fig. 8 & 9 below). illustrates the frequency dependence of dielectric constant \u03b5' and dielectric loss \u03b5'' for P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 nanocomposites with varying ceramic filler content, measured at room temperature. The relationship between the complex dielectric permittivity, \u03b5 *=\u03b5\u2019\u2212i\u03b5\u201d and complex conductivity, \u03c3*=\u03c3\u2019+i\u03c3\u201d are expressed by the following equations, where, \u03c9 (= 2\u03c0f) is the angular frequency and f is the frequency. At lower frequencies, both \u03b5' and \u03b5'' increase with increasing filler volume fraction. The higher ceramic filler content leads to increased \u03b5' and \u03b5'' due to the space charge effect. Moreover, the NBT-0.6 CeO2 ceramic filler has a higher conductivity compared to the polymer matrix. As the volume fraction of this filler increases, its contribution to the overall conductivity of the composite also rises, leading to the observed increase in \u03b5''. The P(VDF-TrFE) composite was modeled by a two-phase dispersion system where phase 1 represents the polymer matrix; P(VDF-TrFE) and phase 2 is the ceramic fillers; NBT-0.6 CeO2. The effective dielectric constants of the polymer nanocomposite can be predicted from various theoretical models such as Furukawa , Clausius\u2212Mossotti , Maxwell and the effective medium theory (EMT). These models are strongly influenced by the size, shape and volume fraction of the fillers. presents the dielectric properties (measured at 1 kHz and room temperature) of P(VDF-TrFE) nanocomposites as a function of NBT-0.6CeO2 volume fraction. The Clausius\u2212Mossotti model which also assumes a simple binary composite, provides a reasonable fit at lower ceramic concentration (<0.05) but deviates from experimental data at higher concentrations. To account for the non-spherical morphology of BNT-0.6CeO2 particles (a), we also employed the Maxwell and effective medium theory (EMT) models. The EMT model incorporates a shape parameter, n. A value of n = 0 indicates a spherical particle, n = 1 represents a cylindrical particle, and n = 0.5 corresponds to a disc-shaped particle. Our experimental results were best described by the EMT model with n = 0.27, suggesting a non-spherical filler morphology which aligns with the observed square and rectangular shapes of BNT-0.6CeO2 particles in the FESEM images. The EMT model, considering the filler's shape, provides a more accurate representation of the composite's dielectric properties. Generally at the room temperature, two relaxation (\u03b1- and \u03b2-) processes observed in the P(VDF-TrFE) dielectric spectrum which are related to the crystalline motion. These relaxation processes were fitted using the Havriliak-Negami (HN) function : where \u03b5 \u221e is the instantaneous permittivity, \u2206\u03b5 is the dielectric strength, \u03c4 is the relaxation time, a and b are parameters describing the distribution of relaxation time and \u03c9 is the angular frequency. displays the observed and fitted spectra of \u03b5\u2032and\u03b5\u2033 of unpoled P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 composites across various volume fractions. A prominent \u03b2-relaxation peak, attributed to the crystalline chain segments of P(VDF-TrFE) was identified within the MHz frequency range at room temperature. Fitting the P(VDF-TrFE) data at room temperature yielded parameters: \u2206\u03b5 = 3.1, \u03c4 = 5.3 \xd710E^{\u22127} s, a =1, b = 0.81 for the \u03b2-relaxation. The intensity and peak position of this relaxation shifted towards higher frequencies with increasing temperature from 25\xb0C to 120\xb0C for both pure P(VDF-TrFE) and composite films. illustrates the resulting \u03b2-relaxation dielectric strength (\u2206\u03b5) and relaxation time (\u03c4) obtained from HN function fitting. The \u2206\u03b5of the \u03b2-relaxation initially increased with filler content up to 0.20 vol fraction, likely due to enhanced \u03b2-phase crystallinity induced by well-dispersed ceramic particles. However, further filler addition to 0.25 vol fraction led to a decrease in dielectric strength, attributed to filler aggregation, increased interfacial defects, and the formation of conductive pathways. In addition, the \u03c4 reduced with increasing filler concentration showing a similar trend, suggesting hindered polymer chain mobility at higher filler concentrations. The ferroelectric nature of NBT-0.6 CeO2 particles likely influences the relaxation behavior through interactions with the polymer's dipolar groups, potentially altering the trap level distribution within the composite films, as reported in. The P-E hysteresis behavior of P(VDF-TrFE) and P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 thin film composites at room temperature is shown in (a). The pure NBT-0.6 CeO2 ceramics exhibited a remanent polarization, P r of 560 mC/mE^{2} and a coercive field, E c of 5 MV/m, while the P(VDF-TrFE) polymer exhibited P r of 80 mC/mE^{2} and E c of 76 MV/m respectively. (b) shows the P r and E c of the samples with various volume fraction of ceramic fillers. Incorporating NBT-0.6 CeO2 ceramic as fillers has enhanced the remanent polarization and simultaneously reduced the coercive field in the composite system. When the volume fraction increased from 0 to 0.2, the remanent polarization was 166 mC/mE^{2} while reduced the coercive field from 76 MV/m to 55 MV/m compared with pure P(VDF-TrFE). However, adding more NBT-0.6 CeO2 above 0.2 vol fraction reduced the remanent polarization to 79 mC/mE^{2} even though the coercive field decreased. The enhancement of ferroelectric properties in P(VDF-TrFE) is governed by the conductivity in the series model. When the NBT-0.6 CeO2 increased to \u03d5 = 0.25, the pyroelectricity and ferroelectricity in the polymer phase were obscured by the direct current conduction in the parallel model. The internal fields, E and the electric displacements, D in the parallel model yields where subscripts 1 and 2 refer to matrix and fillers, respectively. When the electric field was applied during the polling process, the present of the NBT-0.6 CeO2 nanoparticles in the polymer matrix of P(VDF-TrFE) formed space charge layers at the interface between the ceramic and the polymer. The Maxwell\u2212Wagner\u2019s model considers the conductivity of the fillers of the composite thin film. Consequently, the space charges in the P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 nanocomposite can drift and accumulate at the boundary of the fillers and the polymer matrix interfaces at the faster rate to compensate for the discontinuity of the electric displacement at the location. The pyroelectric coefficient of the composite thin films with various volume fractions of NBT-0.6 CeO2 was plotted and shown in (b). The pyroelectric coefficients of the composite thin films increase proportionately with the increase of NBT-0.6 CeO2 volume fractions. The highest pyroelectric coefficient was obtained at \u03d5= 0.20 which is \u223c43 \u03bcC/mE^{2}K. This value is 34 % higher than the pure P(VDF-TrFE). Moreover, as observed in the ferroelectric result, we also see a similar trend with the pyroelectric coefficient of the samples with \u03d5= 0.25 where the pyroelectric coefficient is reduced to 35 \u03bcC/mE^{2}K. Since the value of \u03b5 2 is always found to be larger than \u03b5 1, thus, the local electric field applied on polymer matrix is much higher than the local electric field on the ceramic fillers. In addition, since the pyroelectric coefficient both NBT-0.6 CeO2 ceramic (650 \u03bcC/mE^{2}K) and the P(VDF-TrFE) (32 \u03bcC/mE^{2}K) have positive sign, thus, the ceramic and the copolymer phases in the P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 nanocomposite are poled in the same direction, consequently enhanced the pyroelectricity of the composite films. In the P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 nanocomposite, the formation of space charge layers at the interface is due to the presence of NBT-0.6 CeO2 ferroelectric nanoparticles. The nanoparticles\u2019 attraction causes copolymer molecules close to the nanoparticle interactive surface to become more mobile. This is due to the high ratio of free volume areas exhibited by nanoparticles (1000-fold higher compared to particles of micrometer size). In addition, the marked increase in the pyroelectric coefficient is attributed to the conductivity of the ceramic in the composite system, the phase structure of P(VDF-TrFE) and the promotion of non-homogeneous domain at lowered activation field in the absence of fillers. The higher volume fraction of NBT-0.6 CeO2 filler in a polymer matrix will contribute to higher d.c conduction in a nanocomposite. Thus, the optimum volume fraction of NBT-0.6 CeO2 dispersed in the polymer nanocomposite thin films should not be more than \u03d5= 0.20. shows the leakage current density versus electric field (J-E) plot of P(VDF-TrFE) and P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 thin film composites measured at room temperature. The leakage current density increases with the increase of electric field and saturated above 10 MV/m. From the graph, it is obvious that the leakage current increase from 10E^{\u22126} A/cm to 10E^{\u22123} A/cm with the increasing volume fraction of NBT-0.6 CeO2 ceramic from \u03d5 = 0.0 to \u03d5= 0.25. The leakage current in NBT-0.6 CeO2 is usually attributed to space charges, such as oxygen vacancies, which are induced by Bi volatilization during the sintering process and space charges between doping ion CeO2, and NBT with hole-carries. The piezoelectric constant, d 33, was measured for the bulk film (or free-standing film) of P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 composite at an optimized state for ferroelectric and pyroelectric properties. Only the optimized composite film with a volume fraction of 0.20, was the subject of investigation. The NBT-0.6 CeO2 ceramics exhibited a positive sign of d 33 = 90 pC/N, while the P(VDF-TrFE) polymer exhibited a negative sign of d 33 = \u221238 pC/N. The average of d 33 constant of 0.2 P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 was \u223c 49 pC/N. Thus, we have compared various P(VDF-TrFE) composites properties in the literature with our works as shown in. The piezoelectric constant and remanent polarization that we obtained from our work are i.e. d 33 = 49 pC/N and P r = 166 mC/mE^{2}, respectively. In addition, the poling field was also improved with the E c value of 55 MV/m at the low volume fraction, \u03d5 of 0.20. The observed piezoelectric constant and remanent polarization in our composite is notably high compared to literature values, especially considering the low volume fraction of 0.20. This suggests that the unique combination of NBT-0.6CeO2 and P(VDF-TrFE) in our composite effectively enhances the piezoelectric properties.

                     Mossotti, Furukawa, and effective medium theory (EMT).

The optimum concentration of NBT-0.6 CeO2 filler was determined to be 0.2âvol fraction resulting in a remarkable enhancement of the key parameters.

# INTRODUCTION
These properties make ferroelectrics highly sought-after for a variety of applications, including capacitors, dielectric resonators, sensors, transducers, actuators, and nonvolatile memories, optical waveguides, displays, and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) with miniature mechanical and electromechanical elements. Among the polymers, ferroelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and its copolymers with trifluoroethylene (P(VDF-TrFE)) stand out for their excellent balance of mechanical compliance, reasonable dielectric properties, and piezoelectric response. However, unlike most ferroelectric materials, PVDF and P(VDF-TrFE) exhibit negative piezoelectricity, meaning they contract upon application of an electric field in the polarization direction. This complex interplay between the polymer matrix and potential ceramic fillers presents a significant challenge in developing unified strategies to optimize the electromechanical properties of PVDF and P(VDF-TrFE) based composites. Ferroelectric ceramic fillers such as lead titanate (PT), lead zirconate titanate (PZT), lead magnesium niobate (PMN-PT), barium doped lead zirconate (BPZT) or barium titanate (BTO) embedded in the ferroelectric polymer matrix of PVDF and its copolymer P(VDF-TrFE) were reported for the past few decades to improve the electrical functional properties of the polymer composite films. The search for lead-free alternatives to traditional ferroelectric materials has led to extensive research on various perovskite-structured ferroelectrics (FEs). These include Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3 (NBT), BaTiO3 (BT), (K0.5Bi0.5)TiO3 (KBT), and (K,Na)NbO3 (KNN)-based solid solutions. Notably, NBT has emerged as a prominent candidate due to its exceptional properties in recent years, including giant field-induced strain, high stiffness, and remarkable fatigue resistance. However, despite these strengths, NBT exhibits drawbacks compared to lead-based counterparts: a diffuse phase transition, lower Curie temperature, and high electrical conductivity, leading to unwanted energy dissipation and hindered functionalities. To address these limitations, in our previous work, we explored the introduction of cerium oxide (CeO2) into the NBT crystal lattice, successfully altering and enhancing its properties. Building upon the prior research, this study investigates the potential of optimized NBT-0.6 mass % CeO2 ceramic fillers embedded in a P(VDF-TrFE) polymer matrix to enhance the composite's functional properties. The aim of the investigation was to study the impact of electroactive fillers (NBT-0.6 mass % CeO2) on the dielectric, ferroelectric and the piezoelectric properties of P(VDF-TrFE).

# CONCLUSION
This study presents a comprehensive investigation of a novel P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6CeO2 composite. By incorporating NBT-0.6CeO2 ceramic fillers, we significantly enhanced the composite's dielectric, ferroelectric, and pyroelectric properties. The optimal filler concentration was determined to be 0.2 vol fraction, resulting in substantial improvements in key performance metrics. The composite demonstrated a remarkable 110 % increase in remnant polarization, a 35 % increase in pyroelectric coefficient, and a piezoelectric constant of 49 pC/N. Theoretical models, including EMT, accurately described the composite's dielectric behavior. These findings highlight the potential of P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6CeO2 composites for applications in energy storage and intelligent piezoelectric systems.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a) presents the XRD patterns of P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 composite thin films with varying volume fractions, \xd8. The peak at 2\u03b8 = 19.91\xb0 is assigned to the (110/200) reflection of \u03b2-phase crystal plane of P(VDF-TrFE) copolymer. The orthorhombic unit cell of the \u03b2-phase is packed with the CF2 groups with each chain aligned parallel to the b-axis and possesses a large spontaneous polarization P s. The diffraction peak at (110) plane (2\u03b8 = 30.3\xb0) corresponds to the perovskite phase of sodium bismuth titanate. The diffraction peaks at the plane (003/021) and (202/220) attributed to the rhombohedral-tetragonal morphotropic phase boundary of NBT. The intensities of the peak at the 19.7\xb0 is associated to the crystalline (110) and (200) planes of all-trans conformation. The crystalline conformation of the P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 composites confirmed by transmission IR spectra (see ). The infrared-active vibrations for copolymer are concentrated at the narrow range of 400\u20131500 cmE^{\u22121} due to the large mass of the fluorine atoms. The characteristic vibration spectra of \u03b2-phase P(VDF-TrFE) was observed at four intense bands of 510, 850, 1288 and 1400 cmE^{\u22121}. The bands at 510 and 1400 cmE^{\u22121} are referred to as CF2 bending mode within all trans (TTTT) segment along the chain and CH2 wagging vibration, respectively. The bands at 850, 876 and 1288 cmE^{\u22121} are assigned to CF2 stretching mode , while the band at 1174 cmE^{\u22121} assigned to the C-C bond. Infrared spectroscopy revealed no significant changes in the \u03b2-phase content of P(VDF-TrFE) upon the addition of NBT-0.6 CeO2, indicating that the filler does not induce phase transformations. Consistent with the decrease in crystallinity, the intensity of the P(VDF-TrFE) bands weakens as the volume fraction of ceramic fillers increases. presents the surface morphology of BNT-0.6CeO2 nanoparticles, pure P(VDF-TrFE), and P(VDF-TrFE)/BNT-0.6CeO2 composites with filler loadings of 0.15 and 0.25 vol fraction (scale bar: 1 \xb5m). Higher magnification images (scale bar: 500 nm) are provided as insets. The pure polymer exhibits a lamellar structure with rod-like crystallites of approximately 100 nm. At 0.15 vol%, BNT-0.6CeO2 nanoparticles are well-dispersed within the polymer matrix. However, increasing the filler loading to 0.25 vol% promotes agglomeration, potentially due to surface area effects and interparticle interactions. This agglomeration can contribute to the formation of conductive pathways which caused rapid decline in material performance (see Fig. 8 & 9 below). illustrates the frequency dependence of dielectric constant \u03b5' and dielectric loss \u03b5'' for P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 nanocomposites with varying ceramic filler content, measured at room temperature. The relationship between the complex dielectric permittivity, \u03b5 *=\u03b5\u2019\u2212i\u03b5\u201d and complex conductivity, \u03c3*=\u03c3\u2019+i\u03c3\u201d are expressed by the following equations, where, \u03c9 (= 2\u03c0f) is the angular frequency and f is the frequency. At lower frequencies, both \u03b5' and \u03b5'' increase with increasing filler volume fraction. The higher ceramic filler content leads to increased \u03b5' and \u03b5'' due to the space charge effect. Moreover, the NBT-0.6 CeO2 ceramic filler has a higher conductivity compared to the polymer matrix. As the volume fraction of this filler increases, its contribution to the overall conductivity of the composite also rises, leading to the observed increase in \u03b5''. The P(VDF-TrFE) composite was modeled by a two-phase dispersion system where phase 1 represents the polymer matrix; P(VDF-TrFE) and phase 2 is the ceramic fillers; NBT-0.6 CeO2. The effective dielectric constants of the polymer nanocomposite can be predicted from various theoretical models such as Furukawa , Clausius\u2212Mossotti , Maxwell and the effective medium theory (EMT). These models are strongly influenced by the size, shape and volume fraction of the fillers. presents the dielectric properties (measured at 1 kHz and room temperature) of P(VDF-TrFE) nanocomposites as a function of NBT-0.6CeO2 volume fraction. The Clausius\u2212Mossotti model which also assumes a simple binary composite, provides a reasonable fit at lower ceramic concentration (<0.05) but deviates from experimental data at higher concentrations. To account for the non-spherical morphology of BNT-0.6CeO2 particles (a), we also employed the Maxwell and effective medium theory (EMT) models. The EMT model incorporates a shape parameter, n. A value of n = 0 indicates a spherical particle, n = 1 represents a cylindrical particle, and n = 0.5 corresponds to a disc-shaped particle. Our experimental results were best described by the EMT model with n = 0.27, suggesting a non-spherical filler morphology which aligns with the observed square and rectangular shapes of BNT-0.6CeO2 particles in the FESEM images. The EMT model, considering the filler's shape, provides a more accurate representation of the composite's dielectric properties. Generally at the room temperature, two relaxation (\u03b1- and \u03b2-) processes observed in the P(VDF-TrFE) dielectric spectrum which are related to the crystalline motion. These relaxation processes were fitted using the Havriliak-Negami (HN) function : where \u03b5 \u221e is the instantaneous permittivity, \u2206\u03b5 is the dielectric strength, \u03c4 is the relaxation time, a and b are parameters describing the distribution of relaxation time and \u03c9 is the angular frequency. displays the observed and fitted spectra of \u03b5\u2032and\u03b5\u2033 of unpoled P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 composites across various volume fractions. A prominent \u03b2-relaxation peak, attributed to the crystalline chain segments of P(VDF-TrFE) was identified within the MHz frequency range at room temperature. Fitting the P(VDF-TrFE) data at room temperature yielded parameters: \u2206\u03b5 = 3.1, \u03c4 = 5.3 \xd710E^{\u22127} s, a =1, b = 0.81 for the \u03b2-relaxation. The intensity and peak position of this relaxation shifted towards higher frequencies with increasing temperature from 25\xb0C to 120\xb0C for both pure P(VDF-TrFE) and composite films. illustrates the resulting \u03b2-relaxation dielectric strength (\u2206\u03b5) and relaxation time (\u03c4) obtained from HN function fitting. The \u2206\u03b5of the \u03b2-relaxation initially increased with filler content up to 0.20 vol fraction, likely due to enhanced \u03b2-phase crystallinity induced by well-dispersed ceramic particles. However, further filler addition to 0.25 vol fraction led to a decrease in dielectric strength, attributed to filler aggregation, increased interfacial defects, and the formation of conductive pathways. In addition, the \u03c4 reduced with increasing filler concentration showing a similar trend, suggesting hindered polymer chain mobility at higher filler concentrations. The ferroelectric nature of NBT-0.6 CeO2 particles likely influences the relaxation behavior through interactions with the polymer's dipolar groups, potentially altering the trap level distribution within the composite films, as reported in. The P-E hysteresis behavior of P(VDF-TrFE) and P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 thin film composites at room temperature is shown in (a). The pure NBT-0.6 CeO2 ceramics exhibited a remanent polarization, P r of 560 mC/mE^{2} and a coercive field, E c of 5 MV/m, while the P(VDF-TrFE) polymer exhibited P r of 80 mC/mE^{2} and E c of 76 MV/m respectively. (b) shows the P r and E c of the samples with various volume fraction of ceramic fillers. Incorporating NBT-0.6 CeO2 ceramic as fillers has enhanced the remanent polarization and simultaneously reduced the coercive field in the composite system. When the volume fraction increased from 0 to 0.2, the remanent polarization was 166 mC/mE^{2} while reduced the coercive field from 76 MV/m to 55 MV/m compared with pure P(VDF-TrFE). However, adding more NBT-0.6 CeO2 above 0.2 vol fraction reduced the remanent polarization to 79 mC/mE^{2} even though the coercive field decreased. The enhancement of ferroelectric properties in P(VDF-TrFE) is governed by the conductivity in the series model. When the NBT-0.6 CeO2 increased to \u03d5 = 0.25, the pyroelectricity and ferroelectricity in the polymer phase were obscured by the direct current conduction in the parallel model. The internal fields, E and the electric displacements, D in the parallel model yields where subscripts 1 and 2 refer to matrix and fillers, respectively. When the electric field was applied during the polling process, the present of the NBT-0.6 CeO2 nanoparticles in the polymer matrix of P(VDF-TrFE) formed space charge layers at the interface between the ceramic and the polymer. The Maxwell\u2212Wagner\u2019s model considers the conductivity of the fillers of the composite thin film. Consequently, the space charges in the P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 nanocomposite can drift and accumulate at the boundary of the fillers and the polymer matrix interfaces at the faster rate to compensate for the discontinuity of the electric displacement at the location. The pyroelectric coefficient of the composite thin films with various volume fractions of NBT-0.6 CeO2 was plotted and shown in (b). The pyroelectric coefficients of the composite thin films increase proportionately with the increase of NBT-0.6 CeO2 volume fractions. The highest pyroelectric coefficient was obtained at \u03d5= 0.20 which is \u223c43 \u03bcC/mE^{2}K. This value is 34 % higher than the pure P(VDF-TrFE). Moreover, as observed in the ferroelectric result, we also see a similar trend with the pyroelectric coefficient of the samples with \u03d5= 0.25 where the pyroelectric coefficient is reduced to 35 \u03bcC/mE^{2}K. Since the value of \u03b5 2 is always found to be larger than \u03b5 1, thus, the local electric field applied on polymer matrix is much higher than the local electric field on the ceramic fillers. In addition, since the pyroelectric coefficient both NBT-0.6 CeO2 ceramic (650 \u03bcC/mE^{2}K) and the P(VDF-TrFE) (32 \u03bcC/mE^{2}K) have positive sign, thus, the ceramic and the copolymer phases in the P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 nanocomposite are poled in the same direction, consequently enhanced the pyroelectricity of the composite films. In the P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 nanocomposite, the formation of space charge layers at the interface is due to the presence of NBT-0.6 CeO2 ferroelectric nanoparticles. The nanoparticles\u2019 attraction causes copolymer molecules close to the nanoparticle interactive surface to become more mobile. This is due to the high ratio of free volume areas exhibited by nanoparticles (1000-fold higher compared to particles of micrometer size). In addition, the marked increase in the pyroelectric coefficient is attributed to the conductivity of the ceramic in the composite system, the phase structure of P(VDF-TrFE) and the promotion of non-homogeneous domain at lowered activation field in the absence of fillers. The higher volume fraction of NBT-0.6 CeO2 filler in a polymer matrix will contribute to higher d.c conduction in a nanocomposite. Thus, the optimum volume fraction of NBT-0.6 CeO2 dispersed in the polymer nanocomposite thin films should not be more than \u03d5= 0.20. shows the leakage current density versus electric field (J-E) plot of P(VDF-TrFE) and P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 thin film composites measured at room temperature. The leakage current density increases with the increase of electric field and saturated above 10 MV/m. From the graph, it is obvious that the leakage current increase from 10E^{\u22126} A/cm to 10E^{\u22123} A/cm with the increasing volume fraction of NBT-0.6 CeO2 ceramic from \u03d5 = 0.0 to \u03d5= 0.25. The leakage current in NBT-0.6 CeO2 is usually attributed to space charges, such as oxygen vacancies, which are induced by Bi volatilization during the sintering process and space charges between doping ion CeO2, and NBT with hole-carries. The piezoelectric constant, d 33, was measured for the bulk film (or free-standing film) of P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 composite at an optimized state for ferroelectric and pyroelectric properties. Only the optimized composite film with a volume fraction of 0.20, was the subject of investigation. The NBT-0.6 CeO2 ceramics exhibited a positive sign of d 33 = 90 pC/N, while the P(VDF-TrFE) polymer exhibited a negative sign of d 33 = \u221238 pC/N. The average of d 33 constant of 0.2 P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 was \u223c 49 pC/N. Thus, we have compared various P(VDF-TrFE) composites properties in the literature with our works as shown in. The piezoelectric constant and remanent polarization that we obtained from our work are i.e. d 33 = 49 pC/N and P r = 166 mC/mE^{2}, respectively. In addition, the poling field was also improved with the E c value of 55 MV/m at the low volume fraction, \u03d5 of 0.20. The observed piezoelectric constant and remanent polarization in our composite is notably high compared to literature values, especially considering the low volume fraction of 0.20. This suggests that the unique combination of NBT-0.6CeO2 and P(VDF-TrFE) in our composite effectively enhances the piezoelectric properties.

# INTRODUCTION
These properties make ferroelectrics highly sought-after for a variety of applications, including capacitors, dielectric resonators, sensors, transducers, actuators, and nonvolatile memories, optical waveguides, displays, and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) with miniature mechanical and electromechanical elements. Among the polymers, ferroelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and its copolymers with trifluoroethylene (P(VDF-TrFE)) stand out for their excellent balance of mechanical compliance, reasonable dielectric properties, and piezoelectric response. However, unlike most ferroelectric materials, PVDF and P(VDF-TrFE) exhibit negative piezoelectricity, meaning they contract upon application of an electric field in the polarization direction. This complex interplay between the polymer matrix and potential ceramic fillers presents a significant challenge in developing unified strategies to optimize the electromechanical properties of PVDF and P(VDF-TrFE) based composites. Ferroelectric ceramic fillers such as lead titanate (PT), lead zirconate titanate (PZT), lead magnesium niobate (PMN-PT), barium doped lead zirconate (BPZT) or barium titanate (BTO) embedded in the ferroelectric polymer matrix of PVDF and its copolymer P(VDF-TrFE) were reported for the past few decades to improve the electrical functional properties of the polymer composite films. The search for lead-free alternatives to traditional ferroelectric materials has led to extensive research on various perovskite-structured ferroelectrics (FEs). These include Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3 (NBT), BaTiO3 (BT), (K0.5Bi0.5)TiO3 (KBT), and (K,Na)NbO3 (KNN)-based solid solutions. Notably, NBT has emerged as a prominent candidate due to its exceptional properties in recent years, including giant field-induced strain, high stiffness, and remarkable fatigue resistance. However, despite these strengths, NBT exhibits drawbacks compared to lead-based counterparts: a diffuse phase transition, lower Curie temperature, and high electrical conductivity, leading to unwanted energy dissipation and hindered functionalities. To address these limitations, in our previous work, we explored the introduction of cerium oxide (CeO2) into the NBT crystal lattice, successfully altering and enhancing its properties. Building upon the prior research, this study investigates the potential of optimized NBT-0.6 mass % CeO2 ceramic fillers embedded in a P(VDF-TrFE) polymer matrix to enhance the composite's functional properties. The aim of the investigation was to study the impact of electroactive fillers (NBT-0.6 mass % CeO2) on the dielectric, ferroelectric and the piezoelectric properties of P(VDF-TrFE).

# CONCLUSION
This study presents a comprehensive investigation of a novel P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6CeO2 composite. By incorporating NBT-0.6CeO2 ceramic fillers, we significantly enhanced the composite's dielectric, ferroelectric, and pyroelectric properties. The optimal filler concentration was determined to be 0.2 vol fraction, resulting in substantial improvements in key performance metrics. The composite demonstrated a remarkable 110 % increase in remnant polarization, a 35 % increase in pyroelectric coefficient, and a piezoelectric constant of 49 pC/N. Theoretical models, including EMT, accurately described the composite's dielectric behavior. These findings highlight the potential of P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6CeO2 composites for applications in energy storage and intelligent piezoelectric systems.
