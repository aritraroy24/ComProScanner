Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'Solid state', 'precursors': ['Lead Zirconate Titanate disc'], 'steps': ['Coating with silver paste by screen printing', 'Firing at 800°C in air', 'DC magnetron sputtering of silver coating', 'Heating in flowing hydrogen gas at 700 °C for 2 h', 'Applying pressure of 20 MPa at 275°C or 400°C for 1 h', 'Thermal cycles between 250 °C and room temperature in air', 'Repoling in silicone oil at 150 °C with 15 kV DC potential for 15 min'], 'characterization_techniques': ['Ultrasonic C-scan imaging', 'Piezometer System', 'Ultrasonic immersion scanner', 'Transducer characterization system']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
