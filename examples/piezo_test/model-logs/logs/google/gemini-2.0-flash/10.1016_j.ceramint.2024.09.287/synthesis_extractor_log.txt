The 0.93 Pb(Zr1-xTix)O3-0.05 Pb(Mn1/3Sb2/3)O3-0.02 Pb(Sc1/2Nb1/2)O3 (PZT-PMS-PSN) perovskite ceramics with different Ti content (x = 0.48, 0.50, 0.52, 0.54 and 0.56) were synthesized using the traditional two-step solid-phase reaction method. The preparation process utilized high purity starting materials, including PbO (99.9 %), ZrO2 (99 %), TiO2 (99 %), MnO2 (99 %), Sb2O3 (99.9 %), Sc2O3 (99.99 %) and Nb2O5 (99.99 %), to ensure the utmost quality of the final product. The Sc2O3 and Nb2O5 powders were wet-mixed via ball milling for 12 h, followed by calcination at 1050 \xb0C for 6 h to obtain the precursor ScNbO4. Subsequently, the precursors were mixed with PbO, ZrO2, TiO2, MnO2, and Sb2O3 before being calcined at 850 \xb0C for 2 h to achieve the desired composition of PZT-PMS-PSN. Subsequently, the resultant powder was crushed for 8 h and then dried. The fine powder was mixed with the PVA binder at a mass concentration of 7 % and pressed to form \u03a610mm pellets at a pressure of 150 MPa. After the binder was cremated at 800 \xb0C for 2 h, the PZT-PMS-PSN samples were sintered at 1180 \xb0C for 2 h. Finally, the sintered pellets were polished to reach about 0.5 mm. For electrical property measurements, both sides of the sample were coated with silver paste and fired at 800 \xb0C for 10 min. The piezoelectric measurements required 30 min of polarization at 180 \xb0C in a silicone oil bath at a DC field strength of 5kv mmE^{\u22121}. The measurement of the piezoelectric coefficient d33 in the poled samples was conducted utilizing a ZJ-3AN/PM300 piezoelectric d33 m provided by the Institute of Acoustics, Academia Sinica, China. An X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out on the poled samples employing a third-generation Empyrean Diffractometer equipped with Ni-filtered Cu K\u03b1 line focused radiation operating at a power level of 1600W (40 kV, 40 mA). To obtain the Raman spectrum for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics, measurements were performed utilizing an advanced micro-Raman system apparatus known as LaRAM HR 800 developed by Horiba Jo. A comprehensive examination and analysis regarding the microstructure of the samples were carried out through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging techniques employing an advanced JSM6700F model manufactured by JEOL in Tokyo, Japan. In order to observe and analyze domain morphology, state-of-the-art piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) technique facilitated by an MFP-3D system developed by Asylum Research based in USA was utilized. The temperature dependence of the dielectric permittivity (\u03b5r) and dielectric loss tangent (tan\u03b4) was examined using an LCR meter (Model 4294A). Polarization-electric field (P-E) and strain-electric field (S-E) loops were measured at a frequency of 10 Hz utilizing an FE measurement system called Multiferroic 100 by Radiant Technology. Displacement measurements were conducted employing the Fotonic MTI-2100 sensor from MTI Instruments Inc. Impedance spectrum analysis was carried out utilizing the Agilent impedance analysis instrument Model 4294 A.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a\u2013e) illustrates the microstructural morphology of the sintered PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics, with the average grain size (AGS) indicated in the inserted figures. As depicted in (f), the mean grain size of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics is 6.53, 6.46, 6.78, 7.1, and 6.75 respectively. It is noteworthy that for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics with x = 0.52 and x = 0.54, the original morphology exhibits uniform characteristics and a more balanced distribution in both size and shape. Overall, these findings highlight the consistent microstructural features present within this range of compositions for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics. The XRD patterns of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics with different compositions (x = 0.48, 0.50, 0.52, 0.54, 0.56) at room temperature are depicted in. In the case of x = 0.48, the (111) peak displays a doublet while the (200) peak appears as a singlet, however, for x > 0.48, the (111) peak gracefully transforms into a singlet and the (200) peak elegantly splits into a doublet pattern. This indicates that there is a phase transition from rhombohedral (R) phase with space group R3m PDF#70\u20134072 to tetragonal (T) phase with space group P4mm PDF#89\u20136690. The (111) and (200) singlets of the x > 0.48 samples exhibit asymmetry due to the splitting of the 1/2{311} superlattice reflection, as observed in previous studies. Notably, this effect is more pronounced in the x = 0.48 sample, indicated by the black arrow. The splitting of superlattice peaks 1/2{311} comes from antiferrodistortive aE^{-}aE^{-}cE^{-} octahedra tilt along the [111]c axis in the Cc phase. The Rietveld refinement was conducted to accurately depict the evolution of phase structure in PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics, as illustrated in. summarizes the corresponding refined structural parameters. Throughout the refinement process, there is a remarkable agreement between the observed and calculated profiles for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics based on a single two-phase model: R3c + Cc and P4 mm + Cc. As depicted in (f), the calculated volume fraction of the Cc phase gradually increases from x = 0.48 (22.79 %) to approximately x = 0.52 (47.52 %), but eventually stabilizes at x = 0 0.56 (39 0.92 %). The presence of smooth polarization rotation within this Cc phase significantly contributes to its piezoelectric properties, indicating a transition from an R3c phase to a P4mm phase in the structure of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics. The refined profiles are consistent with XRD patterns for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics. The P4mm and R3c phase structures can be obtained from 5-atom unit cells (Z = 1) of the ideal cubic perovskite (Pm3m) by introducing different modes of structural distortion. Therefore, (a) shows the Raman spectra of the PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics to illustrate the R3c-P4mm transition. The frequency of some modes decreased, such as 210.15 cmE^{\u22121} and 549.39 cmE^{\u22121}. However, some modes disappear, such as 241.56 cmE^{\u22121} and 579.51 cmE^{\u22121}. When x increases to 0.56, these modes clearly split neatly, becoming 564.92 cmE^{\u22121} and 592.64 cmE^{\u22121}. The dominant modes in the vicinity of A1(TO1) \u2212130 cmE^{\u22121} primarily correspond to antiferrodistorsive (AFD) modes. It can be found that as x increases, the strength of A1(TO1) increases. It indicates that the AFD distortion is becoming stronger, which is caused by the increase of the Cc phase. The mode around E(TO2)-R- 241.562 cmE^{\u22121} is related to the O-Zr-O bending. The mode near E(TO2)-R - 241.562 cmE^{\u22121} is related to the O-Zr-O bending, which is the characteristic mode of R3c and disappears with the increase of x. Secondly, the peak near E(TO3) + A1(3TO)-R - 579.51 cmE^{\u22121} is also the characteristic peak of the R3c phase. With the increase of x, the peak width gradually disappears and split into A1(3TO) and E(TO3). All these indicate that the structure of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics changes from R3c to P4mm phase. The PFM measurements were conducted within an 8 \u03bcm \u2217 8 \u03bcm rectangular region to illustrate the alterations in domain structure of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics, as depicted in (a\u2013i). The polarization axis of the rhombohedral phase aligns parallel to [111], resulting in eight potential domain orientations and the formation of 71\xb0, 180\xb0, and 109\xb0 domain structures. The 71\xb0 and 109\xb0 domain are characterized by the wedge-shaped domain which is shown in the blue oval and arrow in (b) in rhombohedral PZT-PMS-PSN ceramic. The 180\xb0 domain is characterized by the lamellar domain that is marked as the pink oval and arrow in (b). Different from rhombohedral phase, the polarization axis of the tetragonal phase is aligned parallel to [001], resulting in six potential domain orientations, which give rise to 90\xb0 and 180\xb0 domain structures. The 90\xb0 domain are characterized by the herringbone-like domain which is shown in the green oval and arrow in (e) in tetragonal PZT-PMS-PSN ceramic. The variation trend of the dielectric constant (\u03b5r) and dielectric loss of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics at different temperatures is illustrated in (a\u2013e), with x content ranging from 0.48 to 0.56 and a frequency range of 0.1\u2013100 kHz. It can be seen from (f) that with the increase of x, the Curie temperature increases, and the temperature is 309, 315, 328.1, 333.1 and 335.1 respectively, which is conducive to the improvement of the stability of temperature. In order to find out the effect of x addition on the ferroelectric performance of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics, the polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loops of unpoled PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics at room temperature and 10 Hz are shown in (a\u2013b). The saturated polarization (P max), remnant polarization (P r ) and coercive field (E c\u2212, E c+) associated with the composition are illustrated in (c\u2013d). The E c+ first increases and then slightly decreases with the increase of x addition, which means enhancing the \u201csoft\u201d effect and stabilizing the \u201chard\u201d effect for piezoelectric materials. And the Ei decreases with the increase of x addition, which demonstrates that \u201chard\u201d effect is stable. generated the defect dipole (PD) and form an internal field (Ei) that provides a restoring force for the spontaneously polarized Ps. The hysteresis loop of the polarization-electric field (P-E) for poled PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics at room temperature and 10 Hz is depicted in (e), while the corresponding internal bias field Ei is illustrated in (f). It can be observed that the internal bias field of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics increases as the phase structure transitions from R3c to P4mm, which is caused that the alignment of the defect oxygen vacancy symmetry with the tetragonal phase is facilitated. (a) displays the frequency dependence of impedance |Z| for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics of x = 0.48, 0.52, and 0.56 in 33 mode. It can be observed that the maximum phase angle a close approximation to 90\xb0, manifesting that the polarization reversal is fully saturated and the electrical properties are hardly related to the polarization conditions. The d33 and Qm values of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics exhibit variations with the x content, as illustrated in (b). The d33 of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics is 214, 265, 315, 225, and 156 respectively. The d33 of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics exhibits an initial increase followed by a decrease as x increases, reaching its maximum value of 315 at x = 0.52. This behavior can be attributed to the increased presence of the C1c2 phase, which leads to a reduction in Gibbs free energy difference and enhances polarization rotation diversity. Simultaneously, the easier movement of domain walls results in a decreased mechanical quality factor for the material. (c) shows the \u03b5r and tan\u03b4 of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics. The loss values are 0.224, 0.279, 0.290, 0.391, and 0.281, respectively. And the \u03b5r are 611, 966, 1126, 926 and 796, respectively. It can be observed that the tan\u03b4 and \u03b5r increases with the increase of x, and then decreases, which is mainly related to C1c2 structure that allows the polar axis to lie anywhere between the [001] and the [111] axes. The kp and g33 of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics are displayed in (d), The value of g33 decreases as x increases, while kp remains relatively stable for values of x below 0.54. (a) shows the bipolar strain versus electric field S-E loops of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics at room temperature and 10 Hz. Furthermore, the corresponding composition-dependent negative, positive, and total strain for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics are shown in (b). Specifically, The positive strain of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics is 0.14 %, 0.19 %, 0.16 %, 0.12 %, and 0.13 %, respectively. Consequently, an enhanced strain was observed in the PZT-PMS-PSN ceramic of x = 0.50 and 0.52 near the MPB. And the PZT-PMS-PSN ceramic of x = 0.52 demonstrates exceptional piezoelectric properties and a low dielectric loss coefficient, with high d33 = 315 pC NE^{\u22121} and Qm = 1578, as well as low \u03b5r = 1160, tan\u03b4 = 0.288 %. summarizes some important properties for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramic of x = 0.52 and other hard piezoelectric materials for high-power applications. It can be found that the PZT-PMS-PSN ceramic of x = 0.52 has high Tc and low tan\u03b4. The subsequent analysis delves into the fundamental physical mechanism of piezoelectricity for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramic of x = 0.52. Rayleigh analysis enables a quantitative assessment of these intrinsic and extrinsic contributions, as demonstrated in the subsequent equation :  The polarizability P(E) is determined by the amplitude (E0) of the applied electric field. To prevent the nucleation of new domains, E0 was maintained below half of the coercive field EC. \u03b5init represents the reversible permittivity coefficient. The Rayleigh coefficient \u03b1 represents the piezoelectric external response, which can be interpreted as an irreversible displacement of the domain wall, calculated from the slope of \u03b5\u2217 with respect to E0. (a) displays a typical hysteresis loop for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramic of x = 0.52. The reverse permittivity coefficient \u03b5\u2217 is obtained by measuring the peak-to-peak polarization (Pp-p) at each electric field (E0) using the Rayleigh method, following these steps:  The field correlation values of \u03b5\u2217 obtained from are subjected to linear fitting, and the corresponding results are presented in (b). The values of \u03b5init and \u03b1 are illustrated in (c). It is noteworthy that at x = 0.52, both the \u03b5init and \u03b1 values exhibit a consistent trend and reach their maximum, indicating an amplification of intrinsic and external contributions, thereby resulting in an enhanced piezoelectric effect. The extrinsic contribution to the total dielectric response (\u03b1E0/(\u03b1E0 + \u03b5init)) is 9.3 % at x = 0.48, and decreases to 6.6 % at x = 0.52, indicating that the influence of inelastic domain wall motion on d33 is minimal.

The 0.93 Pb(Zr1-xTix)O3-0.05 Pb(Mn1/3Sb2/3)O3-0.02 Pb(Sc1/2Nb1/2)O3 (PZT-PMS-PSN) perovskite ceramics with different Ti content (x = 0.48, 0.50, 0.52, 0.54 and 0.56) were synthesized using the traditional two-step solid-phase reaction method.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a\u2013e) illustrates the microstructural morphology of the sintered PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics, with the average grain size (AGS) indicated in the inserted figures.

Notably, this effect is more pronounced in the x = 0.48 sample, indicated by the black arrow. The splitting of superlattice peaks 1/2{311} comes from antiferrodistortive aE^{-}aE^{-}cE^{-} octahedra tilt along the [111]c axis in the Cc phase. The Rietveld refinement was conducted to accurately depict the evolution of phase structure in PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics, as illustrated in. summarizes the corresponding refined structural parameters. Throughout the refinement process, there is a remarkable agreement between the observed and calculated profiles for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics based on a single two-phase model: R3c + Cc and P4 mm + Cc. As depicted in (f), the calculated volume fraction of the Cc phase gradually increases from x = 0.48 (22.79 %) to approximately x = 0.52 (47.52 %), but eventually stabilizes at x = 0 0.56 (39 0.92 %). The presence of smooth polarization rotation within this Cc phase significantly contributes to its piezoelectric properties, indicating a transition from an R3c phase to a P4mm phase in the structure of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics. The refined profiles are consistent with XRD patterns for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics. The P4mm and R3c phase structures can be obtained from 5-atom unit cells (Z = 1) of the ideal cubic perovskite (Pm3m) by introducing different modes of structural distortion. Therefore, (a) shows the Raman spectra of the PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics to illustrate the R3c-P4mm transition. The frequency of some modes decreased, such as 210.15 cmE^{\u22121} and 549.39 cmE^{\u22121}. However, some modes disappear, such as 241.56 cmE^{\u22121} and 579.51 cmE^{\u22121}. When x increases to 0.56, these modes clearly split neatly, becoming 564.92 cmE^{\u22121} and 592.64 cmE^{\u22121}. The dominant modes in the vicinity of A1(TO1) \u2212130 cmE^{\u22121} primarily correspond to antiferrodistorsive (AFD) modes. It can be found that as x increases, the strength of A1(TO1) increases. It indicates that the AFD distortion is becoming stronger, which is caused by the increase of the Cc phase. The mode around E(TO2)-R- 241.562 cmE^{\u22121} is related to the O-Zr-O bending. The mode near E(TO2)-R - 241.562 cmE^{\u22121} is related to the O-Zr-O bending, which is the characteristic mode of R3c and disappears with the increase of x. Secondly, the peak near E(TO3) + A1(3TO)-R - 579.51 cmE^{\u22121} is also the characteristic peak of the R3c phase. With the increase of x, the peak width gradually disappears and split into A1(3TO) and E(TO3). All these indicate that the structure of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics changes from R3c to P4mm phase. The PFM measurements were conducted within an 8 \u03bcm \u2217 8 \u03bcm rectangular region to illustrate the alterations in domain structure of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics, as depicted in (a\u2013i). The polarization axis of the rhombohedral phase aligns parallel to [111], resulting in eight potential domain orientations and the formation of 71\xb0, 180\xb0, and 109\xb0 domain structures. The 71\xb0 and 109\xb0 domain are characterized by the wedge-shaped domain which is shown in the blue oval and arrow in (b) in rhombohedral PZT-PMS-PSN ceramic. The 180\xb0 domain is characterized by the lamellar domain that is marked as the pink oval and arrow in (b). Different from rhombohedral phase, the polarization axis of the tetragonal phase is aligned parallel to [001], resulting in six potential domain orientations, which give rise to 90\xb0 and 180\xb0 domain structures. The 90\xb0 domain are characterized by the herringbone-like domain which is shown in the green oval and arrow in (e) in tetragonal PZT-PMS-PSN ceramic. The variation trend of the dielectric constant (\u03b5r) and dielectric loss of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics at different temperatures is illustrated in (a\u2013e), with x content ranging from 0.48 to 0.56 and a frequency range of 0.1\u2013100 kHz. It can be seen from (f) that with the increase of x, the Curie temperature increases, and the temperature is 309, 315, 328.1, 333.1 and 335.1 respectively, which is conducive to the improvement of the stability of temperature. In order to find out the effect of x addition on the ferroelectric performance of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics, the polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loops of unpoled PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics at room temperature and 10 Hz are shown in (a\u2013b). The saturated polarization (P max), remnant polarization (P r ) and coercive field (E c\u2212, E c+) associated with the composition are illustrated in (c\u2013d). The E c+ first increases and then slightly decreases with the increase of x addition, which means enhancing the \u201csoft\u201d effect and stabilizing the \u201chard\u201d effect for piezoelectric materials. And the Ei decreases with the increase of x addition, which demonstrates that \u201chard\u201d effect is stable. generated the defect dipole (PD) and form an internal field (Ei) that provides a restoring force for the spontaneously polarized Ps. The hysteresis loop of the polarization-electric field (P-E) for poled PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics at room temperature and 10 Hz is depicted in (e), while the corresponding internal bias field Ei is illustrated in (f). It can be observed that the internal bias field of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics increases as the phase structure transitions from R3c to P4mm, which is caused that the alignment of the defect oxygen vacancy symmetry with the tetragonal phase is facilitated. (a) displays the frequency dependence of impedance |Z| for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics of x = 0.48, 0.52, and 0.56 in 33 mode. It can be observed that the maximum phase angle a close approximation to 90\xb0, manifesting that the polarization reversal is fully saturated and the electrical properties are hardly related to the polarization conditions. The d33 and Qm values of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics exhibit variations with the x content, as illustrated in (b). The d33 of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics is 214, 265, 315, 225, and 156 respectively. The d33 of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics exhibits an initial increase followed by a decrease as x increases, reaching its maximum value of 315 at x = 0.52. This behavior can be attributed to the increased presence of the C1c2 phase, which leads to a reduction in Gibbs free energy difference and enhances polarization rotation diversity. Simultaneously, the easier movement of domain walls results in a decreased mechanical quality factor for the material. (c) shows the \u03b5r and tan\u03b4 of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics. The loss values are 0.224, 0.279, 0.290, 0.391, and 0.281, respectively. And the \u03b5r are 611, 966, 1126, 926 and 796, respectively. It can be observed that the tan\u03b4 and \u03b5r increases with the increase of x, and then decreases, which is mainly related to C1c2 structure that allows the polar axis to lie anywhere between the [001] and the [111] axes. The kp and g33 of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics are displayed in (d), The value of g33 decreases as x increases, while kp remains relatively stable for values of x below 0.54. (a) shows the bipolar strain versus electric field S-E loops of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics at room temperature and 10 Hz. Furthermore, the corresponding composition-dependent negative, positive, and total strain for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics are shown in (b). Specifically, The positive strain of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics is 0.14 %, 0.19 %, 0.16 %, 0.12 %, and 0.13 %, respectively. Consequently, an enhanced strain was observed in the PZT-PMS-PSN ceramic of x = 0.50 and 0.52 near the MPB. And the PZT-PMS-PSN ceramic of x = 0.52 demonstrates exceptional piezoelectric properties and a low dielectric loss coefficient, with high d33 = 315 pC NE^{\u22121} and Qm = 1578, as well as low \u03b5r = 1160, tan\u03b4 = 0.288 %. summarizes some important properties for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramic of x = 0.52 and other hard piezoelectric materials for high-power applications. It can be found that the PZT-PMS-PSN ceramic of x = 0.52 has high Tc and low tan\u03b4. The subsequent analysis delves into the fundamental physical mechanism of piezoelectricity for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramic of x = 0.52. Rayleigh analysis enables a quantitative assessment of these intrinsic and extrinsic contributions, as demonstrated in the subsequent equation :  The polarizability P(E) is determined by the amplitude (E0) of the applied electric field. To prevent the nucleation of new domains, E0 was maintained below half of the coercive field EC. \u03b5init represents the reversible permittivity coefficient. The Rayleigh coefficient \u03b1 represents the piezoelectric external response, which can be interpreted as an irreversible displacement of the domain wall, calculated from the slope of \u03b5\u2217 with respect to E0. (a) displays a typical hysteresis loop for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramic of x = 0.52. The reverse permittivity coefficient \u03b5\u2217 is obtained by measuring the peak-to-peak polarization (Pp-p) at each electric field (E0) using the Rayleigh method, following these steps:  The field correlation values of \u03b5\u2217 obtained from are subjected to linear fitting, and the corresponding results are presented in (b). The values of \u03b5init and \u03b1 are illustrated in (c). It is noteworthy that at x = 0.52, both the \u03b5init and \u03b1 values exhibit a consistent trend and reach their maximum, indicating an amplification of intrinsic and external contributions, thereby resulting in an enhanced piezoelectric effect. The extrinsic contribution to the total dielectric response (\u03b1E0/(\u03b1E0 + \u03b5init)) is 9.3 % at x = 0.48, and decreases to 6.6 % at x = 0.52, indicating that the influence of inelastic domain wall motion on d33 is minimal.

The 0.93 Pb(Zr1-xTix)O3-0.05 Pb(Mn1/3Sb2/3)O3-0.02 Pb(Sc1/2Nb1/2)O3 (PZT-PMS-PSN) perovskite ceramics with different Ti content (x = 0.48, 0.50, 0.52, 0.54 and 0.56) were synthesized using the traditional two-step solid-phase reaction method. The preparation process utilized high purity starting materials, including PbO (99.9 %), ZrO2 (99 %), TiO2 (99 %), MnO2 (99 %), Sb2O3 (99.9 %), Sc2O3 (99.99 %) and Nb2O5 (99.99 %), to ensure the utmost quality of the final product. The Sc2O3 and Nb2O5 powders were wet-mixed via ball milling for 12 h, followed by calcination at 1050 \xb0C for 6 h to obtain the precursor ScNbO4. Subsequently, the precursors were mixed with PbO, ZrO2, TiO2, MnO2, and Sb2O3 before being calcined at 850 \xb0C for 2 h to achieve the desired composition of PZT-PMS-PSN. Subsequently, the resultant powder was crushed for 8 h and then dried. The fine powder was mixed with the PVA binder at a mass concentration of 7 % and pressed to form \u03a610mm pellets at a pressure of 150 MPa. After the binder was cremated at 800 \xb0C for 2 h, the PZT-PMS-PSN samples were sintered at 1180 \xb0C for 2 h. Finally, the sintered pellets were polished to reach about 0.5 mm. For electrical property measurements, both sides of the sample were coated with silver paste and fired at 800 \xb0C for 10 min. The piezoelectric measurements required 30 min of polarization at 180 \xb0C in a silicone oil bath at a DC field strength of 5kv mmE^{\u22121}. The measurement of the piezoelectric coefficient d33 in the poled samples was conducted utilizing a ZJ-3AN/PM300 piezoelectric d33 m provided by the Institute of Acoustics, Academia Sinica, China. An X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out on the poled samples employing a third-generation Empyrean Diffractometer equipped with Ni-filtered Cu K\u03b1 line focused radiation operating at a power level of 1600W (40 kV, 40 mA). To obtain the Raman spectrum for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics, measurements were performed utilizing an advanced micro-Raman system apparatus known as LaRAM HR 800 developed by Horiba Jo. A comprehensive examination and analysis regarding the microstructure of the samples were carried out through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging techniques employing an advanced JSM6700F model manufactured by JEOL in Tokyo, Japan. In order to observe and analyze domain morphology, state-of-the-art piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) technique facilitated by an MFP-3D system developed by Asylum Research based in USA was utilized. The temperature dependence of the dielectric permittivity (\u03b5r) and dielectric loss tangent (tan\u03b4) was examined using an LCR meter (Model 4294A). Polarization-electric field (P-E) and strain-electric field (S-E) loops were measured at a frequency of 10 Hz utilizing an FE measurement system called Multiferroic 100 by Radiant Technology. Displacement measurements were conducted employing the Fotonic MTI-2100 sensor from MTI Instruments Inc. Impedance spectrum analysis was carried out utilizing the Agilent impedance analysis instrument Model 4294 A.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a\u2013e) illustrates the microstructural morphology of the sintered PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics, with the average grain size (AGS) indicated in the inserted figures. As depicted in (f), the mean grain size of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics is 6.53, 6.46, 6.78, 7.1, and 6.75 respectively. It is noteworthy that for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics with x = 0.52 and x = 0.54, the original morphology exhibits uniform characteristics and a more balanced distribution in both size and shape. Overall, these findings highlight the consistent microstructural features present within this range of compositions for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics. The XRD patterns of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics with different compositions (x = 0.48, 0.50, 0.52, 0.54, 0.56) at room temperature are depicted in. In the case of x = 0.48, the (111) peak displays a doublet while the (200) peak appears as a singlet, however, for x > 0.48, the (111) peak gracefully transforms into a singlet and the (200) peak elegantly splits into a doublet pattern. This indicates that there is a phase transition from rhombohedral (R) phase with space group R3m PDF#70\u20134072 to tetragonal (T) phase with space group P4mm PDF#89\u20136690. The (111) and (200) singlets of the x > 0.48 samples exhibit asymmetry due to the splitting of the 1/2{311} superlattice reflection, as observed in previous studies. Notably, this effect is more pronounced in the x = 0.48 sample, indicated by the black arrow. The splitting of superlattice peaks 1/2{311} comes from antiferrodistortive aE^{-}aE^{-}cE^{-} octahedra tilt along the [111]c axis in the Cc phase. The Rietveld refinement was conducted to accurately depict the evolution of phase structure in PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics, as illustrated in. summarizes the corresponding refined structural parameters. Throughout the refinement process, there is a remarkable agreement between the observed and calculated profiles for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics based on a single two-phase model: R3c + Cc and P4 mm + Cc. As depicted in (f), the calculated volume fraction of the Cc phase gradually increases from x = 0.48 (22.79 %) to approximately x = 0.52 (47.52 %), but eventually stabilizes at x = 0 0.56 (39 0.92 %). The presence of smooth polarization rotation within this Cc phase significantly contributes to its piezoelectric properties, indicating a transition from an R3c phase to a P4mm phase in the structure of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics. The refined profiles are consistent with XRD patterns for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics. The P4mm and R3c phase structures can be obtained from 5-atom unit cells (Z = 1) of the ideal cubic perovskite (Pm3m) by introducing different modes of structural distortion. Therefore, (a) shows the Raman spectra of the PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics to illustrate the R3c-P4mm transition. The frequency of some modes decreased, such as 210.15 cmE^{\u22121} and 549.39 cmE^{\u22121}. However, some modes disappear, such as 241.56 cmE^{\u22121} and 579.51 cmE^{\u22121}. When x increases to 0.56, these modes clearly split neatly, becoming 564.92 cmE^{\u22121} and 592.64 cmE^{\u22121}. The dominant modes in the vicinity of A1(TO1) \u2212130 cmE^{\u22121} primarily correspond to antiferrodistorsive (AFD) modes. It can be found that as x increases, the strength of A1(TO1) increases. It indicates that the AFD distortion is becoming stronger, which is caused by the increase of the Cc phase. The mode around E(TO2)-R- 241.562 cmE^{\u22121} is related to the O-Zr-O bending. The mode near E(TO2)-R - 241.562 cmE^{\u22121} is related to the O-Zr-O bending, which is the characteristic mode of R3c and disappears with the increase of x. Secondly, the peak near E(TO3) + A1(3TO)-R - 579.51 cmE^{\u22121} is also the characteristic peak of the R3c phase. With the increase of x, the peak width gradually disappears and split into A1(3TO) and E(TO3). All these indicate that the structure of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics changes from R3c to P4mm phase. The PFM measurements were conducted within an 8 \u03bcm \u2217 8 \u03bcm rectangular region to illustrate the alterations in domain structure of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics, as depicted in (a\u2013i). The polarization axis of the rhombohedral phase aligns parallel to [111], resulting in eight potential domain orientations and the formation of 71\xb0, 180\xb0, and 109\xb0 domain structures. The 71\xb0 and 109\xb0 domain are characterized by the wedge-shaped domain which is shown in the blue oval and arrow in (b) in rhombohedral PZT-PMS-PSN ceramic. The 180\xb0 domain is characterized by the lamellar domain that is marked as the pink oval and arrow in (b). Different from rhombohedral phase, the polarization axis of the tetragonal phase is aligned parallel to [001], resulting in six potential domain orientations, which give rise to 90\xb0 and 180\xb0 domain structures. The 90\xb0 domain are characterized by the herringbone-like domain which is shown in the green oval and arrow in (e) in tetragonal PZT-PMS-PSN ceramic. The variation trend of the dielectric constant (\u03b5r) and dielectric loss of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics at different temperatures is illustrated in (a\u2013e), with x content ranging from 0.48 to 0.56 and a frequency range of 0.1\u2013100 kHz. It can be seen from (f) that with the increase of x, the Curie temperature increases, and the temperature is 309, 315, 328.1, 333.1 and 335.1 respectively, which is conducive to the improvement of the stability of temperature. In order to find out the effect of x addition on the ferroelectric performance of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics, the polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loops of unpoled PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics at room temperature and 10 Hz are shown in (a\u2013b). The saturated polarization (P max), remnant polarization (P r ) and coercive field (E c\u2212, E c+) associated with the composition are illustrated in (c\u2013d). The E c+ first increases and then slightly decreases with the increase of x addition, which means enhancing the \u201csoft\u201d effect and stabilizing the \u201chard\u201d effect for piezoelectric materials. And the Ei decreases with the increase of x addition, which demonstrates that \u201chard\u201d effect is stable. generated the defect dipole (PD) and form an internal field (Ei) that provides a restoring force for the spontaneously polarized Ps. The hysteresis loop of the polarization-electric field (P-E) for poled PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics at room temperature and 10 Hz is depicted in (e), while the corresponding internal bias field Ei is illustrated in (f). It can be observed that the internal bias field of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics increases as the phase structure transitions from R3c to P4mm, which is caused that the alignment of the defect oxygen vacancy symmetry with the tetragonal phase is facilitated. (a) displays the frequency dependence of impedance |Z| for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics of x = 0.48, 0.52, and 0.56 in 33 mode. It can be observed that the maximum phase angle a close approximation to 90\xb0, manifesting that the polarization reversal is fully saturated and the electrical properties are hardly related to the polarization conditions. The d33 and Qm values of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics exhibit variations with the x content, as illustrated in (b). The d33 of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics is 214, 265, 315, 225, and 156 respectively. The d33 of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics exhibits an initial increase followed by a decrease as x increases, reaching its maximum value of 315 at x = 0.52. This behavior can be attributed to the increased presence of the C1c2 phase, which leads to a reduction in Gibbs free energy difference and enhances polarization rotation diversity. Simultaneously, the easier movement of domain walls results in a decreased mechanical quality factor for the material. (c) shows the \u03b5r and tan\u03b4 of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics. The loss values are 0.224, 0.279, 0.290, 0.391, and 0.281, respectively. And the \u03b5r are 611, 966, 1126, 926 and 796, respectively. It can be observed that the tan\u03b4 and \u03b5r increases with the increase of x, and then decreases, which is mainly related to C1c2 structure that allows the polar axis to lie anywhere between the [001] and the [111] axes. The kp and g33 of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics are displayed in (d), The value of g33 decreases as x increases, while kp remains relatively stable for values of x below 0.54. (a) shows the bipolar strain versus electric field S-E loops of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics at room temperature and 10 Hz. Furthermore, the corresponding composition-dependent negative, positive, and total strain for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics are shown in (b). Specifically, The positive strain of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics is 0.14 %, 0.19 %, 0.16 %, 0.12 %, and 0.13 %, respectively. Consequently, an enhanced strain was observed in the PZT-PMS-PSN ceramic of x = 0.50 and 0.52 near the MPB. And the PZT-PMS-PSN ceramic of x = 0.52 demonstrates exceptional piezoelectric properties and a low dielectric loss coefficient, with high d33 = 315 pC NE^{\u22121} and Qm = 1578, as well as low \u03b5r = 1160, tan\u03b4 = 0.288 %. summarizes some important properties for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramic of x = 0.52 and other hard piezoelectric materials for high-power applications. It can be found that the PZT-PMS-PSN ceramic of x = 0.52 has high Tc and low tan\u03b4. The subsequent analysis delves into the fundamental physical mechanism of piezoelectricity for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramic of x = 0.52. Rayleigh analysis enables a quantitative assessment of these intrinsic and extrinsic contributions, as demonstrated in the subsequent equation :  The polarizability P(E) is determined by the amplitude (E0) of the applied electric field. To prevent the nucleation of new domains, E0 was maintained below half of the coercive field EC. \u03b5init represents the reversible permittivity coefficient. The Rayleigh coefficient \u03b1 represents the piezoelectric external response, which can be interpreted as an irreversible displacement of the domain wall, calculated from the slope of \u03b5\u2217 with respect to E0. (a) displays a typical hysteresis loop for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramic of x = 0.52. The reverse permittivity coefficient \u03b5\u2217 is obtained by measuring the peak-to-peak polarization (Pp-p) at each electric field (E0) using the Rayleigh method, following these steps:  The field correlation values of \u03b5\u2217 obtained from are subjected to linear fitting, and the corresponding results are presented in (b). The values of \u03b5init and \u03b1 are illustrated in (c). It is noteworthy that at x = 0.52, both the \u03b5init and \u03b1 values exhibit a consistent trend and reach their maximum, indicating an amplification of intrinsic and external contributions, thereby resulting in an enhanced piezoelectric effect. The extrinsic contribution to the total dielectric response (\u03b1E0/(\u03b1E0 + \u03b5init)) is 9.3 % at x = 0.48, and decreases to 6.6 % at x = 0.52, indicating that the influence of inelastic domain wall motion on d33 is minimal.

The 0.93 Pb(Zr1-xTix)O3-0.05 Pb(Mn1/3Sb2/3)O3-0.02 Pb(Sc1/2Nb1/2)O3 (PZT-PMS-PSN) perovskite ceramics with different Ti content (x = 0.48, 0.50, 0.52, 0.54 and 0.56) were synthesized using the traditional two-step solid-phase reaction method. The preparation process utilized high purity starting materials, including PbO (99.9 %), ZrO2 (99 %), TiO2 (99 %), MnO2 (99 %), Sb2O3 (99.9 %), Sc2O3 (99.99 %) and Nb2O5 (99.99 %), to ensure the utmost quality of the final product. The Sc2O3 and Nb2O5 powders were wet-mixed via ball milling for 12 h, followed by calcination at 1050 \xb0C for 6 h to obtain the precursor ScNbO4. Subsequently, the precursors were mixed with PbO, ZrO2, TiO2, MnO2, and Sb2O3 before being calcined at 850 \xb0C for 2 h to achieve the desired composition of PZT-PMS-PSN. Subsequently, the resultant powder was crushed for 8 h and then dried. The fine powder was mixed with the PVA binder at a mass concentration of 7 % and pressed to form \u03a610mm pellets at a pressure of 150 MPa. After the binder was cremated at 800 \xb0C for 2 h, the PZT-PMS-PSN samples were sintered at 1180 \xb0C for 2 h. Finally, the sintered pellets were polished to reach about 0.5 mm. For electrical property measurements, both sides of the sample were coated with silver paste and fired at 800 \xb0C for 10 min. The piezoelectric measurements required 30 min of polarization at 180 \xb0C in a silicone oil bath at a DC field strength of 5kv mmE^{\u22121}. The measurement of the piezoelectric coefficient d33 in the poled samples was conducted utilizing a ZJ-3AN/PM300 piezoelectric d33 m provided by the Institute of Acoustics, Academia Sinica, China. An X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out on the poled samples employing a third-generation Empyrean Diffractometer equipped with Ni-filtered Cu K\u03b1 line focused radiation operating at a power level of 1600W (40 kV, 40 mA). To obtain the Raman spectrum for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics, measurements were performed utilizing an advanced micro-Raman system apparatus known as LaRAM HR 800 developed by Horiba Jo. A comprehensive examination and analysis regarding the microstructure of the samples were carried out through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging techniques employing an advanced JSM6700F model manufactured by JEOL in Tokyo, Japan. In order to observe and analyze domain morphology, state-of-the-art piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) technique facilitated by an MFP-3D system developed by Asylum Research based in USA was utilized. The temperature dependence of the dielectric permittivity (\u03b5r) and dielectric loss tangent (tan\u03b4) was examined using an LCR meter (Model 4294A). Polarization-electric field (P-E) and strain-electric field (S-E) loops were measured at a frequency of 10 Hz utilizing an FE measurement system called Multiferroic 100 by Radiant Technology. Displacement measurements were conducted employing the Fotonic MTI-2100 sensor from MTI Instruments Inc.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a\u2013e) illustrates the microstructural morphology of the sintered PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics, with the average grain size (AGS) indicated in the inserted figures. As depicted in (f), the mean grain size of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics is 6.53, 6.46, 6.78, 7.1, and 6.75 respectively. It is noteworthy that for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics with x = 0.52 and x = 0.54, the original morphology exhibits uniform characteristics and a more balanced distribution in both size and shape. Overall, these findings highlight the consistent microstructural features present within this range of compositions for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics. The XRD patterns of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics with different compositions (x = 0.48, 0.50, 0.52, 0.54, 0.56) at room temperature are depicted in. In the case of x = 0.48, the (111) peak displays a doublet while the (200) peak appears as a singlet, however, for x > 0.48, the (111) peak gracefully transforms into a singlet and the (200) peak elegantly splits into a doublet pattern. This indicates that there is a phase transition from rhombohedral (R) phase with space group R3m PDF#70\u20134072 to tetragonal (T) phase with space group P4mm PDF#89\u20136690. The (111) and (200) singlets of the x > 0.48 samples exhibit asymmetry due to the splitting of the 1/2{311} superlattice reflection, as observed in previous studies. Notably, this effect is more pronounced in the x = 0.48 sample, indicated by the black arrow. The splitting of superlattice peaks 1/2{311} comes from antiferrodistortive aE^{-}aE^{-}cE^{-} octahedra tilt along the [111]c axis in the Cc phase. The Rietveld refinement was conducted to accurately depict the evolution of phase structure in PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics, as illustrated in. summarizes the corresponding refined structural parameters. Throughout the refinement process, there is a remarkable agreement between the observed and calculated profiles for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics based on a single two-phase model: R3c + Cc and P4 mm + Cc. As depicted in (f), the calculated volume fraction of the Cc phase gradually increases from x = 0.48 (22.79 %) to approximately x = 0.52 (47.52 %), but eventually stabilizes at x = 0 0.56 (39 0.92 %). The presence of smooth polarization rotation within this Cc phase significantly contributes to its piezoelectric properties, indicating a transition from an R3c phase to a P4mm phase in the structure of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics. The refined profiles are consistent with XRD patterns for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics. The P4mm and R3c phase structures can be obtained from 5-atom unit cells (Z = 1) of the ideal cubic perovskite (Pm3m) by introducing different modes of structural distortion. Therefore, (a) shows the Raman spectra of the PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics to illustrate the R3c-P4mm transition. The frequency of some modes decreased, such as 210.15 cmE^{\u22121} and 549.39 cmE^{\u22121}. However, some modes disappear, such as 241.56 cmE^{\u22121} and 579.51 cmE^{\u22121}. When x increases to 0.56, these modes clearly split neatly, becoming 564.92 cmE^{\u22121} and 592.64 cmE^{\u22121}. The dominant modes in the vicinity of A1(TO1) \u2212130 cmE^{\u22121} primarily correspond to antiferrodistorsive (AFD) modes. It can be found that as x increases, the strength of A1(TO1) increases. It indicates that the AFD distortion is becoming stronger, which is caused by the increase of the Cc phase. The mode around E(TO2)-R- 241.562 cmE^{\u22121} is related to the O-Zr-O bending. The mode near E(TO2)-R - 241.562 cmE^{\u22121} is related to the O-Zr-O bending, which is the characteristic mode of R3c and disappears with the increase of x. Secondly, the peak near E(TO3) + A1(3TO)-R - 579.51 cmE^{\u22121} is also the characteristic peak of the R3c phase. With the increase of x, the peak width gradually disappears and split into A1(3TO) and E(TO3). All these indicate that the structure of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics changes from R3c to P4mm phase. The PFM measurements were conducted within an 8 \u03bcm \u2217 8 \u03bcm rectangular region to illustrate the alterations in domain structure of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics, as depicted in (a\u2013i). The polarization axis of the rhombohedral phase aligns parallel to [111], resulting in eight potential domain orientations and the formation of 71\xb0, 180\xb0, and 109\xb0 domain structures. The 71\xb0 and 109\xb0 domain are characterized by the wedge-shaped domain which is shown in the blue oval and arrow in (b) in rhombohedral PZT-PMS-PSN ceramic. The 180\xb0 domain is characterized by the lamellar domain that is marked as the pink oval and arrow in (b). Different from rhombohedral phase, the polarization axis of the tetragonal phase is aligned parallel to [001], resulting in six potential domain orientations, which give rise to 90\xb0 and 180\xb0 domain structures. The 90\xb0 domain are characterized by the herringbone-like domain which is shown in the green oval and arrow in (e) in tetragonal PZT-PMS-PSN ceramic. The variation trend of the dielectric constant (\u03b5r) and dielectric loss of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics at different temperatures is illustrated in (a\u2013e), with x content ranging from 0.48 to 0.56 and a frequency range of 0.1\u2013100 kHz. It can be seen from (f) that with the increase of x, the Curie temperature increases, and the temperature is 309, 315, 328.1, 333.1 and 335.1 respectively, which is conducive to the improvement of the stability of temperature. In order to find out the effect of x addition on the ferroelectric performance of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics, the polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loops of unpoled PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics at room temperature and 10 Hz are shown in (a\u2013b). The saturated polarization (P max), remnant polarization (P r ) and coercive field (E c\u2212, E c+) associated with the composition are illustrated in (c\u2013d). The E c+ first increases and then slightly decreases with the increase of x addition, which means enhancing the \u201csoft\u201d effect and stabilizing the \u201chard\u201d effect for piezoelectric materials. And the Ei decreases with the increase of x addition, which demonstrates that \u201chard\u201d effect is stable. generated the defect dipole (PD) and form an internal field (Ei) that provides a restoring force for the spontaneously polarized Ps. The hysteresis loop of the polarization-electric field (P-E) for poled PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics at room temperature and 10 Hz is depicted in (e), while the corresponding internal bias field Ei is illustrated in (f). It can be observed that the internal bias field of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics increases as the phase structure transitions from R3c to P4mm, which is caused that the alignment of the defect oxygen vacancy symmetry with the tetragonal phase is facilitated. (a) displays the frequency dependence of impedance |Z| for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics of x = 0.48, 0.52, and 0.56 in 33 mode. It can be observed that the maximum phase angle a close approximation to 90\xb0, manifesting that the polarization reversal is fully saturated and the electrical properties are hardly related to the polarization conditions. The d33 and Qm values of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics exhibit variations with the x content, as illustrated in (b). The d33 of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics is 214, 265, 315, 225, and 156 respectively. The d33 of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics exhibits an initial increase followed by a decrease as x increases, reaching its maximum value of 315 at x = 0.52. This behavior can be attributed to the increased presence of the C1c2 phase, which leads to a reduction in Gibbs free energy difference and enhances polarization rotation diversity. Simultaneously, the easier movement of domain walls results in a decreased mechanical quality factor for the material. (c) shows the \u03b5r and tan\u03b4 of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics. The loss values are 0.224, 0.279, 0.290, 0.391, and 0.281, respectively. And the \u03b5r are 611, 966, 1126, 926 and 796, respectively. It can be observed that the tan\u03b4 and \u03b5r increases with the increase of x, and then decreases, which is mainly related to C1c2 structure that allows the polar axis to lie anywhere between the [001] and the [111] axes. The kp and g33 of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics are displayed in (d), The value of g33 decreases as x increases, while kp remains relatively stable for values of x below 0.54. (a) shows the bipolar strain versus electric field S-E loops of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics at room temperature and 10 Hz. Furthermore, the corresponding composition-dependent negative, positive, and total strain for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics are shown in (b). Specifically, The positive strain of PZT-PMS-PSN ceramics is 0.14 %, 0.19 %, 0.16 %, 0.12 %, and 0.13 %, respectively. Consequently, an enhanced strain was observed in the PZT-PMS-PSN ceramic of x = 0.50 and 0.52 near the MPB. And the PZT-PMS-PSN ceramic of x = 0.52 demonstrates exceptional piezoelectric properties and a low dielectric loss coefficient, with high d33 = 315 pC NE^{\u22121} and Qm = 1578, as well as low \u03b5r = 1160, tan\u03b4 = 0.288 %. summarizes some important properties for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramic of x = 0.52 and other hard piezoelectric materials for high-power applications. It can be found that the PZT-PMS-PSN ceramic of x = 0.52 has high Tc and low tan\u03b4. The subsequent analysis delves into the fundamental physical mechanism of piezoelectricity for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramic of x = 0.52. Rayleigh analysis enables a quantitative assessment of these intrinsic and extrinsic contributions, as demonstrated in the subsequent equation :  The polarizability P(E) is determined by the amplitude (E0) of the applied electric field. To prevent the nucleation of new domains, E0 was maintained below half of the coercive field EC. \u03b5init represents the reversible permittivity coefficient. The Rayleigh coefficient \u03b1 represents the piezoelectric external response, which can be interpreted as an irreversible displacement of the domain wall, calculated from the slope of \u03b5\u2217 with respect to E0. (a) displays a typical hysteresis loop for PZT-PMS-PSN ceramic of x = 0.52. The reverse permittivity coefficient \u03b5\u2217 is obtained by measuring the peak-to-peak polarization (Pp-p) at each electric field (E0) using the Rayleigh method, following these steps:  The field correlation values of \u03b5\u2217 obtained from are subjected to linear fitting, and the corresponding results are presented in (b). The values of \u03b5init and \u03b1 are illustrated in (c). It is noteworthy that at x = 0.52, both the \u03b5init and \u03b1 values exhibit a consistent trend and reach their maximum, indicating an amplification of intrinsic and external contributions, thereby resulting in an enhanced piezoelectric effect. The extrinsic contribution to the total dielectric response (\u03b1E0/(\u03b1E0 + \u03b5init)) is 9.3 % at x = 0.48, and decreases to 6.6 % at x = 0.52, indicating that the influence of inelastic domain wall motion on d33 is minimal.
