Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'Solvothermal', 'precursors': ['Barium', 'Titanium', 'Lithium'], 'steps': ['Li-doped BaTiO3 ceramics were synthesized with varying weight percentages of Li (0 wt%, 2 wt%, and 4 wt%) using the solvothermal approach.', 'Powders were pressed into pellets.', 'Pellets were sintered in a closed environment at 1100 °C for 2 h.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['Rietveld refinement', 'Elemental analysis', 'Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)', 'Selected area electron diffraction (SAED)', 'CrysTBox software', 'Dielectric impedance spectroscopy', 'X-ray diffraction (XRD)']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
