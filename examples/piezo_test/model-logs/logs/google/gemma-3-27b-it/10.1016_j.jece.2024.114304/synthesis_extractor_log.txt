The phase and crystal structures of pure In2Se3, SnSe, and In2Se3@SnSe heterojunctions were investigated through XRD analysis, as illustrated in. In the In2Se3 sample, both the hexagonal crystalline phase (JCPDS No. 65\u20133639, a = b = 7.1.1 \xc5, c = 19.3 \xc5) and the rhombohedral phase (JCPDS No. 45\u20131041, a = b = 3.99 \xc5, c = 28.39 \xc5) were identified, with a dominance of the hexagonal phase. SnSe exhibits diffraction peaks consistent with its pure orthorhombic structure, characterized by the space group Pnma (JCPDS No. 48\u20131224). The XRD patterns of In2Se3@SnSe heterojunctions show peaks corresponding to both In2Se3 and SnSe diffraction patterns. An increase in the molar content of SnSe resulted in a strengthening of the SnSe XRD diffraction peak intensity while weakening that of In2Se3. To explore the microstructural changes with varying SnSe content in In2Se3@SnSe, SEM measurements were conducted and are displayed in. SnSe displays a typical nanoplate morphology, while In2Se3 exhibits a nanosheet structure. However, all In2Se3@SnSe heterojunctions exhibit a flower-like spherical structure, which may be attributed to a chemical reaction involving Se in SnSe that produces In2Se3. Furthermore, the TEM image of In2Se3@SnSe-3 distinctly exhibits this flower-like spherical configuration ( a). The observed lattice spacing of 3.36 \xc5 and 2.39 \xc5 align with the (210) facets of SnSe and (116) facets of In2Se3, respectively, as revealed in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in b. Elemental mapping of In2Se3@SnSe-3 in c displays the even distribution of In, Se, and Sn elements. These findings collectively confirm the successful formation of the In2Se3@SnSe heterojunction, as supported by the XRD and TEM results. XPS measurements were conducted to examine the chemical composition, chemical state of samples, and the interfacial interaction between In2Se3 and SnSe. The XPS survey spectra of In2Se3@SnSe-3 elucidates the presence of In, Se, and Sn elements as the primary constituents of the composite catalyst. In the specific analysis for In2Se3, the In 3d binding energy exhibits two peaks at 452.3 and 444.8 eV. The peak corresponding to Se 3d can be attributed to Se 3d3/2 and Se 3d5/2, as indicated by two peaks at 54.6 and 53.7 eV, respectively ( a-b). In contrast, for SnSe, the Sn 3d peaks at 494.2 eV and 485.8 eV correspond to Sn 3d3/2 and Sn 3d5/2, respectively (c), displaying an asymmetric broad band. This suggests the coexistence of Sn ions in both SnE^{4+} and SnE^{2+} state. To accurately assess the proportional distribution of SnE^{4+} and SnE^{2+} states, the Sn 3d peaks were deconvoluted into four distinct peaks representing both species, with SnE^{2+} being predominant. Additionally, the Se 3d3/2 and Se 3d5/2 peaks are identified at 53.9 and 52.9 eV, respectively (d). Notably, upon combining In2Se3 with SnSe, the characteristic peaks of SnSe shift to higher binding energies, while those of In2Se3 move in the opposite direction. This peak shift in the XPS spectra indicates a robust interfacial interaction and electron transfer from SnSe to In2Se3. The optical absorption properties of the In2Se3, SnSe and In2Se3@SnSe-3 samples were studied and illustrated in a. In2Se3 exhibits a broader light absorption range, whereas SnSe prefers absorbing shorter wavelengths. Upon forming heterojunctions, In2Se3@SnSe-3 exhibits a notably intensified and extended absorption band. To estimate the band gap width of the semiconductors, the Tauc plot method was applied using the equation : where A, \u03b1, h, \u03bd, E g are constants representing absorptivity, Planck constant, frequency of light, and energy gap of the semiconductor, respectively. The exponent, n, varies based on the semiconductor type, assumed here as direct-gap semiconductors (n = 1/2). The inset of a illustrates the band gap (E g ) values of 1.80 eV for In2Se3 and 1.60 eV for SnSe. In b, both In2Se3 and SnSe were identified as n-type semiconductors, showing flat band potentials (E fb ) of \u22120.55 and \u22121.17 V (vs. Thus, the conductive band (CB) potential (E CB ) of In2Se3 and SnSe were estimated to be \u22120.45 and \u22121.07 V, respectively, referenced to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE, pH=7). The formula E fb (NHE) = E fb (Ag/AgCl) + 0.197 is used to calculate this result, with the E CB being approximately 0.1 V more negative than the E fb. The relevant parameters of energy band structure are commonly deduced using the equation E g = E VB \u2212 E CB , where E VB denotes the valence band (VB) potential. Consequently, the E VB values for In2Se3 and SnSe are determined to be 1.35 and 0.53 V, respectively. Furthermore, DFT calculations were employed to explore the interfacial charge transfer characteristics between In2Se3 and SnSe upon contact. The electrostatic potentials of In2Se3 and SnSe were calculated and are displayed in c-d. The work functions of In2Se3 and SnSe were calculated to be 5.20 and 4.58 eV, respectively. The difference in work function indicates the presence of charge transfer at the In2Se3/SnSe interface, with the higher work function of In2Se3 indicating electron transfer from SnSe to In2Se3. These results are consistent with the charge transfer observed in the XPS analysis. At the In2Se3@SnSe heterojunction interface, electrons and holes accumulate, generating an interfacial built-in electric field. This results in a positively charged surface for SnSe and a negatively charged surface for In2Se3. These outcomes collectively provide insights into the energy band structure of the In2Se3@SnSe heterojunction before and after contact, as illustrated in e. The PL spectra ( a) of In2Se3, SnSe and In2Se3@SnSe heterojunctions were recorded to assess the separation rate of photogenerated carriers, a vital factor influencing catalytic activity. All samples exhibit emission peaks around 476 nm, with peak intensity following the sequence: SnSe > In2Se3 > In2Se3@SnSe-1 > In2Se3@SnSe-4 > In2Se3@SnSe-2 > In2Se3@SnSe-3. The lower signal intensity in In2Se3@SnSe-3 suggests faster separation and slower recombination rate of photo-generated h E^{ } and e E^{ }. Compared to individual In2Se3 or SnSe, the relative intensity of all the In2Se3@SnSe samples is reduced, implying the heterojunction's ability to inhibit photocorrosion by accelerating the separation of photogenerated carriers , which is consistent with the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results. TRPL analysis (b and ) further supports the result. The average PL lifetimes decreased from 4.90 ns for In2Se3 to 4.49 ns for In2Se3@SnSe-3. This reduction in the lifetime of photoexcited charges indicates an effective electron migration between In2Se3 and SnSe, and enhanced utilization of photogenerated carriers within the heterojunction, which is beneficial for the photocatalytic reaction. This correlation is underscored by the photocurrent response, where In2Se3@SnSe-3 demonstrates the highest photocurrent density, indicative of superior photoelectric properties (c). Notably, the trend in photocurrent density for In2Se3, SnSe and In2Se3@SnSe is inversely related to the peak intensity observed in PL spectra. The photocatalytic reduction of U(VI) was evaluated over In2Se3, SnSe and In2Se3@SnSe heterojunctions, with each catalytic test conducted without sacrificial agents (d). It was found that the U(VI) concentration decreased to varying degrees under light irradiation. However, pure In2Se3 and pure SnSe exhibited poor photo-catalytic performance. As a comparison, the photocatalytic performance of In2Se3@SnSe initially increased and then decreased with rising SnSe content. Notably, the In2Se3@SnSe-3 catalyst achieved the highest U(VI) removal rate, reaching 78.5 % after a 60-minute catalytic process. This enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the superior photoelectric properties of the heterojunctions, facilitating the separation of photo-induced e E^{ } -h E^{ } pairs, as evident from both photocurrent response and PL spectra. These U(VI) removal rates were further corroborated using the reaction rate constant (k), calculated using the pseudo first-order kinetics model : where C 0 and C represent the TC concentrations before and after light treatment, respectively. g highlights that among the synthesized In2Se3@SnSe catalysts, In2Se3@SnSe-3 exhibits the highest k value (31.1\xd710E^{\u22123} minE^{\u22121}). This value is approximately 5.8 and 8.4 times greater than that of pure In2Se3 (5.4\xd710E^{\u22123} minE^{\u22121}) and SnSe (3.7\xd710E^{\u22123} minE^{\u22121}), respectively. The degradation of TC through photocatalysis displayed a consistent pattern, further confirming the superior photocatalytic efficiency of In2Se3@SnSe-3 (e and h). In addition, photocatalytic U(\u2165) reduction was investigated by varying the concentrations of TC introduced into the U(VI) solution. As the concentrations of TC increased, there was a corresponding enhancement in the rate of U(VI) removal, rising from 78.5 % to 89.3 %, as illustrated in f. The corresponding k value increased from 31.1\xd710E^{\u22123} minE^{\u22121} to 47.2\xd710E^{\u22123} minE^{\u22121} (i). Thus, it is confirmed that the presence of TC in the solution promotes U(VI) removal. The piezoelectric properties of In2Se3@SnSe-3 were systematically evaluated using PFM. a-c present topographic images alongside the vertical piezoresponse amplitude and phase images of In2Se3@SnSe-3 within a 3 \xb5m \xd7 3 \xb5m area. The confirmation of its excellent piezoelectric nature comes from the amplitude\u2013voltage butterfly loop and 180\xb0 phase reversed hysteresis loop under a \xb110 V direct current (DC) bias field (d-e). Crucially, the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 serves as a pivotal parameter for evaluating the mechanical-to-electrical coupling. Specifically, the approximate effective d 33 of In2Se3@SnSe-3 was derived as approximately 13.8 pm/V, as depicted in f. To study the impact of the piezoelectric effect on enhancing photocatalytic activity, this study also examined piezo-catalysis and piezo-photocatalysis of the In2Se3@SnSe-3 for U(\u2165) reduction and TC degradation in U(\u2165) solution containing 30 mg/L TC. g shows the time-dependent variations in U(\u2165) and TC concentration under three different conditions: light, ultrasound, and their combined application. The synergistic effect of photo- and piezo-catalysis is evident, significantly enhancing the U(\u2165) removal and TC degradation rate. Specifically, under simultaneous ultrasonic and light irradiation, In2Se3@SnSe-3 achieves a U(\u2165) removal rate of 98.9 % and a TC degradation rate of 99.3 %, surpassing the rate observed with either light or ultrasonic vibration alone. In addition to TC pollutants, various common organic pollutants, including carbamazepine (CBZ), 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP), norfloxacin (NOR), and bisphenol A (BPA), were selected to investigate the piezo-photocatalytic reduction of U(\u2165) in organic solution. High U(\u2165) removal rates were maintained across different organic solutions (h), with removal rates of 98.9 %, 98.2 %, 97.6 %, 97.3 %, and 96.2 % in TC, CBZ, 2,4-DCP, NOR, and BPA solutions, respectively. Concurrently, the degradation rates of the organics improved in the presence of U(\u2165) (i), indicating a synergistic effect between U(\u2165) removal and organics pollutant degradation. To investigate the reusability and stability of In2Se3@SnSe-3, five cycle tests of U(VI) reduction from TC wastewater were carried out, with the results illustrated in. Despite undergoing five cycles, the catalyst retained its robust redox capacity for U(VI) reduction and TC degradation. The U(VI) removal rate decreased from approximately 98.9\u201390.2 %, while the TC degradation rate decreased from 99.3 % to 87.7 % after five cycles. To elucidate the role of free radicals in the catalytic process, free radical trapping experiments were conducted by introducing various free radical scavengers into the TC solution and the U(\u2165) solution, respectively. Isopropanol (IPA), triethanolamine (TEOA), p-benzoquinone (p-BQ) and AgNO3 were utilized as scavengers for hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH), h E^{ }, superoxide radicals (\u2022O2 E^{\u2212}) and e E^{ }, respectively. a shows the U(\u2165) removal and TC degradation rate over In2Se3@SnSe-3 with different radical quenchers. Notably, the TEOA scavenger significantly impeded TC degradation, whereas p-BQ and IPA partially inhibited it. This suggests that h E^{ } is the main active species, while \u2022O2 E^{\u2212} and \u2022OH also contribute to the catalytic redox process during TC degradation. Details on TC degradation products and toxicity analysis are provided in the section ( and , ). Conversely, AgNO3 significantly hindered the U(VI) removal, while p-BQ partially inhibited it, indicating that e E^{\u2212} serves as the main active species, with \u2022O2 E^{\u2212} also contributing to the catalytic reduction process during U(VI) removal. Details on U(\u2165) reduction products are provided in the section. Accordingly, TC degradation is primarily associated with the oxidation process involving h E^{+}, whereas U(VI) reduction is directly related to e E^{\u2212}. These results provide further evidence supporting the hypothesis of a synergistic interaction between TC oxidation and U(VI) reduction. Furthermore, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) testing confirmed the generation of active species in the photocatalytic, piezo-catalytic, and piezo-photocatalytic systems. TEMPO and DMPO were used as trapping regents for h E^{ }, \u2022O2 E^{\u2212}, and \u2022OH radicals, respectively. b-d display robust signals of the TEMPO-h E^{ }, DMPO-\u2022OH, and DMPO-\u2022O2 E^{\u2212} during the three different catalytic modes. The generation of h E^{ } and radicals (\u2022OH and \u2022O2 E^{\u2212}) during the piezo-photocatalysis process exceeds that of photocatalysis and piezo-catalysis, aligning with the earlier discussed catalytic performance. To investigate the charge transfer dynamics under light irradiation, TA measurements were employed to explore exciton dynamics in both In2Se3 and In2Se3@SnSe-3. A pump pulse with a 400 nm wavelength at a 500 Hz repetition rate was used to excite the samples. a-b display the two-dimensional pseudocolor TA spectra plots of the samples, showing a negative signal (\u223c630 nm) associated with ground state exciton bleaching (GSB). Additionally, excluding the intense GSB signal, a broad excited-state absorption spanning 450\u2212700 nm was observed, signifying the hole trapping process in both samples. The TA spectra for In2Se3 and In2Se3@SnSe-3 quantitatively demonstrate these characteristics, indicating that both hole trapping and charge separation signals peak within 2 ps for both samples (c-d). A comparison of the pseudocolor plots and \u0394A spectra between In2Se3 and In2Se3@SnSe-3 reveals similar TA spectral features. To gain a deeper understanding of the differences in photo-induced electrons transfer dynamics between In2Se3 and In2Se3@SnSe-3, the GSB relaxation curves at 630 nm were analyzed using fitted results from normalized decay curves ( , ). Notably, compared to In2Se3, In2Se3@SnSe-3 exhibits a shorter lifetime, aligning with TRPL results. This accelerated electron quenching in the In2Se3@SnSe-3 heterojunction indicates interfacial electron transfer from In2Se3 to SnSe. Based on the analysis of these results, the possible charge transfer mechanisms for In2Se3@SnSe-3 in distinct catalytic processes are proposed. As displayed in e, under light excitation, e E^{ } absorb photon energy, elevating them to the CB and generating positively charged h E^{ } in the VB. Subsequently, the internal electric field drives the photogenerated e E^{ } from the CB of In2Se3 to the VB of SnSe, as verified by the TA results. Moreover, Coulombic attraction between e E^{ } in In2Se3 and h E^{ } in SnSe, along with band bending, reinforces this charge transfer process. Conversely, Coulombic repulsion, band bending, and the inherent electric field inhibit e E^{ } transfer from the CB of SnSe to the CB of In2Se3 (h E^{ } transfer from VB of In2Se3 to VB of SnSe). Ultimately, robust photogenerated e E^{ } and h E^{ } localize in the CB of SnSe and VB of In2Se3, respectively, while weak photogenerated charge carriers recombine. It is noteworthy that the CB potential of SnSe (\u22121.07 V vs NHE) is more negative than O2/\u2022O2 E^{\u2212} potential (\u22120.33 V vs NHE), favoring e E^{ } reactions with O2 to produce active \u2022O2 E^{\u2212}. However, the VB potential of In2Se3 (1.35 V vs NHE) suggests limited potential for photogenerated h E^{ } to oxidize H2O to \u2022OH. Nonetheless, \u2022OH can form from the CB electrons of SnSe through a two-electron oxidation pathway, which is generated by the reaction of activated \u2022O2 E^{\u2212} with e E^{ }. The application of external ultrasound alongside illumination increases the built-in electric field and broadens the space charge zone at the interface of the In2Se3@SnSe-3 heterojunction. Consequently, the heightened piezoelectric potential in the In2Se3@SnSe-3 heterojunction further accelerates e E^{ }-h E^{ } pairs separation, thereby amplifying photocatalytic redox performance. The piezo-, photo-, and piezo-photocatalytic H2 production was investigated. It is evident that, without a sacrificial agent, minimal H2 production was observed during piezo-photocatalysis. However, in the catalytic reaction from an aqueous Na2S/Na2SO3 solution, Na2S and Na2SO3 acted as hole scavengers, consuming the generated holes on the VB, while the generated electrons on the CB reduce H2O to produce H2. As demonstrated, the piezo-photocatalytic activity displayed significantly enhanced performance compared to individual photocatalytic and piezo-catalytic activities, with a H2 production rate of 4.3 mmol gE^{\u22121}hE^{\u22121} within 4 hours. Additionally, compared to pure SnSe and In2Se3, the In2Se3@SnSe-3 heterojunction showed a significant increase in H2 production yield. To examine the effects of the S-scheme heterojunction on H2 production, the Gibbs free energies were calculated, with \u0394GH* close to zero being more favorable for the H2 production reaction. shows that In2Se3@SnSe has the lowest \u0394GH*, indicating that the proton reduction rate is greatly increased by the S-scheme heterojunction formed by In2Se3 and SnSe. In line with experimental findings , the results demonstrate that the heterojunction is responsible for the anticipated acceleration of catalytic activity toward H2 production. As previously elucidated in the mechanism of TC degradation, adequate TC enables the consumption of piezo-photogenerated h E^{ } during degradation. Consequently, it promotes the separation of piezo-photoinduced charge carriers and extends the lifetime of electrons, facilitating the H2 production reaction. This mechanism is similar to using a specific quantity of Na2S/Na2SO3 sacrificial agent. Subsequently, the piezo-, photo-, and piezo-photocatalytic H2 production from a TC solution (pH=5) over the In2Se3@SnSe-3 catalyst was evaluated without sacrificial agent, as shown in a-b. H2 production consistently increased with extended irradiation duration, peaking in piezo-photocatalysis after 2 hours. Specifically, within 1 hour, the H2 production and TC degradation rate were as follows: 527 \u03bcmol gE^{\u22121}hE^{\u22121} and 67.2 % for piezo-catalysis, 701 \u03bcmol gE^{\u22121}hE^{\u22121} and 84.8 % for photocatalysis, and 972 \u03bcmol gE^{\u22121}hE^{\u22121} and 94.8 % for piezo-photocatalysis, demonstrating outstanding H2 production and TC degradation performances. The H2 production rate significantly surpassed that of individual photocatalysis and piezo-catalysis when combined. Furthermore, a direct correlation emerged between the H2 production rate and TC degradation rate: as TC degradation increased, so did the H2 production rate. The higher the degradation degree of TC, the higher the H2 production rate. This enhancement stems from the piezo-photocatalytic process, which accelerates the separation of e E^{ } -h E^{ } pairs at the In2Se3@SnSe-3 heterojunction and fosters the generation of more active species. Additionally, the gradual decrease in H2 production rate over time can be ascribed to the diminishing TC concentration. indicates the piezo-photocatalytic stability of the In2Se3@SnSe-3 for H2 production from TC wastewater. After five cycles, the catalyst continued to demonstrate notable H2 production activity and efficacy in TC degradation. The H2 production rate decreased from 972 to 852 \u03bcmol gE^{\u22121}hE^{\u22121} and the TC degradation rate decreased from 94.8 % to 86.5 %, indicative of the stability and good recyclability of In2Se3@SnSe-3. Furthermore, an in-depth investigation into the influence of TC concentration on both the H2 production rate and TC degradation rate was pursued through gradient experiments. Various TC concentrations of 10 mg/L, 30 mg/L, 50 mg/L, and 70 mg/L were employed, as shown in c-d. It is evident that the H2 production rate was lower at low TC concentrations (10 mg/L, 30 mg/L). Specifically, there was almost no H2 production after 1 hour at a TC concentration of 10 mg/L. Upon quantification of the H2 production rate, it was determined that the rate at higher concentrations was about 3.6 times greater than that at lower concentrations. In addition, with an increase in TC concentration, the degradation rate gradually decreased. For instance, it decreased from 99.3 % in a 10 mg/L TC solution to 63.7 % in a 70 mg/L TC solution within 1 hour. After a two-hour reaction, the TC solution at a concentration of 70 mg/L notably further decreased , indicating that a specific quantity of catalyst could only decompose a limited amount of TC within a certain time. Concurrently, the H2 production rate increased gradually from 611 \u03bcmolgE^{\u22121}hE^{\u22121} in a 10 mg/L TC solution to 1417 \u03bcmol gE^{\u22121}hE^{\u22121} in a 70 mg/L TC solution. From these results, it can be inferred that TC serves as hole scavenger, effectively removing the generated holes to mitigate the recombination of e E^{ } -h E^{ } pairs, thereby facilitating the piezo-photocatalytic H2 production. In addition to TC, CBZ, 2,4-DCP, NOR, and BPA were also chosen as organic pollutants to investigate piezo-photocatalytic H2 production from organic wastewater. The H2 production for all five different pollutants is clearly demonstrated in (organics concentration: 70 mg/L). The catalysts exhibited remarkable H2 production across a diverse range of pollutants, showing their broad applicability.

The phase and crystal structures of pure In2Se3, SnSe, and In2Se3@SnSe heterojunctions were investigated through XRD analysis, as illustrated in. In the In2Se3 sample, both the hexagonal crystalline phase (JCPDS No. 65\u20133639, a = b = 7.1.1 \xc5, c = 19.3 \xc5) and the rhombohedral phase (JCPDS No. 45\u20131041, a = b = 3.99 \xc5, c = 28.39 \xc5) were identified, with a dominance of the hexagonal phase.

The XRD patterns of In2Se3@SnSe heterojunctions show peaks corresponding to both In2Se3 and SnSe diffraction patterns. An increase in the molar content of SnSe resulted in a strengthening of the SnSe XRD diffraction peak intensity while weakening that of In2Se3. To explore the microstructural changes with varying SnSe content in In2Se3@SnSe, SEM measurements were conducted and are displayed in. SnSe displays a typical nanoplate morphology, while In2Se3 exhibits a nanosheet structure. However, all In2Se3@SnSe heterojunctions exhibit a flower-like spherical structure, which may be attributed to a chemical reaction involving Se in SnSe that produces In2Se3. Furthermore, the TEM image of In2Se3@SnSe-3 distinctly exhibits this flower-like spherical configuration ( a). The observed lattice spacing of 3.36 \xc5 and 2.39 \xc5 align with the (210) facets of SnSe and (116) facets of In2Se3, respectively, as revealed in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in b. Elemental mapping of In2Se3@SnSe-3 in c displays the even distribution of In, Se, and Sn elements. These findings collectively confirm the successful formation of the In2Se3@SnSe heterojunction, as supported by the XRD and TEM results. XPS measurements were conducted to examine the chemical composition, chemical state of samples, and the interfacial interaction between In2Se3 and SnSe. The XPS survey spectra of In2Se3@SnSe-3 elucidates the presence of In, Se, and Sn elements as the primary constituents of the composite catalyst. In the specific analysis for In2Se3, the In 3d binding energy exhibits two peaks at 452.3 and 444.8 eV. The peak corresponding to Se 3d can be attributed to Se 3d3/2 and Se 3d5/2, as indicated by two peaks at 54.6 and 53.7 eV, respectively ( a-b). In contrast, for SnSe, the Sn 3d peaks at 494.2 eV and 485.8 eV correspond to Sn 3d3/2 and Sn 3d5/2, respectively (c), displaying an asymmetric broad band. This suggests the coexistence of Sn ions in both SnE^{4+} and SnE^{2+} state. To accurately assess the proportional distribution of SnE^{4+} and SnE^{2+} states, the Sn 3d peaks were deconvoluted into four distinct peaks representing both species, with SnE^{2+} being predominant. Additionally, the Se 3d3/2 and Se 3d5/2 peaks are identified at 53.9 and 52.9 eV, respectively (d). Notably, upon combining In2Se3 with SnSe, the characteristic peaks of SnSe shift to higher binding energies, while those of In2Se3 move in the opposite direction. This peak shift in the XPS spectra indicates a robust interfacial interaction and electron transfer from SnSe to In2Se3. The optical absorption properties of the In2Se3, SnSe and In2Se3@SnSe-3 samples were studied and illustrated in a. In2Se3 exhibits a broader light absorption range, whereas SnSe prefers absorbing shorter wavelengths. Upon forming heterojunctions, In2Se3@SnSe-3 exhibits a notably intensified and extended absorption band. To estimate the band gap width of the semiconductors, the Tauc plot method was applied using the equation : where A, \u03b1, h, \u03bd, E g are constants representing absorptivity, Planck constant, frequency of light, and energy gap of the semiconductor, respectively. The exponent, n, varies based on the semiconductor type, assumed here as direct-gap semiconductors (n = 1/2). The inset of a illustrates the band gap (E g ) values of 1.80 eV for In2Se3 and 1.60 eV for SnSe. In b, both In2Se3 and SnSe were identified as n-type semiconductors, showing flat band potentials (E fb ) of \u22120.55 and \u22121.17 V (vs. Thus, the conductive band (CB) potential (E CB ) of In2Se3 and SnSe were estimated to be \u22120.45 and \u22121.07 V, respectively, referenced to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE, pH=7). The formula E fb (NHE) = E fb (Ag/AgCl) + 0.197 is used to calculate this result, with the E CB being approximately 0.1 V more negative than the E fb. The relevant parameters of energy band structure are commonly deduced using the equation E g = E VB \u2212 E CB , where E VB denotes the valence band (VB) potential. Consequently, the E VB values for In2Se3 and SnSe are determined to be 1.35 and 0.53 V, respectively. Furthermore, DFT calculations were employed to explore the interfacial charge transfer characteristics between In2Se3 and SnSe upon contact. The electrostatic potentials of In2Se3 and SnSe were calculated and are displayed in c-d. The work functions of In2Se3 and SnSe were calculated to be 5.20 and 4.58 eV, respectively. The difference in work function indicates the presence of charge transfer at the In2Se3/SnSe interface, with the higher work function of In2Se3 indicating electron transfer from SnSe to In2Se3. These results are consistent with the charge transfer observed in the XPS analysis. At the In2Se3@SnSe heterojunction interface, electrons and holes accumulate, generating an interfacial built-in electric field. This results in a positively charged surface for SnSe and a negatively charged surface for In2Se3. These outcomes collectively provide insights into the energy band structure of the In2Se3@SnSe heterojunction before and after contact, as illustrated in e. The PL spectra ( a) of In2Se3, SnSe and In2Se3@SnSe heterojunctions were recorded to assess the separation rate of photogenerated carriers, a vital factor influencing catalytic activity. All samples exhibit emission peaks around 476 nm, with peak intensity following the sequence: SnSe > In2Se3 > In2Se3@SnSe-1 > In2Se3@SnSe-4 > In2Se3@SnSe-2 > In2Se3@SnSe-3. The lower signal intensity in In2Se3@SnSe-3 suggests faster separation and slower recombination rate of photo-generated h E^{ } and e E^{ }. Compared to individual In2Se3 or SnSe, the relative intensity of all the In2Se3@SnSe samples is reduced, implying the heterojunction's ability to inhibit photocorrosion by accelerating the separation of photogenerated carriers , which is consistent with the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results. TRPL analysis (b and ) further supports the result. The average PL lifetimes decreased from 4.90 ns for In2Se3 to 4.49 ns for In2Se3@SnSe-3. This reduction in the lifetime of photoexcited charges indicates an effective electron migration between In2Se3 and SnSe, and enhanced utilization of photogenerated carriers within the heterojunction, which is beneficial for the photocatalytic reaction. This correlation is underscored by the photocurrent response, where In2Se3@SnSe-3 demonstrates the highest photocurrent density, indicative of superior photoelectric properties (c). Notably, the trend in photocurrent density for In2Se3, SnSe and In2Se3@SnSe is inversely related to the peak intensity observed in PL spectra. The photocatalytic reduction of U(VI) was evaluated over In2Se3, SnSe and In2Se3@SnSe heterojunctions, with each catalytic test conducted without sacrificial agents (d). It was found that the U(VI) concentration decreased to varying degrees under light irradiation. However, pure In2Se3 and pure SnSe exhibited poor photo-catalytic performance. As a comparison, the photocatalytic performance of In2Se3@SnSe initially increased and then decreased with rising SnSe content. Notably, the In2Se3@SnSe-3 catalyst achieved the highest U(VI) removal rate, reaching 78.5 % after a 60-minute catalytic process. This enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the superior photoelectric properties of the heterojunctions, facilitating the separation of photo-induced e E^{ } -h E^{ } pairs, as evident from both photocurrent response and PL spectra. These U(VI) removal rates were further corroborated using the reaction rate constant (k), calculated using the pseudo first-order kinetics model : where C 0 and C represent the TC concentrations before and after light treatment, respectively. g highlights that among the synthesized In2Se3@SnSe catalysts, In2Se3@SnSe-3 exhibits the highest k value (31.1\xd710E^{\u22123} minE^{\u22121}). This value is approximately 5.8 and 8.4 times greater than that of pure In2Se3 (5.4\xd710E^{\u22123} minE^{\u22121}) and SnSe (3.7\xd710E^{\u22123} minE^{\u22121}), respectively. The degradation of TC through photocatalysis displayed a consistent pattern, further confirming the superior photocatalytic efficiency of In2Se3@SnSe-3 (e and h). In addition, photocatalytic U(\u2165) reduction was investigated by varying the concentrations of TC introduced into the U(VI) solution. As the concentrations of TC increased, there was a corresponding enhancement in the rate of U(VI) removal, rising from 78.5 % to 89.3 %, as illustrated in f. The corresponding k value increased from 31.1\xd710E^{\u22123} minE^{\u22121} to 47.2\xd710E^{\u22123} minE^{\u22121} (i). Thus, it is confirmed that the presence of TC in the solution promotes U(VI) removal. The piezoelectric properties of In2Se3@SnSe-3 were systematically evaluated using PFM. a-c present topographic images alongside the vertical piezoresponse amplitude and phase images of In2Se3@SnSe-3 within a 3 \xb5m \xd7 3 \xb5m area. The confirmation of its excellent piezoelectric nature comes from the amplitude\u2013voltage butterfly loop and 180\xb0 phase reversed hysteresis loop under a \xb110 V direct current (DC) bias field (d-e). Crucially, the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 serves as a pivotal parameter for evaluating the mechanical-to-electrical coupling. Specifically, the approximate effective d 33 of In2Se3@SnSe-3 was derived as approximately 13.8 pm/V, as depicted in f. To study the impact of the piezoelectric effect on enhancing photocatalytic activity, this study also examined piezo-catalysis and piezo-photocatalysis of the In2Se3@SnSe-3 for U(\u2165) reduction and TC degradation in U(\u2165) solution containing 30 mg/L TC. g shows the time-dependent variations in U(\u2165) and TC concentration under three different conditions: light, ultrasound, and their combined application. The synergistic effect of photo- and piezo-catalysis is evident, significantly enhancing the U(\u2165) removal and TC degradation rate. Specifically, under simultaneous ultrasonic and light irradiation, In2Se3@SnSe-3 achieves a U(\u2165) removal rate of 98.9 % and a TC degradation rate of 99.3 %, surpassing the rate observed with either light or ultrasonic vibration alone. In addition to TC pollutants, various common organic pollutants, including carbamazepine (CBZ), 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP), norfloxacin (NOR), and bisphenol A (BPA), were selected to investigate the piezo-photocatalytic reduction of U(\u2165) in organic solution. High U(\u2165) removal rates were maintained across different organic solutions (h), with removal rates of 98.9 %, 98.2 %, 97.6 %, 97.3 %, and 96.2 % in TC, CBZ, 2,4-DCP, NOR, and BPA solutions, respectively. Concurrently, the degradation rates of the organics improved in the presence of U(\u2165) (i), indicating a synergistic effect between U(\u2165) removal and organics pollutant degradation. To investigate the reusability and stability of In2Se3@SnSe-3, five cycle tests of U(VI) reduction from TC wastewater were carried out, with the results illustrated in. Despite undergoing five cycles, the catalyst retained its robust redox capacity for U(VI) reduction and TC degradation. The U(VI) removal rate decreased from approximately 98.9\u201390.2 %, while the TC degradation rate decreased from 99.3 % to 87.7 % after five cycles. To elucidate the role of free radicals in the catalytic process, free radical trapping experiments were conducted by introducing various free radical scavengers into the TC solution and the U(\u2165) solution, respectively. Isopropanol (IPA), triethanolamine (TEOA), p-benzoquinone (p-BQ) and AgNO3 were utilized as scavengers for hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH), h E^{ }, superoxide radicals (\u2022O2 E^{\u2212}) and e E^{ }, respectively. a shows the U(\u2165) removal and TC degradation rate over In2Se3@SnSe-3 with different radical quenchers. Notably, the TEOA scavenger significantly impeded TC degradation, whereas p-BQ and IPA partially inhibited it. This suggests that h E^{ } is the main active species, while \u2022O2 E^{\u2212} and \u2022OH also contribute to the catalytic redox process during TC degradation. Details on TC degradation products and toxicity analysis are provided in the section ( and , ). Conversely, AgNO3 significantly hindered the U(VI) removal, while p-BQ partially inhibited it, indicating that e E^{\u2212} serves as the main active species, with \u2022O2 E^{\u2212} also contributing to the catalytic reduction process during U(VI) removal. Details on U(\u2165) reduction products are provided in the section. Accordingly, TC degradation is primarily associated with the oxidation process involving h E^{+}, whereas U(VI) reduction is directly related to e E^{\u2212}. These results provide further evidence supporting the hypothesis of a synergistic interaction between TC oxidation and U(VI) reduction. Furthermore, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) testing confirmed the generation of active species in the photocatalytic, piezo-catalytic, and piezo-photocatalytic systems. TEMPO and DMPO were used as trapping regents for h E^{ }, \u2022O2 E^{\u2212}, and \u2022OH radicals, respectively. b-d display robust signals of the TEMPO-h E^{ }, DMPO-\u2022OH, and DMPO-\u2022O2 E^{\u2212} during the three different catalytic modes. The generation of h E^{ } and radicals (\u2022OH and \u2022O2 E^{\u2212}) during the piezo-photocatalysis process exceeds that of photocatalysis and piezo-catalysis, aligning with the earlier discussed catalytic performance. To investigate the charge transfer dynamics under light irradiation, TA measurements were employed to explore exciton dynamics in both In2Se3 and In2Se3@SnSe-3. A pump pulse with a 400 nm wavelength at a 500 Hz repetition rate was used to excite the samples. a-b display the two-dimensional pseudocolor TA spectra plots of the samples, showing a negative signal (\u223c630 nm) associated with ground state exciton bleaching (GSB). Additionally, excluding the intense GSB signal, a broad excited-state absorption spanning 450\u2212700 nm was observed, signifying the hole trapping process in both samples. The TA spectra for In2Se3 and In2Se3@SnSe-3 quantitatively demonstrate these characteristics, indicating that both hole trapping and charge separation signals peak within 2 ps for both samples (c-d). A comparison of the pseudocolor plots and \u0394A spectra between In2Se3 and In2Se3@SnSe-3 reveals similar TA spectral features. To gain a deeper understanding of the differences in photo-induced electrons transfer dynamics between In2Se3 and In2Se3@SnSe-3, the GSB relaxation curves at 630 nm were analyzed using fitted results from normalized decay curves ( , ). Notably, compared to In2Se3, In2Se3@SnSe-3 exhibits a shorter lifetime, aligning with TRPL results. This accelerated electron quenching in the In2Se3@SnSe-3 heterojunction indicates interfacial electron transfer from In2Se3 to SnSe. Based on the analysis of these results, the possible charge transfer mechanisms for In2Se3@SnSe-3 in distinct catalytic processes are proposed. As displayed in e, under light excitation, e E^{ } absorb photon energy, elevating them to the CB and generating positively charged h E^{ } in the VB. Subsequently, the internal electric field drives the photogenerated e E^{ } from the CB of In2Se3 to the VB of SnSe, as verified by the TA results. Moreover, Coulombic attraction between e E^{ } in In2Se3 and h E^{ } in SnSe, along with band bending, reinforces this charge transfer process. Conversely, Coulombic repulsion, band bending, and the inherent electric field inhibit e E^{ } transfer from the CB of SnSe to the CB of In2Se3 (h E^{ } transfer from VB of In2Se3 to VB of SnSe). Ultimately, robust photogenerated e E^{ } and h E^{ } localize in the CB of SnSe and VB of In2Se3, respectively, while weak photogenerated charge carriers recombine. It is noteworthy that the CB potential of SnSe (\u22121.07 V vs NHE) is more negative than O2/\u2022O2 E^{\u2212} potential (\u22120.33 V vs NHE), favoring e E^{ } reactions with O2 to produce active \u2022O2 E^{\u2212}. However, the VB potential of In2Se3 (1.35 V vs NHE) suggests limited potential for photogenerated h E^{ } to oxidize H2O to \u2022OH. Nonetheless, \u2022OH can form from the CB electrons of SnSe through a two-electron oxidation pathway, which is generated by the reaction of activated \u2022O2 E^{\u2212} with e E^{ }. The application of external ultrasound alongside illumination increases the built-in electric field and broadens the space charge zone at the interface of the In2Se3@SnSe-3 heterojunction. Consequently, the heightened piezoelectric potential in the In2Se3@SnSe-3 heterojunction further accelerates e E^{ }-h E^{ } pairs separation, thereby amplifying photocatalytic redox performance. The piezo-, photo-, and piezo-photocatalytic H2 production was investigated. It is evident that, without a sacrificial agent, minimal H2 production was observed during piezo-photocatalysis. However, in the catalytic reaction from an aqueous Na2S/Na2SO3 solution, Na2S and Na2SO3 acted as hole scavengers, consuming the generated holes on the VB, while the generated electrons on the CB reduce H2O to produce H2. As demonstrated, the piezo-photocatalytic activity displayed significantly enhanced performance compared to individual photocatalytic and piezo-catalytic activities, with a H2 production rate of 4.3 mmol gE^{\u22121}hE^{\u22121} within 4 hours. Additionally, compared to pure SnSe and In2Se3, the In2Se3@SnSe-3 heterojunction showed a significant increase in H2 production yield. To examine the effects of the S-scheme heterojunction on H2 production, the Gibbs free energies were calculated, with \u0394GH* close to zero being more favorable for the H2 production reaction. shows that In2Se3@SnSe has the lowest \u0394GH*, indicating that the proton reduction rate is greatly increased by the S-scheme heterojunction formed by In2Se3 and SnSe. In line with experimental findings , the results demonstrate that the heterojunction is responsible for the anticipated acceleration of catalytic activity toward H2 production. As previously elucidated in the mechanism of TC degradation, adequate TC enables the consumption of piezo-photogenerated h E^{ } during degradation. Consequently, it promotes the separation of piezo-photoinduced charge carriers and extends the lifetime of electrons, facilitating the H2 production reaction. This mechanism is similar to using a specific quantity of Na2S/Na2SO3 sacrificial agent. Subsequently, the piezo-, photo-, and piezo-photocatalytic H2 production from a TC solution (pH=5) over the In2Se3@SnSe-3 catalyst was evaluated without sacrificial agent, as shown in a-b. H2 production consistently increased with extended irradiation duration, peaking in piezo-photocatalysis after 2 hours. Specifically, within 1 hour, the H2 production and TC degradation rate were as follows: 527 \u03bcmol gE^{\u22121}hE^{\u22121} and 67.2 % for piezo-catalysis, 701 \u03bcmol gE^{\u22121}hE^{\u22121} and 84.8 % for photocatalysis, and 972 \u03bcmol gE^{\u22121}hE^{\u22121} and 94.8 % for piezo-photocatalysis, demonstrating outstanding H2 production and TC degradation performances. The H2 production rate significantly surpassed that of individual photocatalysis and piezo-catalysis when combined. Furthermore, a direct correlation emerged between the H2 production rate and TC degradation rate: as TC degradation increased, so did the H2 production rate. The higher the degradation degree of TC, the higher the H2 production rate. This enhancement stems from the piezo-photocatalytic process, which accelerates the separation of e E^{ } -h E^{ } pairs at the In2Se3@SnSe-3 heterojunction and fosters the generation of more active species. Additionally, the gradual decrease in H2 production rate over time can be ascribed to the diminishing TC concentration. indicates the piezo-photocatalytic stability of the In2Se3@SnSe-3 for H2 production from TC wastewater. After five cycles, the catalyst continued to demonstrate notable H2 production activity and efficacy in TC degradation. The H2 production rate decreased from 972 to 852 \u03bcmol gE^{\u22121}hE^{\u22121} and the TC degradation rate decreased from 94.8 % to 86.5 %, indicative of the stability and good recyclability of In2Se3@SnSe-3. Furthermore, an in-depth investigation into the influence of TC concentration on both the H2 production rate and TC degradation rate was pursued through gradient experiments. Various TC concentrations of 10 mg/L, 30 mg/L, 50 mg/L, and 70 mg/L were employed, as shown in c-d. It is evident that the H2 production rate was lower at low TC concentrations (10 mg/L, 30 mg/L). Specifically, there was almost no H2 production after 1 hour at a TC concentration of 10 mg/L. Upon quantification of the H2 production rate, it was determined that the rate at higher concentrations was about 3.6 times greater than that at lower concentrations. In addition, with an increase in TC concentration, the degradation rate gradually decreased. For instance, it decreased from 99.3 % in a 10 mg/L TC solution to 63.7 % in a 70 mg/L TC solution within 1 hour. After a two-hour reaction, the TC solution at a concentration of 70 mg/L notably further decreased , indicating that a specific quantity of catalyst could only decompose a limited amount of TC within a certain time. Concurrently, the H2 production rate increased gradually from 611 \u03bcmolgE^{\u22121}hE^{\u22121} in a 10 mg/L TC solution to 1417 \u03bcmol gE^{\u22121}hE^{\u22121} in a 70 mg/L TC solution. From these results, it can be inferred that TC serves as hole scavenger, effectively removing the generated holes to mitigate the recombination of e E^{ } -h E^{ } pairs, thereby facilitating the piezo-photocatalytic H2 production. In addition to TC, CBZ, 2,4-DCP, NOR, and BPA were also chosen as organic pollutants to investigate piezo-photocatalytic H2 production from organic wastewater. The H2 production for all five different pollutants is clearly demonstrated in (organics concentration: 70 mg/L). The catalysts exhibited remarkable H2 production across a diverse range of pollutants, showing their broad applicability.
