Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'Solid-state reaction', 'precursors': ['K2CO3', 'Na2CO3', 'Nb2O5', 'Sb2O3', 'Bi2O3', 'Fe2O3', 'ZrO2', 'Ethyl alcohol', 'PDMS', 'Aluminum foil'], 'steps': ['Stoichiometric raw materials were weighed.', 'Raw materials were ball-milled in alcohol for 24 hours.', 'The mixed powder was dried at 100°C for 24 hours.', 'The powder was sieved to ensure uniform particle size.', 'The powder was calcined at 900°C for 6 hours.', 'The calcined powder was pressed into pellets at 100-200 MPa.', 'The pellets were sintered at 1120-1140°C for 3 hours.', 'KNNS-BF-xBNZ ceramic powder was dispersed in ethyl alcohol using sonication for 3 hours.', 'The dispersed powder was mixed with PDMS (0-30 wt%) and a curing agent (PDMS to curing agent ratio of 10:1).', 'The mixture was loaded into a mold and kept at room temperature for 48 hours.', 'The dried film was cut into 3x3 cm sheets with a thickness of 3 mm.', 'The composite film was sandwiched between aluminum foil sheets.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'FESEM-EDX', 'LCR meter', 'Ferroelectric test system', 'Quasi-static d33-meter', 'Digital oscilloscope', 'Digital multimeter']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
