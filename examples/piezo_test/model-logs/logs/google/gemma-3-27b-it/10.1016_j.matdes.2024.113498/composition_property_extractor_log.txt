# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a) shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the BNT-6BT-5BFO2M crushed ceramic. The XRD data was refined by GSAS software showing a single phase with a tetragonal symmetry of P4mm space group. The phase matching carried out indicates that the tiny peak marked by the red asterisk belongs to ZrO2 (see inset of (a)). The presence of ZrO2 probably comes from the milling media used in the ball milling step. Pure ZrO2 is non-magnetic, but in presence of defects it can exhibit magnetic activity. However, based on previous studies on related materials, in which ZrO2 was not detected as impurity, while the samples still showed ferromagnetism , it can be possibly inferred that it is not the presence of ZrO2 to induce ferromagnetic behaviour in the present composition. (b) shows the scanning electron microscope image of BNT-6BT-5BFO2M ceramics, evidencing grains with an average grain size estimated as 2.32 \u03bcm, using the Image J software. displays the temperature (300 K to 870 K) and frequency dependence of the dielectric permittivity ((a1)) and loss ( (a2)). The dielectric permittivity presents a frequency-independent anomaly at around 720 K (black dotted lines in (a1) and red circle in the relative in-set), which is also visible in the loss curves at low frequencies. As reported in previous studies on BFO-based ceramics , anomalies in the dielectric permittivity in the range 530 K-720 K could be ascribed to the antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition, the so-called N\xe9el temperature. The anomalies in permittivity and loss between 300 K and 500 K may be ascribed to the effect of oxygen vacancies, as supported by the XPS results in. In unmodified BFO, these features are commonly observed above 800 K; however, their position shifts towards lower temperature after Ba and Ti ions substitution. (b1)\u2013(e2) presents the PFM data before poling (b1 \u2212 topography, c1 \u2212 phase, d1 \u2212 amplitude and e1 \u2212 line profile along the blue line marked in (b)) and after poling (the respective images b2, c2, d2 and e2). The point poling was carried out by applying a DC field of + 30 V in the specific area marked by the encircled red cross in (b1-d1) and (b2-d2). (c1, d1) and (c2, d2) show distinct changes in the PFM amplitude and phase, suggesting a domain reorientation after poling. The amplitude and phase profiles along the blue line in (b1) and 2(b2), as recorded before and after poling, are shown in the respective (e1) and (e2). The apparent variations in the PFM amplitude and phase values within the poling area indicate the occurrence of field-induced domain switching. It can be noticed that the amplitude and phase signals show no reversal in the area where no electric field was applied ((e1) and (e2)), denoting that domains are locally tunable by the applied electric field. By applying the AC electric field from \u22120.8 V to + 0.8 V at room temperature using the PFM tip, a slim phase vs bias hysteresis loop was generated (cf. c). The classical ferroelectric P-E hysteresis loop obtained at room temperature and 60 kV/cm shows a maximum polarization Pmax \u2248 6 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} and a remnant polarization Pr \u2248 0.6 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} (e). The piezoelectric coefficient d33 = 27.6 pC/N of the poled sample unambiguously proves domains alignment induced by the applied electric field during poling, and hence ferroelectricity , in the BNT-6BT-5BFO2M system. f shows the frequency dependence of the dielectric permittivity and loss at room temperature. The tan\u03b4 and dielectric permittivity of ceramic disk in the low frequency range from 40 Hz to 5 kHz were also calculated as 0.18 and 870, respectively, by using impedance-phase angle data (f). shows the fitted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data of BNT-6BT-5BFO2M ceramics relative to O 1 s, Bi 4f, Ba 3d, Ti 2p, Mn 2p and Fe 2p, calibrated with the C 1 s line (284.8 eV) binding energy. (a) shows the high-resolution core spectrum of O 1 s. The three peaks located at 529.5 eV, 530.3 eV and 531.9 eV are commonly ascribed to oxygen-metal bonds, oxygen vacancies and absorbed oxygen, respectively, in the available literature (see for instance Ref. among others). (b) shows the high-resolution core spectrum of Bi 4f. The two strong peaks located at 164.1 eV and 158.8 eV correspond to Bi 4f5/2 and Bi 4f7/2; the binding energy span of 5.30 eV between these two peaks indicates that the bismuth element is stable in the 3 + valence state. The high-resolution core spectrum of Ba 5d is shown in (c). The binding energy peak of Ba 5d5/2 falls at 778.8 eV, indicating that Ba ions are present in the 2 + valence state. The deconvolution of the peak in the spectrum of Mn 2p3/2 reveals the presence of two underlying peaks located at 641.6 eV and 642.7 eV ((d)), which implies that the Mn ions are in the oxidation states of 3 + and 4+, corresponding to the respective peaks. (e) shows the high-resolution core spectra of Fe 2p. The binding energy corresponding to the Fe 2p3/2 main peak is 710.3 eV with a satellite peak at 718.9 eV, reflecting the 3 + valence state for the Fe ions in BNT-6BT-5BFO2M. The presence of peaks at 457.6 eV in the Ti 2p XPS spectrum shown in (f) is consistent with the Ti 2p spectra reported for other perovskite titanates. However, the exact identification of the Ti valence state remains challenging as the the Ti 2p1/2 peak usually located in the binding energy range 461\u2013465 eV is superimposed by the much larger Bi 4d3/2 peak. The peak in the Ti 2p spectrum around 457.6 eV (the Ti 2p3/2 peak) could be well-fitted by a single peak; however, the peak\u2019s asymmetry supports the presence of TiE^{4+} and TiE^{3+} ions. The presence of oxygen vacancies could be ascribed to the requirement to maintain charge neutrality in presence of Ti ions in the valence state 3+, when Mn partially substitutes Fe at the B-site, and to balance possible deficiency of volatile elements that might evaporate during the calcination and sintering processes. shows the dependence of the magnetization (M) on the magnetic field (H) for BNT-6BT-5BFO2M at 10 K, 20 K, 30 K ((a)) and 285 K ((b)). The paramagnetic background of the substrate has been subtracted from the recorded M\u2212H loops. The room-temperature ferromagnetic nature is evidenced by the well-saturated M\u2212H loops with a remnant magnetization of about 0.01 emu/g and symmetric coercive fields (cf. ). As indicated in , the Ba, Bi, Fe, Mn and Ti ions in BNT-6BT-5BFO2M have 2+, 3+, 3+, 3+/4 + and 3+/4 + valence state, respectively. The stoichiometry is possibly balanced by TiE^{3+}, MnE^{4+} and oxygen vacancies; therefore, the composition quoted represents the nominal stoichiometry. The spontaneous magnetization of BNT-6BT-5BFO2M is affected by the presence of MnE^{4+} ions, similarly to the ferromagnetism in Mn-doped Aurivillius phase multiferroics. The substituted Mn ions in BFO are expected to not only introduce FeE^{3+}-O-MnE^{4+} bonds with ferromagnetic double-exchange interactions (cf. ), but also to distort the antiferromagnetic cycloid ordering, contributing to the net ferromagnetic moment at room temperature. The double-exchange interaction is mediated by (real) electron transfers between the half-filled eg orbitals of FeE^{3+} and the two empty MnE^{4+} eg orbitals. Apart from the double-exchange, the oxygen vacancies could also contribute to the net magnetic moment through the F-centres via the exchange effect, as shown in (c) and (d). shows the magnetic field-induced ferroelectric domain switching driven by a magnetic field and captured using PFM. The out-of-plane polarization is recorded without ((a) topography, 5(c) phase) and with ((b) topography, 5(d) phase) an applied magnetic field (+2000 Oe, in plane) at room temperature. Under the applied magnetic field of 2000 Oe, some of the in-plane domains reorient towards the out-of-plane direction (see (c) and (d)). This behaviour provides the evidence that the ferroelectric polarization of BNT-6BT-5BFO2M ceramics can be tuned by a magnetic field at room temperature. shows the resonance magnetoelectric dynamics induced in the GHz. Around 11.65 and 15.76 GHz, the complex dielectric permittivity (\u03b5=\u03b5\u2032+i\u03b5\u2033) and complex magnetic permeability (\u03bc=\u03bc\u2032+i\u03bc\u2033) both exhibit resonant behaviour. The ME coupling effect can be attributed to the stereo-chemical activity of 6 sE^{2} lone pair electrons of BiE^{3+} in BNT-6BT and BFO that would contribute to the B-site ions displacement and further affect the magnetic spin order also through the FeE^{3+}-O-MnE^{4+} bonds. The resonance peaks in the imaginary component of the permittivity \u03b5\u2033 in the GHz region can be ascribed to the effects of polarization induced by intrinsic and defect dipoles mediated by the presence of oxygen vacancies. The local dip in the imaginary permeability (\u03bc\u2033), related to an absorptive change of the precession damping of magnetic dipoles, occur at the same frequency of the resonance features in the dielectric properties, possibly indicating an intrinsic magnetoelectric coupling between spontaneous polarization and magnetic dipoles.

# ABSTRACT
In the search of single-phase multiferroic materials at room temperature, a ceramic system with composition 0.5(0.94Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-0.06BaTiO3)-0.5BiFe0.8Mn0.2O3 (BNT-6BT-5BFO2M) was fabricated via the solid-state reaction route, and its crystal structure, dielectric, ferroelectric, and magnetic properties were studied. The ferroelectricity is evidenced by the switching of ferroelectric domains, as imaged by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). The spontaneous net magnetization is mediated by the presence of Mn4+ ions, which may introduce ferromagnetic Fe3+-O-Mn4+ double-exchange interactions in the system. The PFM images taken during the application of a magnetic field of 2000 Oe revealed that the ferroelectric domain structure at room temperature can be significantly influenced by the magnetic field, reflecting the presence of a magnetoelectric effect that allows the occurrence of magnetic field-induced polarization reorientation.

# INTRODUCTION
In 1865, James Clerk Maxwell revealed that magnetic spin order and electric charge motion are intrinsically coupled, overcoming previous theories that considered magnetic spins and electric charges completely independent. Multiferroics are compounds that show the coexistence of ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism, and some exhibit the magnetoelectric (ME) coupling, translated in the possibility of tuning the electric order by an applied magnetic field, and vice-versa. The ME coupling in multiferroic materials could allow developing a new generation of magnetic spin devices, such as high speed and low energy consumption random access memories (RAMs) and magnetoelectric sensors that are capable of sensing small magnetic fields (pT scale) by reading electric signals. In fact, while an empty d orbital is required for generating ferroelectricity in BiFeO3-based multiferroics , a ferromagnetic ordered structure needs a partially-filled d orbital. The compounds 0.94Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-0.06BaTiO3 (BNT-6BT) and BiFeO3 (BFO) were selected as the main constituents of the solid solutions developed. The system BNT-6BT belongs to the family of bismuth-based perovskites, and it is considered a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) composition, showing the highest piezoelectric properties among BNT-BT systems, and probably the highest electric field-induced strain amongst Pb-free ferroelectrics , because their structure is highly sensitive to electric fields. To induce a magnetic order into the designed solid solution, BFO perovskite was selected. Up to date, BFO represents a rare example of room-temperature single-phase multiferroic material. However, the local short-range magnetic ordering of BiFeO3 is G-type antiferromagnetic. In this spin structure, each FeE^{3+} spin is surrounded by six imperfect antiparallel Fe spins with tiny canted angle; thus, the partial cancelation between each pair of FeE^{3+} spins leads to a tiny net magnetization. Additionally, Mn atoms were used for substituting part of the Fe atoms in BFO, because the addition of Mn could potentially improve the ferromagnetic properties in numerous systems, as reported not only for BFO-related ceramics, but also in Aurivillius phase ferroelectric films at room temperature. Moreover, the stereo-chemical activity of 6 sE^{2} lone pair electrons of BiE^{3+} in BNT-6BT and BFO would also contribute to the B-site ions displacement and further affect the magnetic spin order. Therefore, the possibility of inducing ME coupling in Mn-doped BNT-6BT-BFO solid solutions was envisaged. To verify this hypothesis, a series of compositions with different mole ratio of BNT-6BT-BFO with Mn additions were prepared; however, single phase was only observed in the composition 0.5(0.94Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-0.06BaTiO3)-0.5BiFe0.8Mn0.2O3 (BNT-6BT-5BFO2M), whose structure and multiferroic properties were investigated in this study.

# CONCLUSION
In this work, the structure, dielectric and multiferroic properties of 0.5(0.94Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-0.06BaTiO3)-0.5BiFe0.8Mn0.2O3 ceramics were thoroughly investigated for potential room-temperature magnetoelectric applications. The XRD data indicate that the ceramics adopt a perovskite single phase structure of a tetragonal P4mm symmetry. The ferroelectric property measurements, along with PFM imaging, revealed ferroelectric behaviour evidenced by polarization hysteresis and domains reorientation. The ferromagnetic nature of the ceramics at room temperature is testified by a non-negligible remnant magnetization (Mr \u223c 0.01 emu/g) in the M\u2212H loops. The possibility of inducing local polarization reversal by the application of a magnetic field was confirmed by the PFM images under an applied magnetic field of 2000 Oe, suggesting that bismuth-based perovskites can be appropriately designed for achieving multiferroic activity at room temperature. The presence of simultaneous resonance effects in the GHz range of dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability suggests the presence of an intrinsic magnetoelectric coupling. These coupling effects in the designed composition are believed to be induced by the effect of Bi\u2019s lone pair electrons on the Fe\u2019s magnetic spin order in BFO, mediated by the FeE^{3+}-O-MnE^{4+} double-exchange interactions resulting from the presence of MnE^{4+} ions, and the contribution of oxygen vacancies to the net magnetic moment through the F-centres.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a) shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the BNT-6BT-5BFO2M crushed ceramic. The XRD data was refined by GSAS software showing a single phase with a tetragonal symmetry of P4mm space group. The phase matching carried out indicates that the tiny peak marked by the red asterisk belongs to ZrO2 (see inset of (a)). The presence of ZrO2 probably comes from the milling media used in the ball milling step. Pure ZrO2 is non-magnetic, but in presence of defects it can exhibit magnetic activity. However, based on previous studies on related materials, in which ZrO2 was not detected as impurity, while the samples still showed ferromagnetism , it can be possibly inferred that it is not the presence of ZrO2 to induce ferromagnetic behaviour in the present composition. (b) shows the scanning electron microscope image of BNT-6BT-5BFO2M ceramics, evidencing grains with an average grain size estimated as 2.32 \u03bcm, using the Image J software. displays the temperature (300 K to 870 K) and frequency dependence of the dielectric permittivity ((a1)) and loss ( (a2)). The dielectric permittivity presents a frequency-independent anomaly at around 720 K (black dotted lines in (a1) and red circle in the relative in-set), which is also visible in the loss curves at low frequencies. As reported in previous studies on BFO-based ceramics , anomalies in the dielectric permittivity in the range 530 K-720 K could be ascribed to the antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition, the so-called N\xe9el temperature. The anomalies in permittivity and loss between 300 K and 500 K may be ascribed to the effect of oxygen vacancies, as supported by the XPS results in. In unmodified BFO, these features are commonly observed above 800 K; however, their position shifts towards lower temperature after Ba and Ti ions substitution. (b1)\u2013(e2) presents the PFM data before poling (b1 \u2212 topography, c1 \u2212 phase, d1 \u2212 amplitude and e1 \u2212 line profile along the blue line marked in (b)) and after poling (the respective images b2, c2, d2 and e2). The point poling was carried out by applying a DC field of + 30 V in the specific area marked by the encircled red cross in (b1-d1) and (b2-d2). (c1, d1) and (c2, d2) show distinct changes in the PFM amplitude and phase, suggesting a domain reorientation after poling. The amplitude and phase profiles along the blue line in (b1) and 2(b2), as recorded before and after poling, are shown in the respective (e1) and (e2). The apparent variations in the PFM amplitude and phase values within the poling area indicate the occurrence of field-induced domain switching. It can be noticed that the amplitude and phase signals show no reversal in the area where no electric field was applied ((e1) and (e2)), denoting that domains are locally tunable by the applied electric field. By applying the AC electric field from \u22120.8 V to + 0.8 V at room temperature using the PFM tip, a slim phase vs bias hysteresis loop was generated (cf. c). The classical ferroelectric P-E hysteresis loop obtained at room temperature and 60 kV/cm shows a maximum polarization Pmax \u2248 6 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} and a remnant polarization Pr \u2248 0.6 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} (e). The piezoelectric coefficient d33 = 27.6 pC/N of the poled sample unambiguously proves domains alignment induced by the applied electric field during poling, and hence ferroelectricity , in the BNT-6BT-5BFO2M system. f shows the frequency dependence of the dielectric permittivity and loss at room temperature. The tan\u03b4 and dielectric permittivity of ceramic disk in the low frequency range from 40 Hz to 5 kHz were also calculated as 0.18 and 870, respectively, by using impedance-phase angle data (f). shows the fitted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data of BNT-6BT-5BFO2M ceramics relative to O 1 s, Bi 4f, Ba 3d, Ti 2p, Mn 2p and Fe 2p, calibrated with the C 1 s line (284.8 eV) binding energy. (a) shows the high-resolution core spectrum of O 1 s. The three peaks located at 529.5 eV, 530.3 eV and 531.9 eV are commonly ascribed to oxygen-metal bonds, oxygen vacancies and absorbed oxygen, respectively, in the available literature (see for instance Ref. among others). (b) shows the high-resolution core spectrum of Bi 4f. The two strong peaks located at 164.1 eV and 158.8 eV correspond to Bi 4f5/2 and Bi 4f7/2; the binding energy span of 5.30 eV between these two peaks indicates that the bismuth element is stable in the 3 + valence state. The high-resolution core spectrum of Ba 5d is shown in (c). The binding energy peak of Ba 5d5/2 falls at 778.8 eV, indicating that Ba ions are present in the 2 + valence state. The deconvolution of the peak in the spectrum of Mn 2p3/2 reveals the presence of two underlying peaks located at 641.6 eV and 642.7 eV ((d)), which implies that the Mn ions are in the oxidation states of 3 + and 4+, corresponding to the respective peaks. (e) shows the high-resolution core spectra of Fe 2p. The binding energy corresponding to the Fe 2p3/2 main peak is 710.3 eV with a satellite peak at 718.9 eV, reflecting the 3 + valence state for the Fe ions in BNT-6BT-5BFO2M. The presence of peaks at 457.6 eV in the Ti 2p XPS spectrum shown in (f) is consistent with the Ti 2p spectra reported for other perovskite titanates. However, the exact identification of the Ti valence state remains challenging as the the Ti 2p1/2 peak usually located in the binding energy range 461\u2013465 eV is superimposed by the much larger Bi 4d3/2 peak. The peak in the Ti 2p spectrum around 457.6 eV (the Ti 2p3/2 peak) could be well-fitted by a single peak; however, the peak\u2019s asymmetry supports the presence of TiE^{4+} and TiE^{3+} ions. The presence of oxygen vacancies could be ascribed to the requirement to maintain charge neutrality in presence of Ti ions in the valence state 3+, when Mn partially substitutes Fe at the B-site, and to balance possible deficiency of volatile elements that might evaporate during the calcination and sintering processes. shows the dependence of the magnetization (M) on the magnetic field (H) for BNT-6BT-5BFO2M at 10 K, 20 K, 30 K ((a)) and 285 K ((b)). The paramagnetic background of the substrate has been subtracted from the recorded M\u2212H loops. The room-temperature ferromagnetic nature is evidenced by the well-saturated M\u2212H loops with a remnant magnetization of about 0.01 emu/g and symmetric coercive fields (cf. ). As indicated in , the Ba, Bi, Fe, Mn and Ti ions in BNT-6BT-5BFO2M have 2+, 3+, 3+, 3+/4 + and 3+/4 + valence state, respectively. The stoichiometry is possibly balanced by TiE^{3+}, MnE^{4+} and oxygen vacancies; therefore, the composition quoted represents the nominal stoichiometry. The spontaneous magnetization of BNT-6BT-5BFO2M is affected by the presence of MnE^{4+} ions, similarly to the ferromagnetism in Mn-doped Aurivillius phase multiferroics. The substituted Mn ions in BFO are expected to not only introduce FeE^{3+}-O-MnE^{4+} bonds with ferromagnetic double-exchange interactions (cf. ), but also to distort the antiferromagnetic cycloid ordering, contributing to the net ferromagnetic moment at room temperature. The double-exchange interaction is mediated by (real) electron transfers between the half-filled eg orbitals of FeE^{3+} and the two empty MnE^{4+} eg orbitals. Apart from the double-exchange, the oxygen vacancies could also contribute to the net magnetic moment through the F-centres via the exchange effect, as shown in (c) and (d). shows the magnetic field-induced ferroelectric domain switching driven by a magnetic field and captured using PFM. The out-of-plane polarization is recorded without ((a) topography, 5(c) phase) and with ((b) topography, 5(d) phase) an applied magnetic field (+2000 Oe, in plane) at room temperature. Under the applied magnetic field of 2000 Oe, some of the in-plane domains reorient towards the out-of-plane direction (see (c) and (d)). This behaviour provides the evidence that the ferroelectric polarization of BNT-6BT-5BFO2M ceramics can be tuned by a magnetic field at room temperature. shows the resonance magnetoelectric dynamics induced in the GHz. Around 11.65 and 15.76 GHz, the complex dielectric permittivity (\u03b5=\u03b5\u2032+i\u03b5\u2033) and complex magnetic permeability (\u03bc=\u03bc\u2032+i\u03bc\u2033) both exhibit resonant behaviour. The ME coupling effect can be attributed to the stereo-chemical activity of 6 sE^{2} lone pair electrons of BiE^{3+} in BNT-6BT and BFO that would contribute to the B-site ions displacement and further affect the magnetic spin order also through the FeE^{3+}-O-MnE^{4+} bonds. The resonance peaks in the imaginary component of the permittivity \u03b5\u2033 in the GHz region can be ascribed to the effects of polarization induced by intrinsic and defect dipoles mediated by the presence of oxygen vacancies. The local dip in the imaginary permeability (\u03bc\u2033), related to an absorptive change of the precession damping of magnetic dipoles, occur at the same frequency of the resonance features in the dielectric properties, possibly indicating an intrinsic magnetoelectric coupling between spontaneous polarization and magnetic dipoles.

# ABSTRACT
In the search of single-phase multiferroic materials at room temperature, a ceramic system with composition 0.5(0.94Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-0.06BaTiO3)-0.5BiFe0.8Mn0.2O3 (BNT-6BT-5BFO2M) was fabricated via the solid-state reaction route, and its crystal structure, dielectric, ferroelectric, and magnetic properties were studied. The ferroelectricity is evidenced by the switching of ferroelectric domains, as imaged by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). The spontaneous net magnetization is mediated by the presence of Mn4+ ions, which may introduce ferromagnetic Fe3+-O-Mn4+ double-exchange interactions in the system. The PFM images taken during the application of a magnetic field of 2000 Oe revealed that the ferroelectric domain structure at room temperature can be significantly influenced by the magnetic field, reflecting the presence of a magnetoelectric effect that allows the occurrence of magnetic field-induced polarization reorientation.

# INTRODUCTION
In 1865, James Clerk Maxwell revealed that magnetic spin order and electric charge motion are intrinsically coupled, overcoming previous theories that considered magnetic spins and electric charges completely independent. Multiferroics are compounds that show the coexistence of ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism, and some exhibit the magnetoelectric (ME) coupling, translated in the possibility of tuning the electric order by an applied magnetic field, and vice-versa. The ME coupling in multiferroic materials could allow developing a new generation of magnetic spin devices, such as high speed and low energy consumption random access memories (RAMs) and magnetoelectric sensors that are capable of sensing small magnetic fields (pT scale) by reading electric signals. In fact, while an empty d orbital is required for generating ferroelectricity in BiFeO3-based multiferroics , a ferromagnetic ordered structure needs a partially-filled d orbital. The compounds 0.94Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-0.06BaTiO3 (BNT-6BT) and BiFeO3 (BFO) were selected as the main constituents of the solid solutions developed. The system BNT-6BT belongs to the family of bismuth-based perovskites, and it is considered a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) composition, showing the highest piezoelectric properties among BNT-BT systems, and probably the highest electric field-induced strain amongst Pb-free ferroelectrics , because their structure is highly sensitive to electric fields. To induce a magnetic order into the designed solid solution, BFO perovskite was selected. Up to date, BFO represents a rare example of room-temperature single-phase multiferroic material. However, the local short-range magnetic ordering of BiFeO3 is G-type antiferromagnetic. In this spin structure, each FeE^{3+} spin is surrounded by six imperfect antiparallel Fe spins with tiny canted angle; thus, the partial cancelation between each pair of FeE^{3+} spins leads to a tiny net magnetization. Additionally, Mn atoms were used for substituting part of the Fe atoms in BFO, because the addition of Mn could potentially improve the ferromagnetic properties in numerous systems, as reported not only for BFO-related ceramics, but also in Aurivillius phase ferroelectric films at room temperature. Moreover, the stereo-chemical activity of 6 sE^{2} lone pair electrons of BiE^{3+} in BNT-6BT and BFO would also contribute to the B-site ions displacement and further affect the magnetic spin order. Therefore, the possibility of inducing ME coupling in Mn-doped BNT-6BT-BFO solid solutions was envisaged. To verify this hypothesis, a series of compositions with different mole ratio of BNT-6BT-BFO with Mn additions were prepared; however, single phase was only observed in the composition 0.5(0.94Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-0.06BaTiO3)-0.5BiFe0.8Mn0.2O3 (BNT-6BT-5BFO2M), whose structure and multiferroic properties were investigated in this study.

# CONCLUSION
In this work, the structure, dielectric and multiferroic properties of 0.5(0.94Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-0.06BaTiO3)-0.5BiFe0.8Mn0.2O3 ceramics were thoroughly investigated for potential room-temperature magnetoelectric applications. The XRD data indicate that the ceramics adopt a perovskite single phase structure of a tetragonal P4mm symmetry. The ferroelectric property measurements, along with PFM imaging, revealed ferroelectric behaviour evidenced by polarization hysteresis and domains reorientation. The ferromagnetic nature of the ceramics at room temperature is testified by a non-negligible remnant magnetization (Mr \u223c 0.01 emu/g) in the M\u2212H loops. The possibility of inducing local polarization reversal by the application of a magnetic field was confirmed by the PFM images under an applied magnetic field of 2000 Oe, suggesting that bismuth-based perovskites can be appropriately designed for achieving multiferroic activity at room temperature. The presence of simultaneous resonance effects in the GHz range of dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability suggests the presence of an intrinsic magnetoelectric coupling. These coupling effects in the designed composition are believed to be induced by the effect of Bi\u2019s lone pair electrons on the Fe\u2019s magnetic spin order in BFO, mediated by the FeE^{3+}-O-MnE^{4+} double-exchange interactions resulting from the presence of MnE^{4+} ions, and the contribution of oxygen vacancies to the net magnetic moment through the F-centres.
