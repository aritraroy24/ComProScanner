The (Ba1-xCax)(SnyTi1-y)O3 (where x=0.016, y=0.024; x=0.032, y=0.048; x=0.048, y=0.072; x=0.064, y=0.096; x=0.08, y=0.12; abbreviated BCST-1; BCST-2; BCST-3; BCST-4; and BCST-5 respectively) piezoelectric ceramics were made using metal oxides and carbonates by a solid-state reaction process. Raw ingredients included Barium Carbonate (BaCO3), Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3), Tin Oxide (SnO2), and Titanium Oxide (TiO2), all of which are 99 % pure analytical grade reagents from Sigma Aldrich. The stoichiometric ratio was used to weigh each powder, and the mixture was wet milled for 24 hours in ethanol medium using polyethylene bottles containing zirconia balls stabilized with yttria. The milled precursors were calcined at 1200 \xbaC for 4 hours in a zirconia crucible after being dried in an oven at 80 \xbaC overnight. The combined powders were then pelletized into disc-shaped samples using a 5 wt.% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) binder. At a heating rate of 2 \xbaC per minute, the sintering was carried out for 4 hours at 1450 \xbaC. After polishing the sintered pellets on silicon carbide paper, pellets were coated with silver paint on both sides and allowed to dry for 30 minutes at 600 \xbaC to facilitate electrical measurement. The crystal structure and phase identification of sintered ceramics were examined by an X-ray diffractometer (D8 Advanced, Bruker Inc., Germany) using Cu K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb= 1.5406 \xc5). The Raman effect measurements were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw In Via microscope Raman) using a He-Ne laser of 532 nm in the range of 100 cmE^{\u22121} to 1000 cmE^{\u22121}. The microstructure and compositional analysis were determined by using a scanning electron microscope (JEOL-JSM 6306 A) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) spectrometer attachment (Oxford Instrument). The temperature-dependent dielectric measurements were carried out by using a PSM 1735 (10\u03bcHz \u2013 35 MHz, Newtons4th Ltd, UK) impedance analyzer. A P-E loop tracer (Marine India, New Delhi, India) was used to record the polarisation versus electric field (P-E) hysteresis loops at an applied frequency of 50 Hz. The converse piezoelectric effect and electrostrictive analysis were conducted by measuring the electric field-induced strain using a ferroelectric test instrument (TF Analyzer 2000 of M/s. aixAcct Systems, GmbH, Germany). The temperature-dependent DC strain measurement was carried out by using a strain gauge (gauge factor 2.07 \xb11 %, gauge resistance 350 \xb11 \u03a9, and gauge length 3 mm), digital handheld data logger (TC32K; TYPE S-2770, Tokyo Sokki Kenkyojo Co. Ltd.) and high voltage regulated DC power supply (JOMA, VS3K05P). The piezoelectric coefficient (d33) was measured using a d33 meter Berlincourt meter (PiezoMeter System PM 300, Piezotest Pte Ltd.) at 110 Hz with an applied force of 250 mN, the piezoelectric charge coefficient, or d33, of electrically poled ceramics was determined. According to IEEE standards for piezoelectric characterizations, the electromechanical coupling coefficient of radial vibration mode, kp was determined using the resonance and anti-resonance method on a PSM 1735 (10\u03bcHz \u2013 35 MHz, Newtons4th Ltd, UK) impedance analyzer.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of BCST-1, BCST-2, BCST-3, BCST-4, and BCST-5 sintered ceramics recorded at room temperature. The XRD pattern shreds of evidence that all BCST ceramics possess pure perovskite structure without any traces of impurity, suggesting CaE^{2+} and SnE^{4+} are well diffused into the host lattice of BaTiO3 at the A-site and B-site respectively. The background was refined by using a 12-coefficient Fourier-cosine series. The refinement method uses a least square approach to refine the scale coefficients, B-factor coefficients, cell parameters (a, b, c, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3), FWHM parameters (U, V, W), shape parameters, zero coefficients, and displacement coefficients. Refinement analysis reveals that the BCST-1, BCST-2, and BCST-3 ceramics exhibit Amm2 and P4mm space groups having orthorhombic and tetragonal crystal symmetries respectively at room temperature. The phase % contribution for the tetragonal (P4mm) crystal structure is more than the orthorhombic (Amm2) crystal structure for BCST-1 to BCST-3 ceramics. The BCST-4 ceramic possesses Amm2, P4mm, and R3m space groups having orthorhombic, tetragonal, and rhombohedral crystal symmetries with phase percentage contributions are 25.42 %, 37.17 %, and 37.41 % respectively, suggesting R-O-T multiphase coexistence at room temperature. It is observed that BCST-4 ceramic contains more contribution of rhombohedral phase (R3m) than orthorhombic (Amm2) and tetragonal (P4mm) phase. Further increasing CaE^{2+} and SnE^{4+} content for BCST-5 ceramic shows a phase coexistence of tetragonal (P4mm) and cubic (Pm3m) crystal structure at room temperature. The \u03c7E^{2} value for all samples is less than 5 indicating the good agreement between the calculated and observed pattern. To determine the stability of the perovskite structure (ABO3), Goldschmidt defined the tolerance factor (t) as , Where RA, RB, and RO are the ionic radii of the A-site ion, B-site ion, and O ion respectively. For oxygen ion (OE^{2-}), the ionic radius is 1.40 \xc5. The calculated values of the tolerance factor are 1.0615, 1.0589, 1.0562, 1.0535, and 1.0509 respectively. It is observed that for all samples, the value of the tolerance factor decreases with increasing concentration of CaE^{2+} and SnE^{4+}content at A-site and B-site respectively. This is because of the substitution of smaller ion radius CaE^{2+} (ionic radius is 1.33 \xc5) for BaE^{2+} (ionic radius is 1.61 \xc5) at 12-fold coordinated site i.e. A-site and larger ion radius SnE^{4+} (ionic radius is 0.69 \xc5) for TiE^{4+} (ionic radius is 0.605 \xc5) at 6-fold coordinated site i.e. The \u2018t\u2019 value less than 0.9 or higher than 1.1 indicates an unstable perovskite structure. All ceramics have \u2018t\u2019 values in the range between 1.05 and 1.06 indicating stable perovskite structure. The tetragonality i.e. c/a ratio is estimated for all BCST samples from Rietveld data. The c/a ratio of all BCST samples shows a similar decreasing trend with the tolerance factor, which is in the range of 1.008\u20131.005 exhibiting high tetragonality (see ). shows the Raman spectra of BCST-1, BCST-2, BCST-3, BCST-4, and BCST-5 ceramics at room temperature measured in the frequency range of 100 cmE^{\u22121} to 1000 cmE^{\u22121}. The unit cell of the ABO3 perovskite structure contains five atoms with 15 degrees of freedom which belongs to the 4 F1 u + F2 u irreducible representation. There exist 12 optical vibrational modes that belong to 3 F1 u + F2 u representations while the remaining one of the symmetry modes F1 u corresponds to the acoustic branch. Each F1 u mode is split into A1 mode and E mode and each F2 u mode splits into B1 mode and E mode when transforming from Pm3m (cubic) to P4mm (tetragonal) phase and has C4\u028b symmetry. The A1 phonon modes and E phonon modes are both Raman and infrared active while the B1 phonon mode is only Raman active in both the P4mm and Pm3m (cubic) phases. The A1 phonon modes and E phonon modes further split into a pair of modes viz. transverse optical (TO) and longitudinal optical (LO) due to the presence of long-range electrostatic forces induced between the ions. The BCST-1, BCST-2, BCST-3, BCST-4, and BCST-5 ceramics consist of sharp distinctive peaks of a perovskite ferroelectric phase at around 296 cmE^{\u22121} and broad peaks at around 520 cmE^{\u22121} and 724 cmE^{\u22121} which corresponds to E(TO2), A1(TO3)/E(TO), and A1(LO3)/E(LO3) vibrational modes respectively. The sharp peak around wavenumber 296 cmE^{\u22121} is the characteristic peak of the tetragonal (P4mm) phase. Hence, all BCST ceramics exhibit a tetragonal (P4mm) phase. Moreover, the interference due to anharmonic coupling between three A1(TO) phonons is related to the appearance of dip at 176 cmE^{\u22121}. The BCST-1, BCST-2, and BCST-3 ceramics consist of a sharp dip in the region around 176 cmE^{\u22121} which gradually weakens with increasing concentration of CaE^{2+} and SnE^{4+} content for BCST-4 and BCST-5 ceramics. The weakening of the dip at 176 cmE^{\u22121} indicates the reduction of coupling between A1(TO) vibrational modes. Pokorny et. al. and Zheng et. al. reported the presence of A1 g octahedral breathing mode at around 800 cmE^{\u22121} which is related to cation disorder and non-random distributions of ions at B-site. For simple perovskites, the A1 g octahedral breathing mode is Raman inactive. However, the A1 g octahedral breathing mode is Raman active in complex perovskite and solid solutions with two or more B-site ceramics. The A1 g octahedral breathing mode is observed for compositions where the CaE^{2+} ion sits at the Ti site. shows no evidence of any mode for all BCST ceramics in the region around 800 cmE^{\u22121} which corresponds to A1 g octahedral breathing mode. The absence of A1 g octahedral breathing mode in Raman spectra confirms that the CaE^{2+} ion is well diffused into the Ba-site of (Ba1-xCax) (SnyTi1-y) O3 perovskite structure without any short-range cation disorder. It is well known that during polymorphic phase transition, the region between 100 cmE^{\u22121} to 300 cmE^{\u22121} is most affected in Raman spectra. The changes seen in this region are mainly related to polar BO6 vibrations that are associated with the orthorhombic (Amm2) phase and Rhombohedral (R3m) phase. The BCST-1, BCST-2, BCST-3, and BCST-4 ceramics consist of vibrational mode A1(TO2) has a vibrational frequency near 230 cmE^{\u22121} for the orthorhombic (Amm2) phase and it shifts to 267 cmE^{\u22121} for the tetragonal (P4mm) phase i.e. for BCST-5 ceramics. Xiao et. al. designated the A1(LO1) mode to the vibration band near 191 cmE^{\u22121}. Perry and Hall studied the Raman spectra of pure BaTiO3 revealing that the vibrational mode A1(LO1) only exists in the orthorhombic (Amm2) phase and rhombohedral (R3m) phase and vanishes in the tetragonal (P4mm) and Cubic (Pm3m) phase. The BCST-1, BCST-2, BCST-3, and BCST-4 ceramics exhibit A1(LO1) mode to the vibration band near 191 cmE^{\u22121} and vanishes for BCST-5 ceramics indicating the existence of tetragonal (P4mm) and cubic (Pm3m) phase for BCST-5 ceramics. Moreover, for BCST-4 composition, the three vibrational modes viz. E(TO1), A1(LO1) and A1(TO1) corresponding to three peaks at frequencies 106 cmE^{\u22121}, 155 cmE^{\u22121} and 191 cmE^{\u22121} respectively are observed which is characteristic of the rhombohedral (R3m) phase.These observations of vibrational modes A1(LO1) and A1(TO1) suggest that BCST1, BCST-2, and BCST-3 compositions have a co-existence of tetragonal (P4mm) and orthorhombic (Amm2) phase and BCST-4 composition has a multiphase co-existence of tetragonal (P4mm), orthorhombic (Amm2), and rhombohedral (R3m) phases at room temperature. However, BCST-5 ceramics exhibit the coexistence of tetragonal (P4mm) and cubic (Pm3m) crystal structures at room temperature. Raman results and Rietveld results for all (Ba1-xCax) (SnyTi1-y)O3 compositions are well matched with each other confirming the corresponding phases for all samples. ) shows the SEM images of BCST-1, BCST-2, BCST-3, BCST-4, and BCST-5 ceramics with the inset of grain size distribution sintered at 1450\xb0C for 4 hours. All BCST ceramics show a fingerprint-like morphology with significant enhancement in grain size (> 70 \xb5m) shown in supplementary Figure S1. This substantial enhancement in grain size for BCST ceramics is attributed to an increase in the domain size. The average grain size of all BCST ceramics was calculated using Image J software by averaging at least more than 100 grains and values for all ceramics are tabulated in. The BCST-1 and BCST-2 ceramics show a large average grain size of about 90.89 \xb5m and 97.90 \xb5m respectively, which decreases monotonously to 70.43 \xb5m for BCST-4 ceramics and again increases for BCST-5 ceramics as SnE^{4} E^{+} content increases. The dense microstructure was observed for all ceramics; however, inhomogeneous grain distributions were observed for all ceramics except BCST-4 ceramic. The BCST-4 ceramics possess optimal diffuse phase transition revealing homogeneous grain distribution. For BCST-4 ceramics domain wall motion is relatively easier and regular due to the uniform grain distribution. Moreover, the BCST-4 exhibits a smaller domain width which specifies the lesser area of the domain wall. The movement of the 90\xb0 domain wall is responsible for piezoelectric properties. With the decrease in grain size, the 90\xb0 domain width decreases. The smaller area domain walls rotate more conveniently and respond progressively to external electrical signals attributing enhancement in piezoelectric properties of BCST-4 ceramic. The density measurement was carried out by using a density meter in xylene medium (density of xylene = 0.86 g/cmE^{3}). The relative density is highest (98.17 %) for BCST-4 ceramics because of their homogeneous grain distribution in the microstructure. The experimental, theoretical, and relative densities for all ceramics are tabulated in. ) shows the EDS spectra for BCST ceramics which confirm the existence of Ba, Ca, Sn, Ti, and O elements in (Ba1-xCax) (SnyTi1-y)O3 ceramics. shows the temperature dependence of dielectric constant for BCST-1, BCST-2, BCST-3, BCST-4, and BCST-5 ceramics measured at 1 kHz, 10 kHz, 100 kHz, and 1 MHz frequencies respectively between the temperature range of \u2212150\xbaC to 150\xbaC. All ceramics exhibit polymorphic phase transition (PPT) behavior. For BCST-1, BCST-2, BCST-3, and BCST-4 ceramics, the three pronounced dielectric peaks are associated with three ferroelectric transitions viz. rhombohedral to orthorhombic (TR-O), orthorhombic to tetragonal (TO-T) and tetragonal to cubic (TT-C) are observed. For BCST-5 ceramic, the three-phase transition peaks merge into one broad peak at Tc, which is caused by replacing TiE^{4+} with SnE^{4+} at the B site. The Curie temperature (Tc) is about 112\xbaC for BCST-1 ceramic. The linear decline of Curie temperature (Tc) was observed in all BCST ceramics. Tc drops to room temperature (Tc \u223c 28 \xbaC) for BCST-5 ceramics. The non-ferroelectric SnO6 octahedra enters the matrix of the ferroelectric phase due to the substitution of SnE^{4+} in the place of TiE^{4+}. The non-ferroelectric regions disrupt the long-range order of the TiO6 ferroelectric octahedra, causing unstable off-center displacements of SnE^{4+} atoms and oxygen ligands, which lead to lowering Tc. All BCST ceramics possess moderate dielectric constant values \u223c >10000. The dielectric constant (\u03b5r) value for all BCST ceramics increases with increasing SnE^{4+}. An extortionate dielectric constant value for BCST-4 (\u03b5r \u223c17414) and BCST-5 (\u03b5r \u223c19914) ceramics was observed. The Curie temperature (Tc) and dielectric constant (\u03b5r) values are listed in. The relation between diffuse phase transition and temperature which is given by modified Curie-Wiess law , Where \u03b5m is the maximum dielectric constant value at Tc, Tm is the temperature at a maximum dielectric constant, \u03b3 is diffuseness and C is the Curie-Wiess constant. Phase transition is given by \u03b3 value. If \u03b3 = 1, the material exhibits normal ferroelectric phase transition i.e. materials follow normal Curie-Wiess law. \u03b3 = 2 describes the relaxor behavior of the material and 1 < \u03b3 < 2 denotes a diffuse phase transition of the material. shows the graph of ln[1/\u03b5r - 1/\u03b5m] versus ln[T - Tm] graph of all BCST ceramics at the applied frequency 1 kHz were plotted to find out the \u03b3 value of ceramics. The calculated \u03b3 values for BCST ceramics are tabulated in. The \u03b3 values lie in the range between 1.34 and 1.70 indicating all BCST ceramics exhibit diffuse phase transition. The \u03b3 value increases for BCST-1 to BCST-4 ceramics suggesting that phase transition becomes more diffuse with increasing SnE^{4+} substitution, but with further increasing SnE^{4+}, for BCST-5 ceramic \u03b3 value decreases. As analyzed above, the incorporation of SnE^{4+} has a significant effect on diffuse phase transition behavior. A series of graphs of 1/\u03b5r versus temperature at applied frequency 1 kHz is shown in and the graph for other said frequencies 10 kHz,100 kHz, and 1 MHz for all ceramics are shown in Supplementary Figure S2 (a-e). As the content of CaE^{2+} and SnE^{4+} increases, the first two transitions i.e. TR-O and TO-T for BCST-1 and BCST-4 ceramics become closer and disappear for BCST-5 ceramics. These results indicate that TR-O and TO-T phases tend to merge for BCST-4 ceramics. So, BCST-4 ceramics have R-O-T multiphase coexistence at room temperature which is also confirmed by Rietveld refinement as mentioned in XRD analysis as well as Raman analysis. For BCST-5 ceramics all peaks merge and show only one transition TT-C. The deviation from the Curie-Weiss law is given by parameter \u2206Tm, which is calculated by the following equation : Where Tcw is Curie-Weiss temperature and Tm is the temperature at a maximum dielectric constant. The calculated \u2206Tm values of BCST-1 to BCST-5 at applied frequency 1 kHz are 6 \xb0C,5 \xb0C,8 \xb0C, 9 \xb0C, and 7 \xb0C respectively. The higher \u0394Tm value is associated with higher \u03b3 values. Therefore, in all BCST ceramics, it is found that \u2206Tm and \u03b3 values show an identical trend, which is shown in  a-e) shows the room temperature Polarization versus Electric field graph (P-E) of BCST-1, BCST-2, BCST-3, BCST-4 and BCST-5 ceramics at frequency 50 Hz. The electric breakdown strength (BDS) is 41.06 kV/cm for BCST-1, 33.20 kV/cm for BCST-2, 35.36 kV/cm for BCST-3, 53.64 kV/cm for BCST-4 and 50.81 kV/cm for BCST-5 ceramics. The BCST-4 ceramics exhibit higher breakdown strength (BDS) i.e. 53.81 kV/cm. The higher breakdown strength for BCST-4 ceramic is due to its uniform and dense microstructure. It is observed that the polarization hysteresis loop tends to become slim with increasing CaE^{2+} and SnE^{4+} content. The value of Ec for BCST-1 ceramics is in the range of 3.48 kV/cm to 4.84 kV/cm which further decreases for BCST-5 ceramics in the range between 1.24 kV/cm to 1.70 kV/cm. For BCST-4 ceramics the lower value of Ec (\u2053 in the range between 1.82 kV/cm to 2.48 kV/cm) is due to R-O-T multiphase coexistence. The BCST-4 ceramics possess a major contribution of the rhombohedral phase (37.41 %), with the orthorhombic (25.42 %) and tetragonal phase (37.17 %) i.e R-O-T multiphase, revealing that the polarization vector easily rotates without having to overcome the significant energy barrier and effectively improves the piezoelectric properties. As the P-E loop is recorded at room temperature, therefore the lower value of Ec for BCST-5 ceramics is due to its lower Tc (28 \xb0C). Moreover, Pr values for BCST ceramics are varied by the substitution of CaE^{2+} and SnE^{4+} concentration, which results from distinct structural changes. The energy storage density for all BCST ceramics is calculated from the P-E hysteresis loop by using the following relation , Where Pr is remnant polarization, Pm is maximum polarization and E is the applied electric field. The energy storage efficiency(\u019e) is calculated by the following relation,  The Wrec of BCST-1, BCST-2, BCST-3, BCST-4, and BCST-5 is 109.49 mJ/cmE^{3}, 86.84 mJ/cmE^{3}, 102.03 mJ/cmE^{3}, 165.87 mJ/cmE^{3,} and 110.89 mJ/cmE^{3} respectively shown in. All BCST ceramics have efficiency in the range of 38.45\u201373.94 %. The obtained maximum energy storage value is 165.87 mJ/cmE^{3} for BCST-4 ceramics with an efficiency of 68.00 %. Hence, BCST-4 ceramics is a promising candidate for energy storage applications. The temperature-dependent P-E measurement of all (Ba1-xCax)(SnyTi1-y)O3 ceramics are carried out near their curie temperature to check the temperature stability ferroelectric properties of the ceramics is shown in Figure S3 (a-e). It is observed that all BCST ceramics exhibit the stable typical ferroelectric hysteresis even at higher temperatures showing good thermal stability. shows the frequency-dependent impedance (|Z|) and phase angle (\u03b8) for electrically poled BCST-1, BCST-2, BCST-3, BCST-4, and BCST-5 ceramics. Poling is essential to induce piezoelectric response to any ferroelectric material by application of the DC electric field. The poling of all BCST ceramics has been done under the DC voltage equal to their coercive field for 30 minutes at room temperature in a silicon oil bath to avoid electrical breakdown through air. The degree of poling in the ceramics is estimated from phase angle (\u03b8). All BCST ceramics show phase angle values in the range between 52\xb0 to 65\xb0 except BCST-5 ceramic. The BCST-5 ceramics have a lower curie temperature (Tc = 28\xb0C), consequently, it is difficult to pole at room temperature as its crystal structure changes from tetragonal to cubic causing the lowest value of \u03b8 = 4\xb0 at room temperature. For the measurement of the electromechanical coupling coefficient of radial vibration mode, kp, the disk-shaped pellet of thickness 1.23 mm and the diameter of electrode area 8.88 mm was used. All the BCST ceramics show kp more than 0.40 except BCST-5 ceramic due to its lower value of \u03b8. The higher value of kp = 0.45 is obtained for BCST-4 ceramics and is attributed to the R-O-T multiphase coexistence, which favors an easier motion of domain. The increment in the kp for BCST-4 ceramics indicates the sample is easier to pole and has easy polarization rotation, which effectively enhanced the piezoelectric properties for BCST-4 ceramics. All BCST ceramics possess the d33 value > 250 pC/N. The \u03b8, kp, and d33 values for all ceramics are tabulated in. The d33 value increases from BCST-1 ceramic to BCST-4 ceramic and again decreases for BCST-5 ceramic. The d33 = 452 pC/N is obtained for BCST-4 ceramics which is more than commercially available soft PZT (d33 = 370pC/N). The enhanced piezoelectric charge constant for BCST-4 ceramics is due to R-O-T multiphase coexistence at room temperature. Also, the decrease in Ec value contributes to the high piezoelectric constant (d33) as mentioned in the ferroelectric section. For BCST-5 ceramic, although it possesses a lower Ec value, its curie temperature (Tc = 28\u2103) is almost equal to room temperature leading its tetragonal crystal structure to transform into a cubic structure above 28\u2103, which will make it difficult to pole causing d33 value decreases to 252 pC/N. The higher piezoelectric charge coefficient with R-O-T multiphase coexistence at room temperature for BCST-4 ceramics with lower Ec value indicates that BCST-4 ceramics is a suitable candidate for lead-free piezoelectric application. So, BCST-4 ceramic is taken for further measurements. The efficiency of BCST-4 ceramics for actuator application is investigated by using a bipolar strain versus electric field (S-E) loop. shows the strain% versus electric field graph at different applied electric fields measured at 1 Hz frequency. The BCST-4 ceramic exhibits a typical butterfly-shaped hysteresis loop. The electric field is applied up to its electrical breakdown strength and it is in the range between 5.62 kV/cm to 22.51 kV/cm. It is observed that with increasing electric field values the strain increases from 0.0365 % (at 5.62 kV/cm) to 0.100 % (at 22.51 kV/cm). For BCST-4 ceramics, the presence of R-O-T multiphase coexistence at room temperature is ascribed to intrinsic contribution, and the lower value of Ec which facilitates easy domain switching is ascribed to extrinsic contribution responsible for obtaining the higher value of strain (0.10 %). The mechanical strain experienced by piezoelectric material per unit of applied electric field is given by quantity d33* (converse piezoelectric coefficient). The d33* for BCST-4 ceramics is measured at the different applied electric fields by using the relation d33* = Smax / Emax. The strain values for BCST-4 samples are > 400 pm/V at the different electric fields. For an electric field of 5.62 kV/cm, the obtained highest d33* value is 649 pm/V and decreases to 444 pm/V for an applied electric field of 22.51 kV/cm. The results indicate that strain increases with increasing electric field but d33* decreases with increasing electric field. The enhancement in strain and d33* for BCST-4 ceramics are due to the dynamic of R-O-T multiphase coexistence at room temperature which offers preferred oriented polarizations over 26 directions (i.e. for R-phase, O-phase, and T-phase there are 8, 12 and 6 directions respectively) and strain variants, making it much easier for different grains to coordinate a collective response. The electrostriction coefficient (Q33) describes the mechanical displacement as a response to an applied electric field. The supplementary Figure S4 shows the strain % versus polarization graph of BCST-4 ceramics. The Q33 can be calculated by using the following relation , Where S is strain and P is polarization. The obtained maximum Q33 values for BCST-4 ceramics are 0.0434 mE^{4}/CE^{2}. The comparative Q33, kp, d33, d33* , and strain% results are shown in. An excellent value of Q33 is useful for electromechanical actuator applications. The cylindrical pellet of thickness 6.2 mm and diameter 9 mm is prepared to measure the temperature-dependent DC strain (\u03b5) of BCST-4 ceramic in two different modes viz. \u03b533 mode (i.e. the length of the strain gauge is parallel to the thickness) and \u03b531 mode (i.e. the length of the strain gauge is perpendicular to the thickness). shows the schematic representation for DC strain measurement. The electric field is parallel to the length of the strain gauge in \u03b533 mode while in \u03b531 mode, the applied electric field is perpendicular to the length of the strain gauge. The DC strain is expressed in equation form as, Where \u03b5 is DC strain, R is gauge resistance, \u0394R is changing in resistance, and GF is the gauge factor of strain gauge. (a,b) shows the temperature-dependent DC strain versus the applied voltage graph of BCST-4 ceramic in \u03b533 mode and \u03b531 mode. The DC strain measurements were systematically carried out by varying the applied voltage from 250 V to 1850 V in both \u03b533 and \u03b531 modes. The temperature-dependent strain measurements were recorded from 30 \xbaC to 50 \xbaC in the step of 5 \xbaC. It is observed that the DC strain shows the linear response with applied electric field in both modes i.e. DC strain increases with increasing the electric field and decreases with decrease in electric field. During the actual measurement, in \u03b533 mode, the data logger shows negative DC strain values due to the elongation of the length of the strain gauge. The maximum obtained strain in \u03b533 mode is 130 \u03bc\u03b5 for an applied voltage of 1850 V. Moreover, with increasing temperature from 30 \xbaC to 50 \xbaC, the DC strain decreases from 130 \u03bc\u03b5 to 100 \u03bc\u03b5. However, in \u03b531 mode, the data logger shows positive DC strain values due to the contraction of the length of the strain gauge. The maximum value of DC strain is 188 \u03bc\u03b5 in \u03b531 mode for an applied voltage of 1850 V. In \u03b531 mode, the DC strain values decrease from 188 \u03bc\u03b5 to 146 \u03bc\u03b5 with increasing temperature from 30 \xbaC to 50 \xbaC. The DC strain values are maximum in \u03b531 mode as compared to \u03b533 mode which is shown in c). Self-powered generators known as piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) are used in a wide range of industrial, medicinal, and defence piezoelectric devices like powering IoT devices, transducers, actuators, and sonar. To attain the high energy harvesting response, a significant improvement in the transduction rate (figure of merit) d33 \xd7 g33 is required , where g33 is the piezoelectric voltage constant and is calculated by using the following formula :  The calculated g33 values for BCST-1 to BCST-5 are 8.95, 9.12, 8.35, 6.48, 1.46 (\xd7 10E^{\u22123} Vm/N) respectively. The d33 \xd7 g33 values for all BCST ceramics are tabulated in. The BCST-4 ceramics shows the highest figure of merit (2.93\xd710E^{\u221212} mE^{2}/N) among all. Therefore, the PEH of BCST-4 ceramic is used for energy harvesting measurements to estimate the power generation characteristic. and supplementary Figure S5 shows the open circuit output voltage generated by tapping. The various load resistances from 50 k\u03a9 to 1 M\u03a9 were used to measure output voltage response with time. The highest open circuit output voltage of 28 V (peak to peak) is reached in the PEH fabricated by BCST-4 ceramics. It is observed that with the increasing load resistance, the output voltage increased from 4.40 V to 25.5 V and the output current decreased from 88 \xb5A to 25.5 \xb5A. The optimal power value of 1.03 mW was attained at 350 k\u03a9 resistive load, which corresponded to the energy harvester's internal impedance. Furthermore, the computed power density for BCST-4 ceramics is 13.5 \xb5W/mmE^{3}. (Volume of sample = 76.17 mmE^{3}, Area = 61.93 mmE^{2}, Thickness = 1.23 mm). To validate the realistic practical implementation of BCST-4 PEH, 40 red commercial light-emitting diodes (LEDs) consisting of the symbol \u2018SPPU\u2019 and a full wave bridge rectifier were assembled using the circuit depicted in. Tapping on BCST-4 PEH converts mechanical energy into electrical energy and successfully glows 40 LEDs. The energy harvesting performance of BCST-4 PEH indicates that BCST-4 ceramic has great potential in device applications.

The (Ba1-xCax)(SnyTi1-y)O3 (where x=0.016, y=0.024; x=0.032, y=0.048; x=0.048, y=0.072; x=0.064, y=0.096; x=0.08, y=0.12; abbreviated BCST-1; BCST-2; BCST-3; BCST-4; and BCST-5 respectively) piezoelectric ceramics were made using metal oxides and carbonates by a solid-state reaction process. Raw ingredients included Barium Carbonate (BaCO3), Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3), Tin Oxide (SnO2), and Titanium Oxide (TiO2), all of which are 99 % pure analytical grade reagents from Sigma Aldrich. The stoichiometric ratio was used to weigh each powder, and the mixture was wet milled for 24 hours in ethanol medium using polyethylene bottles containing zirconia balls stabilized with yttria. The milled precursors were calcined at 1200 \xbaC for 4 hours in a zirconia crucible after being dried in an oven at 80 \xbaC overnight. The combined powders were then pelletized into disc-shaped samples using a 5 wt.% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) binder. At a heating rate of 2 \xbaC per minute, the sintering was carried out for 4 hours at 1450 \xbaC. After polishing the sintered pellets on silicon carbide paper, pellets were coated with silver paint on both sides and allowed to dry for 30 minutes at 600 \xbaC to facilitate electrical measurement. The crystal structure and phase identification of sintered ceramics were examined by an X-ray diffractometer (D8 Advanced, Bruker Inc., Germany) using Cu K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb= 1.5406 \xc5). The Raman effect measurements were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw In Via microscope Raman) using a He-Ne laser of 532 nm in the range of 100 cmE^{\u22121} to 1000 cmE^{\u22121}. The microstructure and compositional analysis were determined by using a scanning electron microscope (JEOL-JSM 6306 A) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) spectrometer attachment (Oxford Instrument). The temperature-dependent dielectric measurements were carried out by using a PSM 1735 (10\u03bcHz \u2013 35 MHz, Newtons4th Ltd, UK) impedance analyzer. A P-E loop tracer (Marine India, New Delhi, India) was used to record the polarisation versus electric field (P-E) hysteresis loops at an applied frequency of 50 Hz. The converse piezoelectric effect and electrostrictive analysis were conducted by measuring the electric field-induced strain using a ferroelectric test instrument (TF Analyzer 2000 of M/s. aixAcct Systems, GmbH, Germany). The temperature-dependent DC strain measurement was carried out by using a strain gauge (gauge factor 2.07 \xb11 %, gauge resistance 350 \xb11 \u03a9, and gauge length 3 mm), digital handheld data logger (TC32K; TYPE S-2770, Tokyo Sokki Kenkyojo Co. Ltd.) and high voltage regulated DC power supply (JOMA, VS3K05P). The piezoelectric coefficient (d33) was measured using a d33 meter Berlincourt meter (PiezoMeter System PM 300, Piezotest Pte Ltd.) at 110 Hz with an applied force of 250 mN, the piezoelectric charge coefficient, or d33, of electrically poled ceramics was determined. According to IEEE standards for piezoelectric characterizations, the electromechanical coupling coefficient of radial vibration mode, kp was determined using the resonance and anti-resonance method on a PSM 1735 (10\u03bcHz \u2013 35 MHz, Newtons4th Ltd, UK) impedance analyzer.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of BCST-1, BCST-2, BCST-3, BCST-4, and BCST-5 sintered ceramics recorded at room temperature. The XRD pattern shreds of evidence that all BCST ceramics possess pure perovskite structure without any traces of impurity, suggesting CaE^{2+} and SnE^{4+} are well diffused into the host lattice of BaTiO3 at the A-site and B-site respectively. The background was refined by using a 12-coefficient Fourier-cosine series. The refinement method uses a least square approach to refine the scale coefficients, B-factor coefficients, cell parameters (a, b, c, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3), FWHM parameters (U, V, W), shape parameters, zero coefficients, and displacement coefficients. Refinement analysis reveals that the BCST-1, BCST-2, and BCST-3 ceramics exhibit Amm2 and P4mm space groups having orthorhombic and tetragonal crystal symmetries respectively at room temperature. The phase % contribution for the tetragonal (P4mm) crystal structure is more than the orthorhombic (Amm2) crystal structure for BCST-1 to BCST-3 ceramics. The BCST-4 ceramic possesses Amm2, P4mm, and R3m space groups having orthorhombic, tetragonal, and rhombohedral crystal symmetries with phase percentage contributions are 25.42 %, 37.17 %, and 37.41 % respectively, suggesting R-O-T multiphase coexistence at room temperature. It is observed that BCST-4 ceramic contains more contribution of rhombohedral phase (R3m) than orthorhombic (Amm2) and tetragonal (P4mm) phase. Further increasing CaE^{2+} and SnE^{4+} content for BCST-5 ceramic shows a phase coexistence of tetragonal (P4mm) and cubic (Pm3m) crystal structure at room temperature. The \u03c7E^{2} value for all samples is less than 5 indicating the good agreement between the calculated and observed pattern. To determine the stability of the perovskite structure (ABO3), Goldschmidt defined the tolerance factor (t) as , Where RA, RB, and RO are the ionic radii of the A-site ion, B-site ion, and O ion respectively. For oxygen ion (OE^{2-}), the ionic radius is 1.40 \xc5. The calculated values of the tolerance factor are 1.0615, 1.0589, 1.0562, 1.0535, and 1.0509 respectively. It is observed that for all samples, the value of the tolerance factor decreases with increasing concentration of CaE^{2+} and SnE^{4+}content at A-site and B-site respectively. This is because of the substitution of smaller ion radius CaE^{2+} (ionic radius is 1.33 \xc5) for BaE^{2+} (ionic radius is 1.61 \xc5) at 12-fold coordinated site i.e. A-site and larger ion radius SnE^{4+} (ionic radius is 0.69 \xc5) for TiE^{4+} (ionic radius is 0.605 \xc5) at 6-fold coordinated site i.e. The \u2018t\u2019 value less than 0.9 or higher than 1.1 indicates an unstable perovskite structure. All ceramics have \u2018t\u2019 values in the range between 1.05 and 1.06 indicating stable perovskite structure. The tetragonality i.e. c/a ratio is estimated for all BCST samples from Rietveld data. The c/a ratio of all BCST samples shows a similar decreasing trend with the tolerance factor, which is in the range of 1.008\u20131.005 exhibiting high tetragonality (see ). shows the Raman spectra of BCST-1, BCST-2, BCST-3, BCST-4, and BCST-5 ceramics at room temperature measured in the frequency range of 100 cmE^{\u22121} to 1000 cmE^{\u22121}. The unit cell of the ABO3 perovskite structure contains five atoms with 15 degrees of freedom which belongs to the 4 F1 u + F2 u irreducible representation. There exist 12 optical vibrational modes that belong to 3 F1 u + F2 u representations while the remaining one of the symmetry modes F1 u corresponds to the acoustic branch. Each F1 u mode is split into A1 mode and E mode and each F2 u mode splits into B1 mode and E mode when transforming from Pm3m (cubic) to P4mm (tetragonal) phase and has C4\u028b symmetry. The A1 phonon modes and E phonon modes are both Raman and infrared active while the B1 phonon mode is only Raman active in both the P4mm and Pm3m (cubic) phases. The A1 phonon modes and E phonon modes further split into a pair of modes viz. transverse optical (TO) and longitudinal optical (LO) due to the presence of long-range electrostatic forces induced between the ions. The BCST-1, BCST-2, BCST-3, BCST-4, and BCST-5 ceramics consist of sharp distinctive peaks of a perovskite ferroelectric phase at around 296 cmE^{\u22121} and broad peaks at around 520 cmE^{\u22121} and 724 cmE^{\u22121} which corresponds to E(TO2), A1(TO3)/E(TO), and A1(LO3)/E(LO3) vibrational modes respectively. The sharp peak around wavenumber 296 cmE^{\u22121} is the characteristic peak of the tetragonal (P4mm) phase. Hence, all BCST ceramics exhibit a tetragonal (P4mm) phase. Moreover, the interference due to anharmonic coupling between three A1(TO) phonons is related to the appearance of dip at 176 cmE^{\u22121}. The BCST-1, BCST-2, and BCST-3 ceramics consist of a sharp dip in the region around 176 cmE^{\u22121} which gradually weakens with increasing concentration of CaE^{2+} and SnE^{4+} content for BCST-4 and BCST-5 ceramics. The weakening of the dip at 176 cmE^{\u22121} indicates the reduction of coupling between A1(TO) vibrational modes. Pokorny et. al. and Zheng et. al. reported the presence of A1 g octahedral breathing mode at around 800 cmE^{\u22121} which is related to cation disorder and non-random distributions of ions at B-site. For simple perovskites, the A1 g octahedral breathing mode is Raman inactive. However, the A1 g octahedral breathing mode is Raman active in complex perovskite and solid solutions with two or more B-site ceramics. The A1 g octahedral breathing mode is observed for compositions where the CaE^{2+} ion sits at the Ti site. shows no evidence of any mode for all BCST ceramics in the region around 800 cmE^{\u22121} which corresponds to A1 g octahedral breathing mode. The absence of A1 g octahedral breathing mode in Raman spectra confirms that the CaE^{2+} ion is well diffused into the Ba-site of (Ba1-xCax) (SnyTi1-y) O3 perovskite structure without any short-range cation disorder. It is well known that during polymorphic phase transition, the region between 100 cmE^{\u22121} to 300 cmE^{\u22121} is most affected in Raman spectra. The changes seen in this region are mainly related to polar BO6 vibrations that are associated with the orthorhombic (Amm2) phase and Rhombohedral (R3m) phase. The BCST-1, BCST-2, BCST-3, and BCST-4 ceramics consist of vibrational mode A1(TO2) has a vibrational frequency near 230 cmE^{\u22121} for the orthorhombic (Amm2) phase and it shifts to 267 cmE^{\u22121} for the tetragonal (P4mm) phase i.e. for BCST-5 ceramics. Xiao et. al. designated the A1(LO1) mode to the vibration band near 191 cmE^{\u22121}. Perry and Hall studied the Raman spectra of pure BaTiO3 revealing that the vibrational mode A1(LO1) only exists in the orthorhombic (Amm2) phase and rhombohedral (R3m) phase and vanishes in the tetragonal (P4mm) and Cubic (Pm3m) phase. The BCST-1, BCST-2, BCST-3, and BCST-4 ceramics exhibit A1(LO1) mode to the vibration band near 191 cmE^{\u22121} and vanishes for BCST-5 ceramics indicating the existence of tetragonal (P4mm) and cubic (Pm3m) phase for BCST-5 ceramics. Moreover, for BCST-4 composition, the three vibrational modes viz. E(TO1), A1(LO1) and A1(TO1) corresponding to three peaks at frequencies 106 cmE^{\u22121}, 155 cmE^{\u22121} and 191 cmE^{\u22121} respectively are observed which is characteristic of the rhombohedral (R3m) phase.These observations of vibrational modes A1(LO1) and A1(TO1) suggest that BCST1, BCST-2, and BCST-3 compositions have a co-existence of tetragonal (P4mm) and orthorhombic (Amm2) phase and BCST-4 composition has a multiphase co-existence of tetragonal (P4mm), orthorhombic (Amm2), and rhombohedral (R3m) phases at room temperature. However, BCST-5 ceramics exhibit the coexistence of tetragonal (P4mm) and cubic (Pm3m) crystal structures at room temperature. Raman results and Rietveld results for all (Ba1-xCax) (SnyTi1-y)O3 compositions are well matched with each other confirming the corresponding phases for all samples. ) shows the SEM images of BCST-1, BCST-2, BCST-3, BCST-4, and BCST-5 ceramics with the inset of grain size distribution sintered at 1450\xb0C for 4 hours. All BCST ceramics show a fingerprint-like morphology with significant enhancement in grain size (> 70 \xb5m) shown in supplementary Figure S1. This substantial enhancement in grain size for BCST ceramics is attributed to an increase in the domain size. The average grain size of all BCST ceramics was calculated using Image J software by averaging at least more than 100 grains and values for all ceramics are tabulated in. The BCST-1 and BCST-2 ceramics show a large average grain size of about 90.89 \xb5m and 97.90 \xb5m respectively, which decreases monotonously to 70.43 \xb5m for BCST-4 ceramics and again increases for BCST-5 ceramics as SnE^{4} E^{+} content increases. The dense microstructure was observed for all ceramics; however, inhomogeneous grain distributions were observed for all ceramics except BCST-4 ceramic. The BCST-4 ceramics possess optimal diffuse phase transition revealing homogeneous grain distribution. For BCST-4 ceramics domain wall motion is relatively easier and regular due to the uniform grain distribution. Moreover, the BCST-4 exhibits a smaller domain width which specifies the lesser area of the domain wall. The movement of the 90\xb0 domain wall is responsible for piezoelectric properties. With the decrease in grain size, the 90\xb0 domain width decreases. The smaller area domain walls rotate more conveniently and respond progressively to external electrical signals attributing enhancement in piezoelectric properties of BCST-4 ceramic. The density measurement was carried out by using a density meter in xylene medium (density of xylene = 0.86 g/cmE^{3}). The relative density is highest (98.17 %) for BCST-4 ceramics because of their homogeneous grain distribution in the microstructure. The experimental, theoretical, and relative densities for all ceramics are tabulated in. ) shows the EDS spectra for BCST ceramics which confirm the existence of Ba, Ca, Sn, Ti, and O elements in (Ba1-xCax) (SnyTi1-y)O3 ceramics. shows the temperature dependence of dielectric constant for BCST-1, BCST-2, BCST-3, BCST-4, and BCST-5 ceramics measured at 1 kHz, 10 kHz, 100 kHz, and 1 MHz frequencies respectively between the temperature range of \u2212150\xbaC to 150\xbaC. All ceramics exhibit polymorphic phase transition (PPT) behavior. For BCST-1, BCST-2, BCST-3, and BCST-4 ceramics, the three pronounced dielectric peaks are associated with three ferroelectric transitions viz. rhombohedral to orthorhombic (TR-O), orthorhombic to tetragonal (TO-T) and tetragonal to cubic (TT-C) are observed. For BCST-5 ceramic, the three-phase transition peaks merge into one broad peak at Tc, which is caused by replacing TiE^{4+} with SnE^{4+} at the B site. The Curie temperature (Tc) is about 112\xbaC for BCST-1 ceramic. The linear decline of Curie temperature (Tc) was observed in all BCST ceramics. Tc drops to room temperature (Tc \u223c 28 \xbaC) for BCST-5 ceramics. The non-ferroelectric SnO6 octahedra enters the matrix of the ferroelectric phase due to the substitution of SnE^{4+} in the place of TiE^{4+}. The non-ferroelectric regions disrupt the long-range order of the TiO6 ferroelectric octahedra, causing unstable off-center displacements of SnE^{4+} atoms and oxygen ligands, which lead to lowering Tc. All BCST ceramics possess moderate dielectric constant values \u223c >10000. The dielectric constant (\u03b5r) value for all BCST ceramics increases with increasing SnE^{4+}. An extortionate dielectric constant value for BCST-4 (\u03b5r \u223c17414) and BCST-5 (\u03b5r \u223c19914) ceramics was observed. The Curie temperature (Tc) and dielectric constant (\u03b5r) values are listed in. The relation between diffuse phase transition and temperature which is given by modified Curie-Wiess law , Where \u03b5m is the maximum dielectric constant value at Tc, Tm is the temperature at a maximum dielectric constant, \u03b3 is diffuseness and C is the Curie-Wiess constant. Phase transition is given by \u03b3 value. If \u03b3 = 1, the material exhibits normal ferroelectric phase transition i.e. materials follow normal Curie-Wiess law. \u03b3 = 2 describes the relaxor behavior of the material and 1 < \u03b3 < 2 denotes a diffuse phase transition of the material. shows the graph of ln[1/\u03b5r - 1/\u03b5m] versus ln[T - Tm] graph of all BCST ceramics at the applied frequency 1 kHz were plotted to find out the \u03b3 value of ceramics. The calculated \u03b3 values for BCST ceramics are tabulated in. The \u03b3 values lie in the range between 1.34 and 1.70 indicating all BCST ceramics exhibit diffuse phase transition. The \u03b3 value increases for BCST-1 to BCST-4 ceramics suggesting that phase transition becomes more diffuse with increasing SnE^{4+} substitution, but with further increasing SnE^{4+}, for BCST-5 ceramic \u03b3 value decreases. As analyzed above, the incorporation of SnE^{4+} has a significant effect on diffuse phase transition behavior. A series of graphs of 1/\u03b5r versus temperature at applied frequency 1 kHz is shown in and the graph for other said frequencies 10 kHz,100 kHz, and 1 MHz for all ceramics are shown in Supplementary Figure S2 (a-e). As the content of CaE^{2+} and SnE^{4+} increases, the first two transitions i.e. TR-O and TO-T for BCST-1 and BCST-4 ceramics become closer and disappear for BCST-5 ceramics. These results indicate that TR-O and TO-T phases tend to merge for BCST-4 ceramics. So, BCST-4 ceramics have R-O-T multiphase coexistence at room temperature which is also confirmed by Rietveld refinement as mentioned in XRD analysis as well as Raman analysis. For BCST-5 ceramics all peaks merge and show only one transition TT-C. The deviation from the Curie-Weiss law is given by parameter \u2206Tm, which is calculated by the following equation : Where Tcw is Curie-Weiss temperature and Tm is the temperature at a maximum dielectric constant. The calculated \u2206Tm values of BCST-1 to BCST-5 at applied frequency 1 kHz are 6 \xb0C,5 \xb0C,8 \xb0C, 9 \xb0C, and 7 \xb0C respectively. The higher \u0394Tm value is associated with higher \u03b3 values. Therefore, in all BCST ceramics, it is found that \u2206Tm and \u03b3 values show an identical trend, which is shown in  a-e) shows the room temperature Polarization versus Electric field graph (P-E) of BCST-1, BCST-2, BCST-3, BCST-4 and BCST-5 ceramics at frequency 50 Hz. The electric breakdown strength (BDS) is 41.06 kV/cm for BCST-1, 33.20 kV/cm for BCST-2, 35.36 kV/cm for BCST-3, 53.64 kV/cm for BCST-4 and 50.81 kV/cm for BCST-5 ceramics. The BCST-4 ceramics exhibit higher breakdown strength (BDS) i.e. 53.81 kV/cm. The higher breakdown strength for BCST-4 ceramic is due to its uniform and dense microstructure. It is observed that the polarization hysteresis loop tends to become slim with increasing CaE^{2+} and SnE^{4+} content. The value of Ec for BCST-1 ceramics is in the range of 3.48 kV/cm to 4.84 kV/cm which further decreases for BCST-5 ceramics in the range between 1.24 kV/cm to 1.70 kV/cm. For BCST-4 ceramics the lower value of Ec (\u2053 in the range between 1.82 kV/cm to 2.48 kV/cm) is due to R-O-T multiphase coexistence. The BCST-4 ceramics possess a major contribution of the rhombohedral phase (37.41 %), with the orthorhombic (25.42 %) and tetragonal phase (37.17 %) i.e R-O-T multiphase, revealing that the polarization vector easily rotates without having to overcome the significant energy barrier and effectively improves the piezoelectric properties. As the P-E loop is recorded at room temperature, therefore the lower value of Ec for BCST-5 ceramics is due to its lower Tc (28 \xb0C). Moreover, Pr values for BCST ceramics are varied by the substitution of CaE^{2+} and SnE^{4+} concentration, which results from distinct structural changes. The energy storage density for all BCST ceramics is calculated from the P-E hysteresis loop by using the following relation , Where Pr is remnant polarization, Pm is maximum polarization and E is the applied electric field. The energy storage efficiency(\u019e) is calculated by the following relation,  The Wrec of BCST-1, BCST-2, BCST-3, BCST-4, and BCST-5 is 109.49 mJ/cmE^{3}, 86.84 mJ/cmE^{3}, 102.03 mJ/cmE^{3}, 165.87 mJ/cmE^{3,} and 110.89 mJ/cmE^{3} respectively shown in. All BCST ceramics have efficiency in the range of 38.45\u201373.94 %. The obtained maximum energy storage value is 165.87 mJ/cmE^{3} for BCST-4 ceramics with an efficiency of 68.00 %. Hence, BCST-4 ceramics is a promising candidate for energy storage applications. The temperature-dependent P-E measurement of all (Ba1-xCax)(SnyTi1-y)O3 ceramics are carried out near their curie temperature to check the temperature stability ferroelectric properties of the ceramics is shown in Figure S3 (a-e). It is observed that all BCST ceramics exhibit the stable typical ferroelectric hysteresis even at higher temperatures showing good thermal stability. shows the frequency-dependent impedance (|Z|) and phase angle (\u03b8) for electrically poled BCST-1, BCST-2, BCST-3, BCST-4, and BCST-5 ceramics. Poling is essential to induce piezoelectric response to any ferroelectric material by application of the DC electric field. The poling of all BCST ceramics has been done under the DC voltage equal to their coercive field for 30 minutes at room temperature in a silicon oil bath to avoid electrical breakdown through air. The degree of poling in the ceramics is estimated from phase angle (\u03b8). All BCST ceramics show phase angle values in the range between 52\xb0 to 65\xb0 except BCST-5 ceramic. The BCST-5 ceramics have a lower curie temperature (Tc = 28\xb0C), consequently, it is difficult to pole at room temperature as its crystal structure changes from tetragonal to cubic causing the lowest value of \u03b8 = 4\xb0 at room temperature. For the measurement of the electromechanical coupling coefficient of radial vibration mode, kp, the disk-shaped pellet of thickness 1.23 mm and the diameter of electrode area 8.88 mm was used. All the BCST ceramics show kp more than 0.40 except BCST-5 ceramic due to its lower value of \u03b8. The higher value of kp = 0.45 is obtained for BCST-4 ceramics and is attributed to the R-O-T multiphase coexistence, which favors an easier motion of domain. The increment in the kp for BCST-4 ceramics indicates the sample is easier to pole and has easy polarization rotation, which effectively enhanced the piezoelectric properties for BCST-4 ceramics. All BCST ceramics possess the d33 value > 250 pC/N. The \u03b8, kp, and d33 values for all ceramics are tabulated in. The d33 value increases from BCST-1 ceramic to BCST-4 ceramic and again decreases for BCST-5 ceramic. The d33 = 452 pC/N is obtained for BCST-4 ceramics which is more than commercially available soft PZT (d33 = 370pC/N). The enhanced piezoelectric charge constant for BCST-4 ceramics is due to R-O-T multiphase coexistence at room temperature. Also, the decrease in Ec value contributes to the high piezoelectric constant (d33) as mentioned in the ferroelectric section. For BCST-5 ceramic, although it possesses a lower Ec value, its curie temperature (Tc = 28\u2103) is almost equal to room temperature leading its tetragonal crystal structure to transform into a cubic structure above 28\u2103, which will make it difficult to pole causing d33 value decreases to 252 pC/N. The higher piezoelectric charge coefficient with R-O-T multiphase coexistence at room temperature for BCST-4 ceramics with lower Ec value indicates that BCST-4 ceramics is a suitable candidate for lead-free piezoelectric application. So, BCST-4 ceramic is taken for further measurements. The efficiency of BCST-4 ceramics for actuator application is investigated by using a bipolar strain versus electric field (S-E) loop. shows the strain% versus electric field graph at different applied electric fields measured at 1 Hz frequency. The BCST-4 ceramic exhibits a typical butterfly-shaped hysteresis loop. The electric field is applied up to its electrical breakdown strength and it is in the range between 5.62 kV/cm to 22.51 kV/cm. It is observed that with increasing electric field values the strain increases from 0.0365 % (at 5.62 kV/cm) to 0.100 % (at 22.51 kV/cm). For BCST-4 ceramics, the presence of R-O-T multiphase coexistence at room temperature is ascribed to intrinsic contribution, and the lower value of Ec which facilitates easy domain switching is ascribed to extrinsic contribution responsible for obtaining the higher value of strain (0.10 %). The mechanical strain experienced by piezoelectric material per unit of applied electric field is given by quantity d33* (converse piezoelectric coefficient). The d33* for BCST-4 ceramics is measured at the different applied electric fields by using the relation d33* = Smax / Emax. The strain values for BCST-4 samples are > 400 pm/V at the different electric fields. For an electric field of 5.62 kV/cm, the obtained highest d33* value is 649 pm/V and decreases to 444 pm/V for an applied electric field of 22.51 kV/cm. The results indicate that strain increases with increasing electric field but d33* decreases with increasing electric field. The enhancement in strain and d33* for BCST-4 ceramics are due to the dynamic of R-O-T multiphase coexistence at room temperature which offers preferred oriented polarizations over 26 directions (i.e. for R-phase, O-phase, and T-phase there are 8, 12 and 6 directions respectively) and strain variants, making it much easier for different grains to coordinate a collective response. The electrostriction coefficient (Q33) describes the mechanical displacement as a response to an applied electric field. The supplementary Figure S4 shows the strain % versus polarization graph of BCST-4 ceramics. The Q33 can be calculated by using the following relation , Where S is strain and P is polarization. The obtained maximum Q33 values for BCST-4 ceramics are 0.0434 mE^{4}/CE^{2}. The comparative Q33, kp, d33, d33* , and strain% results are shown in. An excellent value of Q33 is useful for electromechanical actuator applications. The cylindrical pellet of thickness 6.2 mm and diameter 9 mm is prepared to measure the temperature-dependent DC strain (\u03b5) of BCST-4 ceramic in two different modes viz. \u03b533 mode (i.e. the length of the strain gauge is parallel to the thickness) and \u03b531 mode (i.e. the length of the strain gauge is perpendicular to the thickness). shows the schematic representation for DC strain measurement. The electric field is parallel to the length of the strain gauge in \u03b533 mode while in \u03b531 mode, the applied electric field is perpendicular to the length of the strain gauge. The DC strain is expressed in equation form as, Where \u03b5 is DC strain, R is gauge resistance, \u0394R is changing in resistance, and GF is the gauge factor of strain gauge. (a,b) shows the temperature-dependent DC strain versus the applied voltage graph of BCST-4 ceramic in \u03b533 mode and \u03b531 mode. The DC strain measurements were systematically carried out by varying the applied voltage from 250 V to 1850 V in both \u03b533 and \u03b531 modes. The temperature-dependent strain measurements were recorded from 30 \xbaC to 50 \xbaC in the step of 5 \xbaC. It is observed that the DC strain shows the linear response with applied electric field in both modes i.e. DC strain increases with increasing the electric field and decreases with decrease in electric field. During the actual measurement, in \u03b533 mode, the data logger shows negative DC strain values due to the elongation of the length of the strain gauge. The maximum obtained strain in \u03b533 mode is 130 \u03bc\u03b5 for an applied voltage of 1850 V. Moreover, with increasing temperature from 30 \xbaC to 50 \xbaC, the DC strain decreases from 130 \u03bc\u03b5 to 100 \u03bc\u03b5. However, in \u03b531 mode, the data logger shows positive DC strain values due to the contraction of the length of the strain gauge. The maximum value of DC strain is 188 \u03bc\u03b5 in \u03b531 mode for an applied voltage of 1850 V. In \u03b531 mode, the DC strain values decrease from 188 \u03bc\u03b5 to 146 \u03bc\u03b5 with increasing temperature from 30 \xbaC to 50 \xbaC. The DC strain values are maximum in \u03b531 mode as compared to \u03b533 mode which is shown in c). Self-powered generators known as piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) are used in a wide range of industrial, medicinal, and defence piezoelectric devices like powering IoT devices, transducers, actuators, and sonar. To attain the high energy harvesting response, a significant improvement in the transduction rate (figure of merit) d33 \xd7 g33 is required , where g33 is the piezoelectric voltage constant and is calculated by using the following formula :  The calculated g33 values for BCST-1 to BCST-5 are 8.95, 9.12, 8.35, 6.48, 1.46 (\xd7 10E^{\u22123} Vm/N) respectively. The d33 \xd7 g33 values for all BCST ceramics are tabulated in. The BCST-4 ceramics shows the highest figure of merit (2.93\xd710E^{\u221212} mE^{2}/N) among all. Therefore, the PEH of BCST-4 ceramic is used for energy harvesting measurements to estimate the power generation characteristic. and supplementary Figure S5 shows the open circuit output voltage generated by tapping. The various load resistances from 50 k\u03a9 to 1 M\u03a9 were used to measure output voltage response with time. The highest open circuit output voltage of 28 V (peak to peak) is reached in the PEH fabricated by BCST-4 ceramics. It is observed that with the increasing load resistance, the output voltage increased from 4.40 V to 25.5 V and the output current decreased from 88 \xb5A to 25.5 \xb5A. The optimal power value of 1.03 mW was attained at 350 k\u03a9 resistive load, which corresponded to the energy harvester's internal impedance. Furthermore, the computed power density for BCST-4 ceramics is 13.5 \xb5W/mmE^{3}. (Volume of sample = 76.17 mmE^{3}, Area = 61.93 mmE^{2}, Thickness = 1.23 mm). To validate the realistic practical implementation of BCST-4 PEH, 40 red commercial light-emitting diodes (LEDs) consisting of the symbol \u2018SPPU\u2019 and a full wave bridge rectifier were assembled using the circuit depicted in. Tapping on BCST-4 PEH converts mechanical energy into electrical energy and successfully glows 40 LEDs. The energy harvesting performance of BCST-4 PEH indicates that BCST-4 ceramic has great potential in device applications.
