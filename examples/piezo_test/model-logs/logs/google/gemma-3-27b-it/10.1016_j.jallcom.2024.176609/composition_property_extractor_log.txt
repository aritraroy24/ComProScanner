# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The XRD patterns of PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics with varying PZ contents at room temperature were illustrated in. The XRD profile of the (200) reflection at an angle of approximately 45\xb0 is illustrated in (b), indicating a coexistence of tetragonal and rhombohedral phases based on the presence of split peaks corresponding to (200) R and (002) T. In order to further study the effect of PZ content on the crystal structure of PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics, all the XRD patterns obtained were Rietveld refined to determine the phase fraction of Mn-doped PNT-xPZ-PT ceramics, as shown in. The phases were analyzed using Rietveld refinement based on the models of R3 m (rhombohedral) and p4 mm (tetragonal) symmetries. The results depicted in demonstrate that the T phase accounted for over 94 % of the composition, indicating its dominance as the primary phase. With an increase in x from 0.41\u20130.44, there was a corresponding decrease in the fraction of T phase from 99.21 % to 94.00 %, while the R phase fraction increased from 0.79 % to 6.00 %. The reliability of the results was confirmed by the fact that R p values are below 15 %, and \u03c7E^{2} are below 4. Based on the XRD refinement result, the R-phase content exhibited a gradual increase with the augmentation of PZ content. The R-phase exhibited a total of 8 distinct directions of spontaneous polarization, whereas the T-phase demonstrates 6 such directions. The observed enhancement of piezoelectric properties could be attributed to the increase in the number of potential spontaneous polarization directions, which progressively expanded during the phase structure evolution towards the R-phase. (a-d) shows the SEM images of PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics, The grain size distribution and average grain size were shown in (e). In addition, the average grain size gradually increases for approximately 5.72\u20136.22 \u03bcm as x increases from 0.41 to 0.43. The findings suggested that the PZ content has obvious impact on the grain size of PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics. The aforementioned changes in microstructure were anticipated to yield exceptional piezoelectric properties, which will be elaborated upon subsequently. shows the temperature dependence of relative dielectric constant (\u025b r) and loss (tan [[___]]#948;) of PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics with different PZ contents measured at 1 kHz, 10 kHz and 100 kHz. When x \u2264 0.43, all figures clearly demonstrate the presence of a single peak in each \u025b r - T curve, which corresponds to the Curie temperature (T m) and signifies the ferroelectric-paraelectric transition point. The T m of the sample (x = 0.41) was approximately 291 \xb0C, while the T m of the sample (x = 0.43) decreased slightly to 284 \xb0C. In contrast, the PNT-0.44PZ-PT-Mn ceramics exhibit two distinct dielectric peaks at approximately 150 \xb0C and 275 \xb0C, respectively. The aforementioned phenomenon supported the XRD findings, wherein an increased proportion of T-phase was observed with the augmentation of PZ content. The dielectric loss (tan [[___]]#948;) were consistently low (approximately 0.4 %) as presented in , which closely resembled that of conventional \u201csoft\u201d PZT actuator ceramics, thereby potentially enhancing the operational longevity of these devices. The insets in (a-d) depicted the linear regression analysis of ln(1/\u03b5 r-1/\u03b5 m) against ln(T-T m), where \u03b3 represented the slope of the regression lines, as determined by / \u03b5 r\u2212/ \u03b5 m= (T\u2212 T m)\u03b3/CE^{1}E^{1}. Where \u025b r was the dielectric constant, \u025b m was the maximum dielectric constant at T m, C was the Curie constant, \u03b3 was the index of diffusion degree, and its value was between 1 (normal ferroelectric) and 2 (complete diffusion phase transition). With the PZ content increasing, \u03b3 increased from 1.59 to 1.76. This may be caused by the strong polarization flexibility enabled polarization rotation through the introduction of PZ, thereby facilitating various B-site ion occupations in the perovskite lattice. The polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loops and current-electric field (I-E) curves of PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics were measured at a frequency of 2 Hz, as depicted in. For the test and analysis of electric properties, the samples were poled by the two methods of the room temperature polarization (under a direct current (DC) field of 3 kV/mm for 15 min at the room temperature) and the high temperature polarization (under a direct current (DC) field of 3 kV/mm for 15 min at 150 \xb0C). The hysteresis loops of unpoled, traditionally poled, and high temperature poled PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics were illustrated in (a-d). The coercive field (E c) remains at a low level (\u223c 10 kV/cm). The dominant influence on E c in PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics was attributed to the presence of large grain sizes, while the electric field strength required for polarization reversal of ferroelectric domains decreases. When x is 0.41, the curve corresponding to the forward and backward switching fields exhibited only two symmetrical peaks, which is consistent with the typical P-E loops observed in pure PMN-PT ceramics. When x \u2265 0.42, the peaks of polarization current density were asymmetrical. It can be inferred that an increase in PZ content results in a higher concentration of defect dipoles, ultimately leading to the generation of a stronger internal bias field and the asymmetry. After high-temperature poling, the electric properties of PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn were d 33 = 400 pC/N, Q m = 757 and d 33 Q m =3.0\xd710E^{5}. The piezoelectric parameters obtained in our work are listed in. (a) presented the variation of d 33 and Q m with respect to the PZ content in PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics. d 33 firstly increased and then decreased, while Q m fluctuated around 750 with increasing PZ content. Meanwhile, the figure of merit (FOM) d 33\xb7Q m was an important factor to evaluate piezoelectric materials, and the maximum FOM obtained was in 3.0\xd710E^{5} PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramics. The figure of merit (FOM) for PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramic reached the same level as PMN-PZT single crystal, rendering it a highly promising candidate for high-power applications. In (b), \u025b r showed a progressive enhancement as the PZ concentration increases, peaking at a maximum value of 1753 when x = 0.42. In contrast, P r demonstrated an upward trend by increasing PZ concentration. Both d 33 and \u025b r\xb7P r exhibited a similar trend, initially increasing until they reach their respective maximum values of d 33 = 400 pC/N and \u025b r\xb7P r =20856 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at x = 0.43. This observation is not unexpected, as the intrinsic piezoelectric and dielectric responses are interconnected through the following mathematical equation d 33 = 2\u025b r \u025b 0 Q 11 P r. Therefore, the high piezoelectric constant d 33 can be attributed to the enhancement in dielectric property and remnant polarization. showed the trend of the electromechanical coupling factor (k p) of PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics as the value of x. The result depicted in (a) demonstrated a significant increase in k p, from initial values of 0.535 at x = 0.41, to maximum values of 0.616 at x = 0.43, respectively. The phase angle above 80\xb0 is observed in (b-e) for all samples, indicating complete poling of the ceramic and facilitating easy domain wall motion for enhanced piezoelectric performance. Compared with PNT-0.41PZ-PT-Mn and PNT-0.44PZ-PT-Mn, the phase angle curve of PNT-0.42PZ-PT-Mn and PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn showed more rectangular. The enhancement of k p can be attributed to the enlarged grain size and PZ content. In comparison to the extrinsic contributions of grain size, PZ content played a pivotal role in electromechanical properties in PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics. To determine the depolarization temperature, the samples were subjected to annealing at various temperatures with a holding time of 10 min. (a) shows the results of piezoelectric constant from the room temperature to 400 \xb0C. The piezoelectric constant of PNT-0.44PZ-PT-Mn ceramics exhibited a significant change at T R-T (150\u2103). Subsequently, there was a sharp drop in the piezoelectric constant to zero upon annealing at T C (275\xb0C). The test result presented in (a) demonstrates that the d 33 of PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramics exhibited a significantly slower decline compared to other ceramics. The exceptional stability of PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramics could be attributed to the presence of MPBs, which mitigated internal stress associated with domain motion, and the enhanced density, which minimizes space charge accumulation. In general, these factors enhanced the fatigue resistance of PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramics. The electromechanical coupling factor stands as a paramount parameter in the realm of piezoelectric ceramics, with its temperature stability holding utmost significance for device applications. (b) showed the temperature dependence of k p for the PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramics. A small decrease of k p occurs when the temperature is higher than 100 \xb0C. When the temperature is higher than 270 \xb0C, changing trend was similar to the d 33. Because PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramics has the optimum electromechanical performance, we show the temperature dependence of impedance of k p measured with respect to temperature from 25 \xb0C to 240 \xb0C in (c). The d 33 and k p values demonstrate a consistent trend across the temperature range from the room temperature to the Curie temperature, indicating the notable thermal stability of PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramics. In summary, PNT-0.42PZ-PT-Mn and PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramics ceramics with enhanced piezoelectric constant (d 33) and mechanical quality factor (Q m). Moreover, the results indicates that PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramics has good temperature stability. This work offered a methodology for enhancing the properties of PZT-based materials.

# INTRODUCTION
Over the past few decades, the most commonly employed piezoelectric materials encompass Lead zirconate titanate Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) ceramics and their derivatives, which exhibit exceptional piezoelectric properties and benefit from well-established fabrication techniques. For high-power devices, both the piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) and mechanical quality factor (Q m) are significant importance. However, researches on PZT based ceramics with high d 33 and Q m is challenging with the mutually hostile relationship. Therefore, it is desirable for enhancing the electric properties and thermal stability of PZT based ceramics. Extensive exploration and investigation have been conducted on multi-component PZT-based systems to cater to diverse application requirements in specific fields. Most of the solid solutions are relaxor ferroelectrics with the general formula PbB'B"O3 , such as PbMg1/3Nb2/3O3 (PMN) , PbNi1/3Nb2/3O3 (PNN) , PbZn1/3Nb2/3O3 (PZN) , PbCo1/3Nb2/3O3 (PCN) and PbNi1/3Ta2/3O3 (PNT). Wang et al. used Ta2O5 as donor dopant to construct R-T MPB and obtained ultra-high piezoelectric d 33 = 1090 pC/N and inverse piezoelectric d 33 *= 1493 pm/V. PbNi1/3Ta2/3O3 (PNT) displays a pure pyrochlore phase and 0.4Pb(Ni1/3Ta2/3)O3-0.6PbTiO3 exhibits a high dielectric property , and it induces lead vacancies by incorporating NiE^{2+} and TaE^{5+} into the B site of PZT, facilitating domain switching and effectively enhancing the piezoelectric performance of the ceramic. Though there is a little literature on the study of PNT-PZT ceramics, this characteristic indicates that PNT-sosoloid presents a promising strategy for optimizing the trade-off between d 33 and T m in appropriate material systems. The desirable characteristics of \u201chard\u201d piezoelectric ceramics, such as low dielectric loss (0.23 %) and high mechanical quality factor (546), are also retained in the case of 0.6 mol% Mn-doped Pb(Sb0.5Nb0.5)0.02Zr0.51Ti0.47O3. The 8 mol% Mn doped PMN-PZT ceramics exhibit a significantly high Q m (1669). For 3 mol% Mn-doped 0.75PMN-0.25PT ceramics, Q m enhances by 1449, internal bias field E i induced by Mn-doping restrict polarization rotation and clamp domain wall motion, which is beneficial for enhancing Q m. The Mn doped Pb(Ni1/3Ta2/3)O3-PbZrO3 -PbTiO3 is designed to further enhance the electrical properties of PZT-based ceramics, offering exciting possibilities for high-power devices. The operational temperatures in these areas can reach as high as 200\u2013300 \xb0C. The Curie temperature (T c) of PZT is 386 \xb0C, with a piezoelectric constant (d 33) of only 223 pC/N. In contrast, the modified Navy-type-VI PZT exhibits significantly improved d 33 and T c values of 593 pC/N and 190 \xb0C, respectively. Similarly, the Navy-type-II PZT demonstrates d 33 and T c values of 374 pC/N and 365 \xb0C. The ternary PIN-PMN-PT piezoelectric ceramics were synthesized, yielding T c, d 33, and k p values of 245 \xb0C, 450 pC/N, and 0.49, respectively. In this paper, MnO2 doped PNT-PZ-PT piezoelectric ceramics with different PZ content were prepared by the solid-state reaction method. The PNT-PZ-PT-Mn ceramics prepared in this study exhibited exceptional piezoelectric properties and mechanical quality, coupled with a relatively elevated Curie temperature for further optimization for high-power applications.

# CONCLUSION
In this work, PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn piezoelectric ceramics employed by different polarization methods were investigated. The PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramics exhibited optimized electrical properties with d 33 = 400 pC/N, Q m = 757, FOM = 3.0\xd710E^{5} pC/N and k p = 0.616 and good temperature stability. This study presented a systematic approach for enhancing the properties of PZT-based materials.

The dielectric loss (tan [[___]]#948;) were consistently low (approximately 0.4 %) as presented in , which closely resembled that of conventional \u201csoft\u201d PZT actuator ceramics, thereby potentially enhancing the operational longevity of these devices. The insets in (a-d) depicted the linear regression analysis of ln(1/\u03b5 r-1/\u03b5 m) against ln(T-T m), where \u03b3 represented the slope of the regression lines, as determined by / \u03b5 r\u2212/ \u03b5 m= (T\u2212 T m)\u03b3/CE^{1}E^{1}. Where \u025b r was the dielectric constant, \u025b m was the maximum dielectric constant at T m, C was the Curie constant, \u03b3 was the index of diffusion degree, and its value was between 1 (normal ferroelectric) and 2 (complete diffusion phase transition). With the PZ content increasing, \u03b3 increased from 1.59 to 1.76. This may be caused by the strong polarization flexibility enabled polarization rotation through the introduction of PZ, thereby facilitating various B-site ion occupations in the perovskite lattice. The polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loops and current-electric field (I-E) curves of PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics were measured at a frequency of 2 Hz, as depicted in. For the test and analysis of electric properties, the samples were poled by the two methods of the room temperature polarization (under a direct current (DC) field of 3 kV/mm for 15 min at the room temperature) and the high temperature polarization (under a direct current (DC) field of 3 kV/mm for 15 min at 150 \xb0C). The hysteresis loops of unpoled, traditionally poled, and high temperature poled PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics were illustrated in (a-d). The coercive field (E c) remains at a low level (\u223c 10 kV/cm). The dominant influence on E c in PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics was attributed to the presence of large grain sizes, while the electric field strength required for polarization reversal of ferroelectric domains decreases. When x is 0.41, the curve corresponding to the forward and backward switching fields exhibited only two symmetrical peaks, which is consistent with the typical P-E loops observed in pure PMN-PT ceramics. When x \u2265 0.42, the peaks of polarization current density were asymmetrical. It can be inferred that an increase in PZ content results in a higher concentration of defect dipoles, ultimately leading to the generation of a stronger internal bias field and the asymmetry. After high-temperature poling, the electric properties of PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn were d 33 = 400 pC/N, Q m = 757 and d 33 Q m =3.0\xd710E^{5}. The piezoelectric parameters obtained in our work are listed in. (a) presented the variation of d 33 and Q m with respect to the PZ content in PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics. d 33 firstly increased and then decreased, while Q m fluctuated around 750 with increasing PZ content. Meanwhile, the figure of merit (FOM) d 33\xb7Q m was an important factor to evaluate piezoelectric materials, and the maximum FOM obtained was in 3.0\xd710E^{5} PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramics. The figure of merit (FOM) for PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramic reached the same level as PMN-PZT single crystal, rendering it a highly promising candidate for high-power applications. In (b), \u025b r showed a progressive enhancement as the PZ concentration increases, peaking at a maximum value of 1753 when x = 0.42. In contrast, P r demonstrated an upward trend by increasing PZ concentration. Both d 33 and \u025b r\xb7P r exhibited a similar trend, initially increasing until they reach their respective maximum values of d 33 = 400 pC/N and \u025b r\xb7P r =20856 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at x = 0.43. This observation is not unexpected, as the intrinsic piezoelectric and dielectric responses are interconnected through the following mathematical equation d 33 = 2\u025b r \u025b 0 Q 11 P r. Therefore, the high piezoelectric constant d 33 can be attributed to the enhancement in dielectric property and remnant polarization. showed the trend of the electromechanical coupling factor (k p) of PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics as the value of x. The result depicted in (a) demonstrated a significant increase in k p, from initial values of 0.535 at x = 0.41, to maximum values of 0.616 at x = 0.43, respectively. The phase angle above 80\xb0 is observed in (b-e) for all samples, indicating complete poling of the ceramic and facilitating easy domain wall motion for enhanced piezoelectric performance. Compared with PNT-0.41PZ-PT-Mn and PNT-0.44PZ-PT-Mn, the phase angle curve of PNT-0.42PZ-PT-Mn and PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn showed more rectangular. The enhancement of k p can be attributed to the enlarged grain size and PZ content. In comparison to the extrinsic contributions of grain size, PZ content played a pivotal role in electromechanical properties in PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics. To determine the depolarization temperature, the samples were subjected to annealing at various temperatures with a holding time of 10 min. (a) shows the results of piezoelectric constant from the room temperature to 400 \xb0C. The piezoelectric constant of PNT-0.44PZ-PT-Mn ceramics exhibited a significant change at T R-T (150\u2103). Subsequently, there was a sharp drop in the piezoelectric constant to zero upon annealing at T C (275\xb0C). The test result presented in (a) demonstrates that the d 33 of PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramics exhibited a significantly slower decline compared to other ceramics. The exceptional stability of PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramics could be attributed to the presence of MPBs, which mitigated internal stress associated with domain motion, and the enhanced density, which minimizes space charge accumulation. In general, these factors enhanced the fatigue resistance of PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramics. The electromechanical coupling factor stands as a paramount parameter in the realm of piezoelectric ceramics, with its temperature stability holding utmost significance for device applications. (b) showed the temperature dependence of k p for the PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramics. A small decrease of k p occurs when the temperature is higher than 100 \xb0C. When the temperature is higher than 270 \xb0C, changing trend was similar to the d 33. Because PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramics has the optimum electromechanical performance, we show the temperature dependence of impedance of k p measured with respect to temperature from 25 \xb0C to 240 \xb0C in (c). The d 33 and k p values demonstrate a consistent trend across the temperature range from the room temperature to the Curie temperature, indicating the notable thermal stability of PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramics. In summary, PNT-0.42PZ-PT-Mn and PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramics ceramics with enhanced piezoelectric constant (d 33) and mechanical quality factor (Q m). Moreover, the results indicates that PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramics has good temperature stability. This work offered a methodology for enhancing the properties of PZT-based materials.

# INTRODUCTION
Over the past few decades, the most commonly employed piezoelectric materials encompass Lead zirconate titanate Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) ceramics and their derivatives, which exhibit exceptional piezoelectric properties and benefit from well-established fabrication techniques. For high-power devices, both the piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) and mechanical quality factor (Q m) are significant importance. However, researches on PZT based ceramics with high d 33 and Q m is challenging with the mutually hostile relationship. Therefore, it is desirable for enhancing the electric properties and thermal stability of PZT based ceramics. Extensive exploration and investigation have been conducted on multi-component PZT-based systems to cater to diverse application requirements in specific fields. Most of the solid solutions are relaxor ferroelectrics with the general formula PbB'B"O3 , such as PbMg1/3Nb2/3O3 (PMN) , PbNi1/3Nb2/3O3 (PNN) , PbZn1/3Nb2/3O3 (PZN) , PbCo1/3Nb2/3O3 (PCN) and PbNi1/3Ta2/3O3 (PNT). Wang et al. used Ta2O5 as donor dopant to construct R-T MPB and obtained ultra-high piezoelectric d 33 = 1090 pC/N and inverse piezoelectric d 33 *= 1493 pm/V. PbNi1/3Ta2/3O3 (PNT) displays a pure pyrochlore phase and 0.4Pb(Ni1/3Ta2/3)O3-0.6PbTiO3 exhibits a high dielectric property , and it induces lead vacancies by incorporating NiE^{2+} and TaE^{5+} into the B site of PZT, facilitating domain switching and effectively enhancing the piezoelectric performance of the ceramic. Though there is a little literature on the study of PNT-PZT ceramics, this characteristic indicates that PNT-sosoloid presents a promising strategy for optimizing the trade-off between d 33 and T m in appropriate material systems. The desirable characteristics of \u201chard\u201d piezoelectric ceramics, such as low dielectric loss (0.23 %) and high mechanical quality factor (546), are also retained in the case of 0.6 mol% Mn-doped Pb(Sb0.5Nb0.5)0.02Zr0.51Ti0.47O3. The 8 mol% Mn doped PMN-PZT ceramics exhibit a significantly high Q m (1669). For 3 mol% Mn-doped 0.75PMN-0.25PT ceramics, Q m enhances by 1449, internal bias field E i induced by Mn-doping restrict polarization rotation and clamp domain wall motion, which is beneficial for enhancing Q m. The Mn doped Pb(Ni1/3Ta2/3)O3-PbZrO3 -PbTiO3 is designed to further enhance the electrical properties of PZT-based ceramics, offering exciting possibilities for high-power devices. The operational temperatures in these areas can reach as high as 200\u2013300 \xb0C. The Curie temperature (T c) of PZT is 386 \xb0C, with a piezoelectric constant (d 33) of only 223 pC/N. In contrast, the modified Navy-type-VI PZT exhibits significantly improved d 33 and T c values of 593 pC/N and 190 \xb0C, respectively. Similarly, the Navy-type-II PZT demonstrates d 33 and T c values of 374 pC/N and 365 \xb0C. The ternary PIN-PMN-PT piezoelectric ceramics were synthesized, yielding T c, d 33, and k p values of 245 \xb0C, 450 pC/N, and 0.49, respectively. In this paper, MnO2 doped PNT-PZ-PT piezoelectric ceramics with different PZ content were prepared by the solid-state reaction method. The PNT-PZ-PT-Mn ceramics prepared in this study exhibited exceptional piezoelectric properties and mechanical quality, coupled with a relatively elevated Curie temperature for further optimization for high-power applications.

# CONCLUSION
In this work, PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn piezoelectric ceramics employed by different polarization methods were investigated. The PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramics exhibited optimized electrical properties with d 33 = 400 pC/N, Q m = 757, FOM = 3.0\xd710E^{5} pC/N and k p = 0.616 and good temperature stability. This study presented a systematic approach for enhancing the properties of PZT-based materials.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The XRD patterns of PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics with varying PZ contents at room temperature were illustrated in. The XRD profile of the (200) reflection at an angle of approximately 45\xb0 is illustrated in (b), indicating a coexistence of tetragonal and rhombohedral phases based on the presence of split peaks corresponding to (200) R and (002) T. In order to further study the effect of PZ content on the crystal structure of PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics, all the XRD patterns obtained were Rietveld refined to determine the phase fraction of Mn-doped PNT-xPZ-PT ceramics, as shown in. The phases were analyzed using Rietveld refinement based on the models of R3 m (rhombohedral) and p4 mm (tetragonal) symmetries. The results depicted in demonstrate that the T phase accounted for over 94 % of the composition, indicating its dominance as the primary phase. With an increase in x from 0.41\u20130.44, there was a corresponding decrease in the fraction of T phase from 99.21 % to 94.00 %, while the R phase fraction increased from 0.79 % to 6.00 %. The reliability of the results was confirmed by the fact that R p values are below 15 %, and \u03c7E^{2} are below 4. Based on the XRD refinement result, the R-phase content exhibited a gradual increase with the augmentation of PZ content. The R-phase exhibited a total of 8 distinct directions of spontaneous polarization, whereas the T-phase demonstrates 6 such directions. The observed enhancement of piezoelectric properties could be attributed to the increase in the number of potential spontaneous polarization directions, which progressively expanded during the phase structure evolution towards the R-phase. (a-d) shows the SEM images of PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics, The grain size distribution and average grain size were shown in (e). In addition, the average grain size gradually increases for approximately 5.72\u20136.22 \u03bcm as x increases from 0.41 to 0.43. The findings suggested that the PZ content has obvious impact on the grain size of PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics. The aforementioned changes in microstructure were anticipated to yield exceptional piezoelectric properties, which will be elaborated upon subsequently. shows the temperature dependence of relative dielectric constant (\u025b r) and loss (tan [[___]]#948;) of PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics with different PZ contents measured at 1 kHz, 10 kHz and 100 kHz. When x \u2264 0.43, all figures clearly demonstrate the presence of a single peak in each \u025b r - T curve, which corresponds to the Curie temperature (T m) and signifies the ferroelectric-paraelectric transition point. The T m of the sample (x = 0.41) was approximately 291 \xb0C, while the T m of the sample (x = 0.43) decreased slightly to 284 \xb0C. In contrast, the PNT-0.44PZ-PT-Mn ceramics exhibit two distinct dielectric peaks at approximately 150 \xb0C and 275 \xb0C, respectively. The aforementioned phenomenon supported the XRD findings, wherein an increased proportion of T-phase was observed with the augmentation of PZ content. The dielectric loss (tan [[___]]#948;) were consistently low (approximately 0.4 %) as presented in , which closely resembled that of conventional \u201csoft\u201d PZT actuator ceramics, thereby potentially enhancing the operational longevity of these devices. The insets in (a-d) depicted the linear regression analysis of ln(1/\u03b5 r-1/\u03b5 m) against ln(T-T m), where \u03b3 represented the slope of the regression lines, as determined by / \u03b5 r\u2212/ \u03b5 m= (T\u2212 T m)\u03b3/CE^{1}E^{1}. Where \u025b r was the dielectric constant, \u025b m was the maximum dielectric constant at T m, C was the Curie constant, \u03b3 was the index of diffusion degree, and its value was between 1 (normal ferroelectric) and 2 (complete diffusion phase transition). With the PZ content increasing, \u03b3 increased from 1.59 to 1.76. This may be caused by the strong polarization flexibility enabled polarization rotation through the introduction of PZ, thereby facilitating various B-site ion occupations in the perovskite lattice. The polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loops and current-electric field (I-E) curves of PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics were measured at a frequency of 2 Hz, as depicted in. For the test and analysis of electric properties, the samples were poled by the two methods of the room temperature polarization (under a direct current (DC) field of 3 kV/mm for 15 min at the room temperature) and the high temperature polarization (under a direct current (DC) field of 3 kV/mm for 15 min at 150 \xb0C). The hysteresis loops of unpoled, traditionally poled, and high temperature poled PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics were illustrated in (a-d). The coercive field (E c) remains at a low level (\u223c 10 kV/cm). The dominant influence on E c in PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics was attributed to the presence of large grain sizes, while the electric field strength required for polarization reversal of ferroelectric domains decreases. When x is 0.41, the curve corresponding to the forward and backward switching fields exhibited only two symmetrical peaks, which is consistent with the typical P-E loops observed in pure PMN-PT ceramics. When x \u2265 0.42, the peaks of polarization current density were asymmetrical. It can be inferred that an increase in PZ content results in a higher concentration of defect dipoles, ultimately leading to the generation of a stronger internal bias field and the asymmetry. After high-temperature poling, the electric properties of PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn were d 33 = 400 pC/N, Q m = 757 and d 33 Q m =3.0\xd710E^{5}. The piezoelectric parameters obtained in our work are listed in. (a) presented the variation of d 33 and Q m with respect to the PZ content in PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics. d 33 firstly increased and then decreased, while Q m fluctuated around 750 with increasing PZ content. Meanwhile, the figure of merit (FOM) d 33\xb7Q m was an important factor to evaluate piezoelectric materials, and the maximum FOM obtained was in 3.0\xd710E^{5} PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramics. The figure of merit (FOM) for PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramic reached the same level as PMN-PZT single crystal, rendering it a highly promising candidate for high-power applications. In (b), \u025b r showed a progressive enhancement as the PZ concentration increases, peaking at a maximum value of 1753 when x = 0.42. In contrast, P r demonstrated an upward trend by increasing PZ concentration. Both d 33 and \u025b r\xb7P r exhibited a similar trend, initially increasing until they reach their respective maximum values of d 33 = 400 pC/N and \u025b r\xb7P r =20856 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at x = 0.43. This observation is not unexpected, as the intrinsic piezoelectric and dielectric responses are interconnected through the following mathematical equation d 33 = 2\u025b r \u025b 0 Q 11 P r. Therefore, the high piezoelectric constant d 33 can be attributed to the enhancement in dielectric property and remnant polarization. showed the trend of the electromechanical coupling factor (k p) of PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics as the value of x. The result depicted in (a) demonstrated a significant increase in k p, from initial values of 0.535 at x = 0.41, to maximum values of 0.616 at x = 0.43, respectively. The phase angle above 80\xb0 is observed in (b-e) for all samples, indicating complete poling of the ceramic and facilitating easy domain wall motion for enhanced piezoelectric performance. Compared with PNT-0.41PZ-PT-Mn and PNT-0.44PZ-PT-Mn, the phase angle curve of PNT-0.42PZ-PT-Mn and PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn showed more rectangular. The enhancement of k p can be attributed to the enlarged grain size and PZ content. In comparison to the extrinsic contributions of grain size, PZ content played a pivotal role in electromechanical properties in PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics. To determine the depolarization temperature, the samples were subjected to annealing at various temperatures with a holding time of 10 min.

Subsequently, there was a sharp drop in the piezoelectric constant to zero upon annealing at T C (275\xb0C). The test result presented in (a) demonstrates that the d 33 of PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramics exhibited a significantly slower decline compared to other ceramics. The exceptional stability of PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramics could be attributed to the presence of MPBs, which mitigated internal stress associated with domain motion, and the enhanced density, which minimizes space charge accumulation.

# INTRODUCTION
Over the past few decades, the most commonly employed piezoelectric materials encompass Lead zirconate titanate Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) ceramics and their derivatives, which exhibit exceptional piezoelectric properties and benefit from well-established fabrication techniques. For high-power devices, both the piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) and mechanical quality factor (Q m) are significant importance. However, researches on PZT based ceramics with high d 33 and Q m is challenging with the mutually hostile relationship. Therefore, it is desirable for enhancing the electric properties and thermal stability of PZT based ceramics. Extensive exploration and investigation have been conducted on multi-component PZT-based systems to cater to diverse application requirements in specific fields. Most of the solid solutions are relaxor ferroelectrics with the general formula PbB'B"O3 , such as PbMg1/3Nb2/3O3 (PMN) , PbNi1/3Nb2/3O3 (PNN) , PbZn1/3Nb2/3O3 (PZN) , PbCo1/3Nb2/3O3 (PCN) and PbNi1/3Ta2/3O3 (PNT). Wang et al. used Ta2O5 as donor dopant to construct R-T MPB and obtained ultra-high piezoelectric d 33 = 1090 pC/N and inverse piezoelectric d 33 *= 1493 pm/V. PbNi1/3Ta2/3O3 (PNT) displays a pure pyrochlore phase and 0.4Pb(Ni1/3Ta2/3)O3-0.6PbTiO3 exhibits a high dielectric property , and it induces lead vacancies by incorporating NiE^{2+} and TaE^{5+} into the B site of PZT, facilitating domain switching and effectively enhancing the piezoelectric performance of the ceramic. Though there is a little literature on the study of PNT-PZT ceramics, this characteristic indicates that PNT-sosoloid presents a promising strategy for optimizing the trade-off between d 33 and T m in appropriate material systems. The desirable characteristics of \u201chard\u201d piezoelectric ceramics, such as low dielectric loss (0.23 %) and high mechanical quality factor (546), are also retained in the case of 0.6 mol% Mn-doped Pb(Sb0.5Nb0.5)0.02Zr0.51Ti0.47O3. The 8 mol% Mn doped PMN-PZT ceramics exhibit a significantly high Q m (1669). For 3 mol% Mn-doped 0.75PMN-0.25PT ceramics, Q m enhances by 1449, internal bias field E i induced by Mn-doping restrict polarization rotation and clamp domain wall motion, which is beneficial for enhancing Q m. The Mn doped Pb(Ni1/3Ta2/3)O3-PbZrO3 -PbTiO3 is designed to further enhance the electrical properties of PZT-based ceramics, offering exciting possibilities for high-power devices. The operational temperatures in these areas can reach as high as 200\u2013300 \xb0C. The Curie temperature (T c) of PZT is 386 \xb0C, with a piezoelectric constant (d 33) of only 223 pC/N. In contrast, the modified Navy-type-VI PZT exhibits significantly improved d 33 and T c values of 593 pC/N and 190 \xb0C, respectively. Similarly, the Navy-type-II PZT demonstrates d 33 and T c values of 374 pC/N and 365 \xb0C. The ternary PIN-PMN-PT piezoelectric ceramics were synthesized, yielding T c, d 33, and k p values of 245 \xb0C, 450 pC/N, and 0.49, respectively. In this paper, MnO2 doped PNT-PZ-PT piezoelectric ceramics with different PZ content were prepared by the solid-state reaction method. The PNT-PZ-PT-Mn ceramics prepared in this study exhibited exceptional piezoelectric properties and mechanical quality, coupled with a relatively elevated Curie temperature for further optimization for high-power applications.

In this work, PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn piezoelectric ceramics employed by different polarization methods were investigated. The PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramics exhibited optimized electrical properties with d 33 = 400 pC/N, Q m = 757, FOM = 3.0\xd710E^{5} pC/N and k p = 0.616 and good temperature stability.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The XRD patterns of PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics with varying PZ contents at room temperature were illustrated in. The XRD profile of the (200) reflection at an angle of approximately 45\xb0 is illustrated in (b), indicating a coexistence of tetragonal and rhombohedral phases based on the presence of split peaks corresponding to (200) R and (002) T. In order to further study the effect of PZ content on the crystal structure of PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics, all the XRD patterns obtained were Rietveld refined to determine the phase fraction of Mn-doped PNT-xPZ-PT ceramics, as shown in. The phases were analyzed using Rietveld refinement based on the models of R3 m (rhombohedral) and p4 mm (tetragonal) symmetries. The results depicted in demonstrate that the T phase accounted for over 94 % of the composition, indicating its dominance as the primary phase. With an increase in x from 0.41\u20130.44, there was a corresponding decrease in the fraction of T phase from 99.21 % to 94.00 %, while the R phase fraction increased from 0.79 % to 6.00 %. The reliability of the results was confirmed by the fact that R p values are below 15 %, and \u03c7E^{2} are below 4. Based on the XRD refinement result, the R-phase content exhibited a gradual increase with the augmentation of PZ content. The R-phase exhibited a total of 8 distinct directions of spontaneous polarization, whereas the T-phase demonstrates 6 such directions. The observed enhancement of piezoelectric properties could be attributed to the increase in the number of potential spontaneous polarization directions, which progressively expanded during the phase structure evolution towards the R-phase. (a-d) shows the SEM images of PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics, The grain size distribution and average grain size were shown in (e). In addition, the average grain size gradually increases for approximately 5.72\u20136.22 \u03bcm as x increases from 0.41 to 0.43. The findings suggested that the PZ content has obvious impact on the grain size of PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics. The aforementioned changes in microstructure were anticipated to yield exceptional piezoelectric properties, which will be elaborated upon subsequently. shows the temperature dependence of relative dielectric constant (\u025b r) and loss (tan [[___]]#948;) of PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics with different PZ contents measured at 1 kHz, 10 kHz and 100 kHz. When x \u2264 0.43, all figures clearly demonstrate the presence of a single peak in each \u025b r - T curve, which corresponds to the Curie temperature (T m) and signifies the ferroelectric-paraelectric transition point. The T m of the sample (x = 0.41) was approximately 291 \xb0C, while the T m of the sample (x = 0.43) decreased slightly to 284 \xb0C. In contrast, the PNT-0.44PZ-PT-Mn ceramics exhibit two distinct dielectric peaks at approximately 150 \xb0C and 275 \xb0C, respectively. The aforementioned phenomenon supported the XRD findings, wherein an increased proportion of T-phase was observed with the augmentation of PZ content. The dielectric loss (tan [[___]]#948;) were consistently low (approximately 0.4 %) as presented in , which closely resembled that of conventional \u201csoft\u201d PZT actuator ceramics, thereby potentially enhancing the operational longevity of these devices. The insets in (a-d) depicted the linear regression analysis of ln(1/\u03b5 r-1/\u03b5 m) against ln(T-T m), where \u03b3 represented the slope of the regression lines, as determined by / \u03b5 r\u2212/ \u03b5 m= (T\u2212 T m)\u03b3/CE^{1}E^{1}. Where \u025b r was the dielectric constant, \u025b m was the maximum dielectric constant at T m, C was the Curie constant, \u03b3 was the index of diffusion degree, and its value was between 1 (normal ferroelectric) and 2 (complete diffusion phase transition). With the PZ content increasing, \u03b3 increased from 1.59 to 1.76. This may be caused by the strong polarization flexibility enabled polarization rotation through the introduction of PZ, thereby facilitating various B-site ion occupations in the perovskite lattice. The polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loops and current-electric field (I-E) curves of PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics were measured at a frequency of 2 Hz, as depicted in. For the test and analysis of electric properties, the samples were poled by the two methods of the room temperature polarization (under a direct current (DC) field of 3 kV/mm for 15 min at the room temperature) and the high temperature polarization (under a direct current (DC) field of 3 kV/mm for 15 min at 150 \xb0C). The hysteresis loops of unpoled, traditionally poled, and high temperature poled PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics were illustrated in (a-d). The coercive field (E c) remains at a low level (\u223c 10 kV/cm). The dominant influence on E c in PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics was attributed to the presence of large grain sizes, while the electric field strength required for polarization reversal of ferroelectric domains decreases. When x is 0.41, the curve corresponding to the forward and backward switching fields exhibited only two symmetrical peaks, which is consistent with the typical P-E loops observed in pure PMN-PT ceramics. When x \u2265 0.42, the peaks of polarization current density were asymmetrical. It can be inferred that an increase in PZ content results in a higher concentration of defect dipoles, ultimately leading to the generation of a stronger internal bias field and the asymmetry. After high-temperature poling, the electric properties of PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn were d 33 = 400 pC/N, Q m = 757 and d 33 Q m =3.0\xd710E^{5}. The piezoelectric parameters obtained in our work are listed in. (a) presented the variation of d 33 and Q m with respect to the PZ content in PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics. d 33 firstly increased and then decreased, while Q m fluctuated around 750 with increasing PZ content. Meanwhile, the figure of merit (FOM) d 33\xb7Q m was an important factor to evaluate piezoelectric materials, and the maximum FOM obtained was in 3.0\xd710E^{5} PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramics. The figure of merit (FOM) for PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramic reached the same level as PMN-PZT single crystal, rendering it a highly promising candidate for high-power applications. In (b), \u025b r showed a progressive enhancement as the PZ concentration increases, peaking at a maximum value of 1753 when x = 0.42. In contrast, P r demonstrated an upward trend by increasing PZ concentration. Both d 33 and \u025b r\xb7P r exhibited a similar trend, initially increasing until they reach their respective maximum values of d 33 = 400 pC/N and \u025b r\xb7P r =20856 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at x = 0.43. This observation is not unexpected, as the intrinsic piezoelectric and dielectric responses are interconnected through the following mathematical equation d 33 = 2\u025b r \u025b 0 Q 11 P r. Therefore, the high piezoelectric constant d 33 can be attributed to the enhancement in dielectric property and remnant polarization. showed the trend of the electromechanical coupling factor (k p) of PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics as the value of x. The result depicted in (a) demonstrated a significant increase in k p, from initial values of 0.535 at x = 0.41, to maximum values of 0.616 at x = 0.43, respectively. The phase angle above 80\xb0 is observed in (b-e) for all samples, indicating complete poling of the ceramic and facilitating easy domain wall motion for enhanced piezoelectric performance. Compared with PNT-0.41PZ-PT-Mn and PNT-0.44PZ-PT-Mn, the phase angle curve of PNT-0.42PZ-PT-Mn and PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn showed more rectangular. The enhancement of k p can be attributed to the enlarged grain size and PZ content. In comparison to the extrinsic contributions of grain size, PZ content played a pivotal role in electromechanical properties in PNT-xPZ-PT-Mn ceramics. To determine the depolarization temperature, the samples were subjected to annealing at various temperatures with a holding time of 10 min. (a) shows the results of piezoelectric constant from the room temperature to 400 \xb0C. The piezoelectric constant of PNT-0.44PZ-PT-Mn ceramics exhibited a significant change at T R-T (150\u2103). Subsequently, there was a sharp drop in the piezoelectric constant to zero upon annealing at T C (275\xb0C). The test result presented in (a) demonstrates that the d 33 of PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramics exhibited a significantly slower decline compared to other ceramics. The exceptional stability of PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramics could be attributed to the presence of MPBs, which mitigated internal stress associated with domain motion, and the enhanced density, which minimizes space charge accumulation. In general, these factors enhanced the fatigue resistance of PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramics. The electromechanical coupling factor stands as a paramount parameter in the realm of piezoelectric ceramics, with its temperature stability holding utmost significance for device applications. (b) showed the temperature dependence of k p for the PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramics. A small decrease of k p occurs when the temperature is higher than 100 \xb0C. When the temperature is higher than 270 \xb0C, changing trend was similar to the d 33. Because PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramics has the optimum electromechanical performance, we show the temperature dependence of impedance of k p measured with respect to temperature from 25 \xb0C to 240 \xb0C in (c). The d 33 and k p values demonstrate a consistent trend across the temperature range from the room temperature to the Curie temperature, indicating the notable thermal stability of PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramics. In summary, PNT-0.42PZ-PT-Mn and PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramics ceramics with enhanced piezoelectric constant (d 33) and mechanical quality factor (Q m). Moreover, the results indicates that PNT-0.43PZ-PT-Mn ceramics has good temperature stability. This work offered a methodology for enhancing the properties of PZT-based materials.

- Include if there is any doping in the composition using '+' sign with the composition, e.g. 'LiNbO3 + 2%wt Mg'
- Don't remove brackets or parentheses from the chemical formula which is already in the composition. Also, sometimes fractions are written before the composition (mostly in ()) for composition mixtures, don't remove them.
- Don't modify the abbreviation from referenced papers unless full composition is not available.
- ALWAYS follow the asked JSON format. DON'T write any extra information such as note points or explanations.
