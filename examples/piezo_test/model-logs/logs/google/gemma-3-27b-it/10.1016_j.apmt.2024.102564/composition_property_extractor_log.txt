# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
AFM images of the surface of Phe-Leu and Leu-Phe films prepared from a solution of dipeptides in methanol using different methods are shown in. Self-drying of the Phe-Leu solution in methanol on the silicon surface yielded extended dendritic structures with a length of 10 to 40 \u03bcm, a. Under the same conditions Leu-Phe forms structures with a length of more than 10 \u03bcm and a width of 1-3 \u03bcm, d. The use of warm air for drying the Phe-Leu dipeptide solution yielded large agglomerates of complex shape with a diameter of 5 to 15 \u03bcm, consisting of smaller particles with a diameter of up to 1 \u03bcm, b. In the case of Leu-Phe the dendritic structures with a length of 5 to 15 \u03bcm are formed, e. The mean square roughness of the film surface on a 20 \xd7 20 \u03bcmE^{2} scan was 1.2\xb10.1 nm. The height of the structures does not exceed 20 nm relative to the film, c. f shows the result of spin-coating of the Leu-Phe solution on a substrate. Spherical structures were found on the film surface, most of which have a diameter of less than 1 \u03bcm, f. On the surface of the Phe-Leu film, after 24 h, elongated crystals up to 10 \u03bcm long, 0.3-0.5 \u03bcm wide and up to 30 nm high were formed, a. Flat crystals with a length of 0.3-0.7 \u03bcm and a width of 0.3 \u03bcm are also present on the surface. Saturation of the Leu-Phe film with methanol vapor for 24 h yielded similar crystals of 300 nm in height, and 1-3 \u03bcm in width, b. Small crystals of about 20 nm in height were also found. These facts are in good agreement with the AFM data obtained,. After 10 minutes of film interaction with methanol vapor, crystals up to 60 nm in height are formed, a. Increasing the saturation time to 30 minutes yielded crystals up to 120 nm in height, b, and after 60 minutes, crystals up to 300 nm in height were observed, c. Previously it was found that well-formed microstructures of L-valyl-L-alanine are formed after the saturation of amorphous film of dipeptide with pyridine vapors during at least 60 minutes. Additionally, the dipeptide structures obtained were characterized by powder X-ray diffractometry (XRPD), , and Raman spectroscopy,. According to the PXRD data, the spin-coating technique allows for obtaining amorphous films of Phe-Leu, a, and Leu-Phe, b, dipeptides on a silicon substrate. Increasing the saturation time of the amorphous dipeptide film to 24 hours leads to the formation of a well-defined crystalline phase. Raman spectra of Phe-Leu crystals grown on a silicon surface were obtained for two scattering geometries that differ in the samples's orientations relative to the polarization of the exciting beam by 90 degrees, a. In the region of 600 \u2013 900 cmE^{-1} both spectra contain 3 peaks at 616 cmE^{-1}, 672 cmE^{-1} and 820 cmE^{-1}, a (blue line). The first one at 616 cmE^{-1} corresponds to the deformation of the N\u2013H bond  and -COOE^{-} group. The peaks at 672 cmE^{-1} correspond to the planar oscillation  and out-of-plane vibration  of the -COOE^{-} group. In the region of 1000 \u2013 1800 cmE^{-1}, the spectra obtained in different scattering geometries differ dramatically. One of the spectra contains only a peak at 1554 cmE^{-1}, which corresponds to planar vibrations of the -CNH bond and vibrations of the -CN- bond. When the sample is rotated relative to the polarization of the exciting beam by 90 degrees, five peaks appear, Fig. (6a red line). These lines correspond to the vibrations of the benzene ring of the Phe-Leu molecule: deformation of HCC-ring (1154 cmE^{-1}), stretching of CC-ring and deformation of CCH-ring (1320 cmE^{-1}), deformation of CCH-ring (1508 cmE^{-1}), and stretching of C=C-ring (1614 cmE^{-1}) bonds , and the \u2212CH2\u2212 moiety connected to the phenyl ring (1256 cmE^{-1}). It should be noted that the broad peak at 928 - 1000 cmE^{-1} corresponds to vibrations of the crystal lattice of the Si substrate, SI. The narrow and intense peak in the region of 736 - 778 cmE^{-1} refers to one of the laser harmonics. As for Phe-Leu spectra there are also peaks at 618, 672, 820, and 1554 cmE^{-1}, which correspond to the oscillations of the described groups. The only difference is the presence of a wide shoulder at 1060 cmE^{-1} that corresponds to the CC stretching of the phenyl ring , b (blue line). To obtain high-quality results by the piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) method, the structures must be below 200 nm and have a well-defined shape. The AFM images (topography) of the structures based on the dipeptides studied are shown in a, a. The images obtained by the PFM method are shown in b-e and 8 b-e. The results of recording the change in the vertical amplitude of cantilever oscillation under the alternating voltage that changes crystal geometric parameters are shown in b and 8 b. The results of recording the change in the vertical phase of cantilever oscillation under the alternating voltage that changes crystal geometric parameters are shown in c and 8 c. The results of recording the change in the horizontal amplitude of cantilever oscillation under the alternating voltage that changes crystal geometric parameters are shown in d and 8 d. The results of recording the change in the horizontal phase of cantilever oscillation under the alternating voltage that changes crystal geometric parameters are shown in e and 8 e. For most structures, the piezoelectric signals are present both on the PFM images corresponding to the vertical oscillations, b, c, and to the lateral oscillations, d, e. Moreover, the magnitude of the scatter of the PFM signal in the amplitude images is close: 50 pA for vertical oscillations, b, and 35 pA for lateral oscillations, d. The results of the PFM study showed that the Leu-Phe crystals also have pronounced piezoelectric properties,. Since the magnitude of the spread of the vertical PFM signal (400 pA), b, exceeds the magnitude of the spread of the lateral PFM signal (80 pA), d, one can assume that the piezoelectric polarization vector is directed predominantly in the vertical direction. The height of Phe-Leu and Leu-Phe crystals was 20 nm \xb1 1 nm and 65 nm \xb1 3 nm, respectively. The phase images are shown in Supplementary Information (SI). The PFM data were used to estimate the values of the effective piezoelectric coefficient using the equation: where s is the deformation, deff \u2013 the effective piezoelectric coefficient, U \u2013 the applied voltage. For Phe-Leu crystal, a, the value of the piezoelectric coefficient was d eff \u2248 71 pm VE^{-1} for vertical displacement, b, and d eff \u2248 -73 pm VE^{-1} for lateral displacement, c. The value of the piezoelectric coefficient for Leu-Phe crystal, a, was d eff \u2248 87 pm VE^{-1} for vertical displacement, b, and d eff \u2248 -19 pm VE^{-1} for lateral displacement, c. The results obtained in this work are comparable with the piezoelectric coefficient determined in the literature for a Phe-Phe nanocrystal formed on an amorphous film, for which d eff = 30 pm VE^{-1} in the lateral direction  and for layered crystals of L,L- and D,D-enantiomers of Phe-Phe, for which d 33 = 20 pm VE^{\u22121}. For the latter, the coefficient d 33 does not exceed 2.5\xb10.3 pC NE^{\u22121} (pm VE^{\u22121}).

# CONCLUSION
The effective piezoelectric coefficients for vertical and lateral displacements were estimated as 71 pm VE^{-1} and -73 pm VE^{-1} for Phe-Leu crystals, and 87 pm VE^{-1} and -19 pm VE^{-1} for Leu-Phe, respectively.
