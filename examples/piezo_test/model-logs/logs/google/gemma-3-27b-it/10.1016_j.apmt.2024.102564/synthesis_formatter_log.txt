Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same.

**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'Drop casting, Spontaneous evaporation, Forced drying with warm air, Spin-coating, Saturation with methanol vapor', 'precursors': ['L-phenylalanyl-L-leucine', 'L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine', 'Methanol'], 'steps': ['10 μL of a freshly prepared dipeptide solution (1 mg mL⁻¹) in methanol was dropped onto a silicon substrate.', 'Solvent removal by spontaneous evaporation.', 'Solvent removal by forced drying with warm air.', 'Solvent removal by spin-coating at 3000 rpm.', 'Silicon substrate with deposited dipeptide film was placed in a Petri dish containing methanol to create saturated vapor (P/P₀ = 1).', 'Petri dish was sealed and kept from 10 minutes to 24 hours at room temperature.', 'Film was dried with warm air (45°C) after saturation.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRPD', 'Raman Spectroscopy', 'AFM', 'PFM']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
