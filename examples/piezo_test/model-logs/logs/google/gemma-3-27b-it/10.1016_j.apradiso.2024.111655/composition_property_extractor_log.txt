# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The TG/DTA curves of mixtures primarily materials of Eu2O3, GeO2, and activators Dy2O3, La2O3 and Ho2O3 was analyzed for the nominal compositions Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7, Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7 over the temperature range of 50 \xb0C\u20131300 \xb0C ( ). The thermal profiles of these compositions are quite similar, as all are based on the Eu2Ge2O7 crystal structure doped with 5 mol% of the activators Dy2O3, La2O3 and Ho2O3. demonstrate that no mass change detected at 50 \xb0C\u20131300 \xb0C. The endothermic peaks observed at 1120 \xb0C in correspond to the phase formation transitions of Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7, Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7, respectively. Firstly pre-sintering stage was applied to powder mixtures at 800 \xb0C for 2 h and secondly the milling mixtures were sintered (1150 \xb0C for 10 h). The XRD analysis were applied after the main sintering stage at 1150 \xb0C. The XRD patterns of Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7, Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7 are shown in. The patterns of Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7, Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7 are agree with PDF card number 00-042-0210 of Eu2Ge2O7 and all XRD patterns have a single phase. Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7, Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7 crystallize in a triclinic system having parameters of a: 18.559 \xc5 b: 6.815 \xc5 c: 6.867 \xc5, \u03b1:88.2\xb0 \u03b2:91.72\xb0 \u03b3:94.58\xb0. a, b and c show SEM images of Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7, Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7, respectively. According to EDX analysis ( a, b and c) the all samples contain no impurity phases. present the emission and excitation luminescence spectrum of Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7, Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7 annealed at 1150 \xb0C. a shows the excitation spectrum within the 200\u2013500 nm range, featuring characteristic bands for EuE^{3+} ions centered at 278 nm (LMCT of EuE^{3+}), (E^{7}F0\u2192E^{5}L6) 392 nm and (E^{7}F0\u2192E^{5}D2) 459 nm. Intense narrow line centered at about 392 nm is due to E^{7}F0 \u2192 E^{5}L6 transition, demonstrates that the investigated material can be efficiently excited by near-ultraviolet (UV) light. The emission spectra reveal four main peaks at (E^{5}D0\u2192E^{7}F1) 595 nm, (E^{5}D0\u2192E^{7}F2) 620 nm, (E^{5}D0\u2192E^{7}F3) 650 nm and (E^{5}D0\u2192E^{7}F4) 703 nm (; ). The Stark components of the magnetic-dipole transition E^{5}D0\u2192E^{7}F1 are observed around 595 nm and are not influenced by the crystal environment. The most intense transition occurs at 620 nm, E^{5}D0\u2192E^{7}F2 transition corresponding to the electric-dipole transition, which is hyper sensitive to the crystal environment of EuE^{3+} ions. Weaker emissions at 650 nm and 703 nm are attributed to the E^{5}D0\u2192E^{7}F3 and E^{5}D0\u2192E^{7}F4 transitions, respectively. The emission and excitation spectra for Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7 (a) are similar to those shown in a. The excitation and emission bands of LaE^{3+}, DyE^{3+} and HoE^{3+} ions were not observed. When the PL results are evaluated in terms of photoluminescence intensity, it is seen that the LaE^{3+} doping plays a major role in increasing the luminescence intensity. In addition, when the host crystal is doped with LaE^{3+}, it is seen that the emission peak around 703 nm increases relatively compared to the intensity of the emission peak around 617 nm, which is the highest intensity. The luminescence decay curves of Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7, Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7 are shown in b. The lifetimes were determined using a fitting curve approach based on the single exponential decay equation: where I represents the emission intensity, \u03c4 1 : the lifetime for the exponential components, t:time, A 1 , C: constants. The decay times (\u03c4 1 ) of the Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7, Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7 phosphors were 16.03 \u03bcs, 20.0 \u03bcs, and 2.006 \u03bcs, respectively. The Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 phosphor exhibits a significantly longer afterglow compared to Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7, indicating that LaE^{3+} ions are crucial for extending the decay times and enhancing both emission and excitation intensity. The samples' diameter (\u2205) and thickness (t) were measured. The relative densities of the samples were obtained by the Archimedes\u2019 method. show the densities and dimensions. The calculated relative densities are >95%. The following equation was used to calculate the dielectric constants (\u0190r). The dielectric constant (\u0190r), capacitance (c), Curie temperature, piezoelectric charge constant (d33) and loss tangent (tan \u03b4) are shown in. The Curie temperature (Tc) of were obtained with a TG/DTA ( ). The first endo-thermic peak in DTA curve indicated that the phase transition occurs in crystal structure. The endotherm at 825, 844 and 838 \xb0C shown the Curie temperature of Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7, Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7, respectively. Considering the effect of doping of HoE^{3+}, LaE^{3+} and DyE^{3+} ions on piezoelectric and dielectric properties; doping HoE^{3+} in Eu2Ge2O7 plays role in high dielectric constant (80.6), whereas high Curie temperature (844 \xb0C) and low loss tangent (0.19%) values could be obtained with LaE^{3+} doped Eu2Ge2O7. DyE^{3+} doping in Eu2Ge2O7 resulted in high piezoelectric charge constant (0.66 pC/N). For example, the Curie temperature of the widely used BaTiO3 (BT) is 100 \xb0C. While Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) offers a higher Curie temperature of 350 \xb0C, its use is limited due to the toxic effects of lead. To mitigate these issues, BiNaTiO3 (BNT) and KNaNbO3 (KNN) have been developed, with Curie temperatures of 200 \xb0C and 400 \xb0C, respectively (; ). In this study, materials with a Curie temperature approximately 2 times greater than commonly used commercial piezoelectric materials have been obtained. Thus, DyE^{3+}, LaE^{3+} and SmE^{3+} ions improve the Curie temperature and the piezoelectric properties when doped in the Eu2Ge2O7 crystal and each material comes to the fore with a different feature.

# ABSTRACT
The Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7, Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7 powder were obtained through a solid-state reaction method via multistep firing of stoichiometric ratios of Eu2O3, GeO2, Dy2O3, La2O3 and Ho2O3 in open atmosphere at temperatures from 800 to 1150 °C. The thermal behaviour, phase formation, SEM/EDX analysis, photoluminescence properties, Curie tempereture, dielectric and piezoelectric properties of the samples were investigated by TG/DTA, XRD, SEM, PL, TG/DTA, LCR-meter and d33-meter, respectively. The germenates having triclinic crystal system have 5D0→7F4, 5D0→7F3, 5D0→7F2, 5D0→7F1 transitions of Eu3+ ions. Also, the photoluminescent germenates show electrical properties and the piezoelectric charge constant of germenates showed Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7> Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7 > Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 trend. The Curie temperature of Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7, Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7 are 825, 844 and 838 °C, respectively. Compared to commonly used piezoelectric materials, Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7, Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7 materials with very high Curie temperatures were obtained with photoluminescent properties.

# INTRODUCTION
Materials with the general formula RE2B2O7 are known for their unique physical properties, such as catalytic activity, ferrimagnetism and ferromagnetism, piezoelectric behavior, giant magneto-resistance, high melting points. In this formula, "B" is a transition metal that can exist in various oxidation states and "RE" refers to a trivalent rare earth ion. Due to these properties, RE2B2O7 compounds are used in a wide range of applications, including, photoluminescent materials, solid oxide fuel cells, dielectric and piezoelectric smart materials, and immobilizers of nuclear waste sources (; ; , , , ). Researchers have shown significant interest in rare-earth germanates, specifically RE2B2O7, where "RE" represents rare earth ions. Despite the growing attention, many properties of RE2B2O7 compounds are still not fully understood. The luminescence of the EuE^{3+} ion has been extensively studied due to its ability to emit light in the visible spectrum. According to the Judd-Ofelt theory, the magnetic dipole transition of EuE^{3+} ions is E^{5}D0\u2192E^{7}F1 transition and does not depend on the asymmetry of the surrounding crystal enviroment. On the other hand, E^{5}D0\u2192E^{7}Fj (j = 2,4,6) transition is the electric dipole transitions which require an asymmetric environment around the EuE^{3+} ion in the unit cell to produce luminescence (; ; ; ; ). Additionally, inorganic functional materials doped with different rare earth ions have attracted significant attention in materials studies due to their unique optical, magnetic and electronic properties, which stem from their 4f electron configurations. For example, the Curie temperature of the widely used BaTiO3 (BT) is 100 \xb0C. While Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) offers a higher Curie temperature of 350 \xb0C, its use is limited due to the toxic effects of lead. To mitigate these issues, BiNaTiO3 (BNT) and KNaNbO3 (KNN) have been developed, with Curie temperatures of 200 \xb0C and 400 \xb0C, respectively. In this context, high Curie temperature Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7, Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7 smart materials were synthesized by the solid state method and characterized.

# CONCLUSION
Our goal was to synthesize and to characterize of the Eu2Ge2O7 activated with DyE^{3+}, LaE^{3+} and HoE^{3+} ions to explore their multifunctional properties. In this context, Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7, Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7 were firstly sythesized with solid state method and characterized them in terms of crystal structure, elemental analysis, surface morphology, photoluminescence, dielectric and piezoelectric properties. The lead-free Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7, Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7 has higher Curie temperature than commercial Pb(ZrxTi1-x)O3 (PZT), Na1- xBixTiO3 (NBT) and BaZr1-xTixO3 (BZT) (; ; ).

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The TG/DTA curves of mixtures primarily materials of Eu2O3, GeO2, and activators Dy2O3, La2O3 and Ho2O3 was analyzed for the nominal compositions Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7, Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7 over the temperature range of 50 \xb0C\u20131300 \xb0C ( ). The thermal profiles of these compositions are quite similar, as all are based on the Eu2Ge2O7 crystal structure doped with 5 mol% of the activators Dy2O3, La2O3 and Ho2O3. demonstrate that no mass change detected at 50 \xb0C\u20131300 \xb0C. The endothermic peaks observed at 1120 \xb0C in correspond to the phase formation transitions of Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7, Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7, respectively. Firstly pre-sintering stage was applied to powder mixtures at 800 \xb0C for 2 h and secondly the milling mixtures were sintered (1150 \xb0C for 10 h). The XRD analysis were applied after the main sintering stage at 1150 \xb0C. The XRD patterns of Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7, Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7 are shown in. The patterns of Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7, Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7 are agree with PDF card number 00-042-0210 of Eu2Ge2O7 and all XRD patterns have a single phase. Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7, Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7 crystallize in a triclinic system having parameters of a: 18.559 \xc5 b: 6.815 \xc5 c: 6.867 \xc5, \u03b1:88.2\xb0 \u03b2:91.72\xb0 \u03b3:94.58\xb0. a, b and c show SEM images of Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7, Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7, respectively. According to EDX analysis ( a, b and c) the all samples contain no impurity phases. present the emission and excitation luminescence spectrum of Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7, Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7 annealed at 1150 \xb0C. a shows the excitation spectrum within the 200\u2013500 nm range, featuring characteristic bands for EuE^{3+} ions centered at 278 nm (LMCT of EuE^{3+}), (E^{7}F0\u2192E^{5}L6) 392 nm and (E^{7}F0\u2192E^{5}D2) 459 nm. Intense narrow line centered at about 392 nm is due to E^{7}F0 \u2192 E^{5}L6 transition, demonstrates that the investigated material can be efficiently excited by near-ultraviolet (UV) light. The emission spectra reveal four main peaks at (E^{5}D0\u2192E^{7}F1) 595 nm, (E^{5}D0\u2192E^{7}F2) 620 nm, (E^{5}D0\u2192E^{7}F3) 650 nm and (E^{5}D0\u2192E^{7}F4) 703 nm (; ). The Stark components of the magnetic-dipole transition E^{5}D0\u2192E^{7}F1 are observed around 595 nm and are not influenced by the crystal environment. The most intense transition occurs at 620 nm, E^{5}D0\u2192E^{7}F2 transition corresponding to the electric-dipole transition, which is hyper sensitive to the crystal environment of EuE^{3+} ions. Weaker emissions at 650 nm and 703 nm are attributed to the E^{5}D0\u2192E^{7}F3 and E^{5}D0\u2192E^{7}F4 transitions, respectively. The emission and excitation spectra for Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7 (a) are similar to those shown in a. The excitation and emission bands of LaE^{3+}, DyE^{3+} and HoE^{3+} ions were not observed. When the PL results are evaluated in terms of photoluminescence intensity, it is seen that the LaE^{3+} doping plays a major role in increasing the luminescence intensity. In addition, when the host crystal is doped with LaE^{3+}, it is seen that the emission peak around 703 nm increases relatively compared to the intensity of the emission peak around 617 nm, which is the highest intensity. The luminescence decay curves of Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7, Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7 are shown in b. The lifetimes were determined using a fitting curve approach based on the single exponential decay equation: where I represents the emission intensity, \u03c4 1 : the lifetime for the exponential components, t:time, A 1 , C: constants. The decay times (\u03c4 1 ) of the Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7, Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7 phosphors were 16.03 \u03bcs, 20.0 \u03bcs, and 2.006 \u03bcs, respectively. The Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 phosphor exhibits a significantly longer afterglow compared to Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7, indicating that LaE^{3+} ions are crucial for extending the decay times and enhancing both emission and excitation intensity. The samples' diameter (\u2205) and thickness (t) were measured. The relative densities of the samples were obtained by the Archimedes\u2019 method. show the densities and dimensions. The calculated relative densities are >95%. The following equation was used to calculate the dielectric constants (\u0190r). The dielectric constant (\u0190r), capacitance (c), Curie temperature, piezoelectric charge constant (d33) and loss tangent (tan \u03b4) are shown in. The Curie temperature (Tc) of were obtained with a TG/DTA ( ). The first endo-thermic peak in DTA curve indicated that the phase transition occurs in crystal structure. The endotherm at 825, 844 and 838 \xb0C shown the Curie temperature of Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7, Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7, respectively. Considering the effect of doping of HoE^{3+}, LaE^{3+} and DyE^{3+} ions on piezoelectric and dielectric properties; doping HoE^{3+} in Eu2Ge2O7 plays role in high dielectric constant (80.6), whereas high Curie temperature (844 \xb0C) and low loss tangent (0.19%) values could be obtained with LaE^{3+} doped Eu2Ge2O7. DyE^{3+} doping in Eu2Ge2O7 resulted in high piezoelectric charge constant (0.66 pC/N). For example, the Curie temperature of the widely used BaTiO3 (BT) is 100 \xb0C. While Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) offers a higher Curie temperature of 350 \xb0C, its use is limited due to the toxic effects of lead. To mitigate these issues, BiNaTiO3 (BNT) and KNaNbO3 (KNN) have been developed, with Curie temperatures of 200 \xb0C and 400 \xb0C, respectively (; ). In this study, materials with a Curie temperature approximately 2 times greater than commonly used commercial piezoelectric materials have been obtained. Thus, DyE^{3+}, LaE^{3+} and SmE^{3+} ions improve the Curie temperature and the piezoelectric properties when doped in the Eu2Ge2O7 crystal and each material comes to the fore with a different feature.

# ABSTRACT
The Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7, Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7 powder were obtained through a solid-state reaction method via multistep firing of stoichiometric ratios of Eu2O3, GeO2, Dy2O3, La2O3 and Ho2O3 in open atmosphere at temperatures from 800 to 1150 °C. The thermal behaviour, phase formation, SEM/EDX analysis, photoluminescence properties, Curie tempereture, dielectric and piezoelectric properties of the samples were investigated by TG/DTA, XRD, SEM, PL, TG/DTA, LCR-meter and d33-meter, respectively. The germenates having triclinic crystal system have 5D0→7F4, 5D0→7F3, 5D0→7F2, 5D0→7F1 transitions of Eu3+ ions. Also, the photoluminescent germenates show electrical properties and the piezoelectric charge constant of germenates showed Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7> Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7 > Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 trend. The Curie temperature of Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7, Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7 are 825, 844 and 838 °C, respectively. Compared to commonly used piezoelectric materials, Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7, Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7 materials with very high Curie temperatures were obtained with photoluminescent properties.

# INTRODUCTION
Materials with the general formula RE2B2O7 are known for their unique physical properties, such as catalytic activity, ferrimagnetism and ferromagnetism, piezoelectric behavior, giant magneto-resistance, high melting points. In this formula, "B" is a transition metal that can exist in various oxidation states and "RE" refers to a trivalent rare earth ion. Due to these properties, RE2B2O7 compounds are used in a wide range of applications, including, photoluminescent materials, solid oxide fuel cells, dielectric and piezoelectric smart materials, and immobilizers of nuclear waste sources (; ; , , , ). Researchers have shown significant interest in rare-earth germanates, specifically RE2B2O7, where "RE" represents rare earth ions. Despite the growing attention, many properties of RE2B2O7 compounds are still not fully understood. The luminescence of the EuE^{3+} ion has been extensively studied due to its ability to emit light in the visible spectrum. According to the Judd-Ofelt theory, the magnetic dipole transition of EuE^{3+} ions is E^{5}D0\u2192E^{7}F1 transition and does not depend on the asymmetry of the surrounding crystal enviroment. On the other hand, E^{5}D0\u2192E^{7}Fj (j = 2,4,6) transition is the electric dipole transitions which require an asymmetric environment around the EuE^{3+} ion in the unit cell to produce luminescence (; ; ; ; ). Additionally, inorganic functional materials doped with different rare earth ions have attracted significant attention in materials studies due to their unique optical, magnetic and electronic properties, which stem from their 4f electron configurations. For example, the Curie temperature of the widely used BaTiO3 (BT) is 100 \xb0C. While Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) offers a higher Curie temperature of 350 \xb0C, its use is limited due to the toxic effects of lead. To mitigate these issues, BiNaTiO3 (BNT) and KNaNbO3 (KNN) have been developed, with Curie temperatures of 200 \xb0C and 400 \xb0C, respectively. In this context, high Curie temperature Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7, Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7 smart materials were synthesized by the solid state method and characterized.

# CONCLUSION
Our goal was to synthesize and to characterize of the Eu2Ge2O7 activated with DyE^{3+}, LaE^{3+} and HoE^{3+} ions to explore their multifunctional properties. In this context, Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7, Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7 were firstly sythesized with solid state method and characterized them in terms of crystal structure, elemental analysis, surface morphology, photoluminescence, dielectric and piezoelectric properties. The lead-free Eu1.90Dy0.10Ge2O7, Eu1.90La0.10Ge2O7 and Eu1.90Ho0.10Ge2O7 has higher Curie temperature than commercial Pb(ZrxTi1-x)O3 (PZT), Na1- xBixTiO3 (NBT) and BaZr1-xTixO3 (BZT) (; ; ).
