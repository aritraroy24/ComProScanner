# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In order to study the effect of CuO doping on the morphology, structure and electrical properties of the single crystals, (1-x)[0.997(0.996 K0.5Na0.5NbO3-0.004BiAlO3)-0.003MnO2]-xCuO (x = 0 \u223c 0.009) samples were prepared by the SFSSCG method, as shown in. When x = 0.003 the crystal size reaches the maximum value of, about 15 \xd7 12 \xd7 2 mmE^{3}, as shown in. The reason may lie in that the addition of CuE^{2+} ions promotes the formation of liquid phase and reduces the crystal growth barrier in the system. It is worth noting that the color of the crystals also changes before and after doping, due to the introduction of CuE^{2+} ions, implying that CuE^{2+} ions enter the crystalline lattices of the single crystals and cause changes in its natures. (a) shows the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of (1-x)[0.997(0.996K0.5Na0.5NbO3-0.004BiAlO3)-0.003MnO2]-xCuO (x = 0 \u223c 0.009) crystals From the intensity-2\u03b8 relationship diagram, it can be seen that at room temperature, all single crystals have a typical perovskite structure, and the phases present in these crystals include two ones: orthorhombic and tetragonal. No diffraction pattern of impurity phase was found in the XRD spectrums, indicating that BiE^{3+}, AlE^{3+}, MnE^{4+} and CuE^{2+} ions have entered the lattices of the KNN crystals and formed a stable solid solution without other impurities. (b) shows a local magnification of the XRD patterns in the 2\u03b8 range of 44\u201348\xb0. It can be seen in the (b) that at about 45\xb0 there are two splitting diffraction peaks, which shift slightly to higher angles with the increase of CuO content. According to the Bragg equation: n\u03bb = 2dsin\u03b8, the shift of the diffraction peak to lower or higher angles reflects the lattice expansion or contraction caused by lattice distortion, which has been reported in previous studies. These phenomena should be explained by the introduction of CuE^{2+} ions in the KNN-based crystals. On the one hand, the radius of CuE^{2+} (0.72 \xc5) ions is lower than that of KE^{+} (1.64 \xc5) and NaE^{+} (1.39 \xc5) ions, but very close to that of NbE^{5+} (0.64 \xc5) ions. Korbel et al. theoretically studied the Cu-doped KNN systems, and proved that CuE^{2+} preferentially replaced NbE^{5+} sites in an oxygen atmosphere. A small amount of CuE^{2+} ions first enter the lattices and replace NbE^{5+} sites that are the B sites of the ABO3 lattices, causing lattice expansion and local valence imbalance. On the other hand, from the perspective of ion coordination number, the coordination number of MnE^{3+} ions is VI with radius of 0.645\xc5 and 0.58 \xc5, at high and low spin states, respectively. And the radius of MnE^{4+} (0.53 \xc5) ions is also close to that of NbE^{5+} (0.64 \xc5) ions. MnE^{4+}/MnE^{3+} ions prefer to occupy the B sites rather than the A sites (NaE^{+} (1.39 \xc5), KE^{+} (1.64 \xc5)). Furthermore, the oxygen vacancies caused by the substitution of MnE^{4+}/MnE^{3+} and CuE^{2+} ions for NbE^{5+} ion acceptors are conducive to mass migration and grain growth. In this work, it is believed that CuE^{2+} ions and MnE^{4+}/MnE^{3+} ions occupy the B sites of the lattices of the KNN crystals. To determine the phases present and their relative amounts in the single crystal samples, the above XRD data was refined by Rietveld theory (using PullProf software). The results of the refinement are shown in , further confirming that all single crystal samples exhibit a perovskite crystal structure with two phases coexisting of the orthorhombic phase with Amm2 (JCPDS 71-0946) and tetragonal phase with P4mm (JCPDS 71-0945). When x = 0.003, the percentage of the orthorhombic phase is about 42 %, while the percentage of tetragonal phase is 58 %, which is consistent with the XRD patterns mentioned above. Researches have indicated that when the intensity ratio of the (022)/(200) peaks is close to 1:1, the relative amounts of the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases are close to 1:1. The above results indicate that the addition of elements such as Cu and Mn can regulate the phase amounts without changing the ferroelectric perovskite structure of the KNN crystals, thus potentially controlling their piezoelectric properties. shows the SEM photos of the natural surface morphology of (1-x)[0.997(0.996K0.5Na0.5NbO3-0.004BiAlO3)-0.003MnO2]-xCuO (x = 0 \u223c 0.009) crystals, indicating that the crystals grow in a two-dimensional layered manner. Compared with other samples, the surface of the crystals at x = 0.003 and 0.005 is flatter and smoother, indicating that the samples have better crystallinity. In order to observe their internal structure, the KNN-based single crystals were polished and etched with hydrofluoric acid. The positive end of the dipole moment is etched very quickly by the acid, while the negative end is etched very slowly. shows the SEM images of the ferroelectric domains and their distribution inside the (1-x)(KNN-BA-Mn)-xCuO crystals. The results show that the crystals are mainly composed of 180\xb0 domains which are similar to the parallel layered structure. When the CuO doping content is at x = 0.003, the average ferroelectric domain width of the single crystal is the smallest, about 284 nm, while its piezoelectric constant is the largest, which is 583 pC/N. This indicates that Cu doping can not only regulate the phase content of KNN-based crystals, but also their domain structure, thereby controlling their piezoelectric properties. In addition to the domain structure characteristics mentioned above, the internal structure of the crystal is extremely compact and no pores are observed, implying that the crystals have high quality which is also beneficial for improving the performance of the crystals. (a) and (b) show the dependence of dielectric constant (\u03b5) and loss (tan \u03b4) measured at 50 kHz on temperature (T) of (1-x)(KNN-BA-Mn)-xCuO single crystals. In addition, (b) also shows the relationship between the dielectric loss and temperature below 200 \xb0C for the single crystal samples. From (b), it can be seen that all the crystals have relatively low dielectric loss below 200 \xb0C, less than 2 %. When x = 0.003, the dielectric loss of the crystal is the lowest, at 0. 67 %. This indicates that proper doping of CuO can reduce dielectric loss of KNN-based crystals and improve their crystal quality. And in CuE^{2+} doped KNN, defect dipoles are formed between oxygen vacancies and CuE^{2+} cations. Moreover, (c) shows the relationship curves of T O-T and T C as a function of x for (1-x)(KNN-BA-Mn)-xCuO single crystals. When x = 0.003, the T C of the crystal reaches a maximum value of 418\xb0C, while the T O-T is relatively low, which is beneficial for expanding its working temperature range. (a) shows the dependence of piezoelectric coefficient (d 33 ) and dielectric loss (tan \u03b4) on CuO content of the crystals at room temperature. It can be seen from the figure that the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 of the crystals has a strong dependence on the CuO content. With the increase of CuO content, the d 33 value first increases and then decreases. When x = 0.003, the d 33 value reaches the maximum of 583 pC/N. When the doping amount is at x = 0.003, the minimum dielectric loss of 0.67 % is obtained for the crystal. This may attribute to the substitution of CuE^{2+} ions for NbE^{5+} ions in the KNN lattices. With the increase of x, the substitution degree of CuE^{2+} for NbE^{5+} ions gradually has been intensified, and then the charges distribution in the crystals has gradually stabilized, which has made the dielectric loss of the crystals decrease. When the x value continues to increase up to 0.003, the substitution degree of CuE^{2+} to NbE^{5+} ions reaches an equilibrium state, and the charges distribution in the crystal has also approached stabilization, which minimizes the dielectric loss of the crystal. However, as the CuO doping amount further increases, the oxygen vacancies on the crystals also increase, resulting in a "pinning effect" on the domain wall, causing the d 33 of the crystals to decrease. In addition, the stability of the crystal phase structure and lattice vibration will also affect the change of tan \u03b4 value of dielectrics. The mechanical quality factor, Q m , and thickness electromechanical coupling coefficient k t of (1-x)(KNN-BA-Mn)-xCuO are shown in (b). It is obvious that the dependence of Q m and k t on CuO content is similar to that of the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 , revealing the hard-doping characteristics of CuE^{2+} ions in KNN system. When x = 0.003, the Q m and k t of the crystal reach the maximum values of 96 and 0.39, respectively. Overall, when the Cu content is at x 0.003, the crystal obtains the best electrical properties including the piezoelectric, dielectric and electromechanical coupling since the crystal has high compactness and quality, smooth and straight parallel domains, stoichiometry with a minimal mismatch, and two-phases coexistence with appropriate percentage at this time. What\u2019s more, the width of the parallel domains is the smallest for the crystal at x = 0.003, meaning that the domain rotation is more easily triggered by an external electric field, which enhances the piezoelectric activities of the KNN-based crystals. (a) shows the hysteresis loops of (1-x)(KNN-BA-Mn)-xCuO single crystals under an electric field of 30 kV/cm. It can be seen from the figure that all crystals exhibit typical ferroelectric properties, and have good saturated P-E loops, with low coercive fields of E C <10 kV/cm. What\u2019s more, the presence of a two-phase coexistence region also makes domain wall movement become easier. b shows the curves of P r and E C of (1-x)(KNN-BA-Mn)-xCuO single crystals as a function of CuO content (x). It is observed that the P r of the samples first increases and then decreases with the increase of x, reaching a maximum value of 38.9 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at x = 0.003. This is due to the changes in the average domain width, phase amounts and lattice distortion caused by the addition of Cu\xb2\u207a ions, which promotes the activation of ferroelectric domains in the crystal, thereby enhancing its polarization. Excessive CuO addition introduces a large number of defects, exerting a strong pinning effect on domain rotation, which overrides the promotion of domain rotation by domain refinement. (c) is the hysteresis loops of the sample with x = 0.003 tested at different frequencies. It can be seen from the figure that the residual polarization intensity (P r ) reaches up to 50 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at low frequencies. At frequencies greater than 10 Hz, the P r of the samples is almost stably at 20 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}. This can be reflected by the P-E loops since the shape of the P-E curves can be obvious affected by leakage current, and leakage current usually enlarges the observed values of the Pr and Ec. (d) is the hysteresis loops of the CuO-doped samples at 40 Hz. All single crystals show a relatively stable remnant polarization intensity P r (about 20 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}) and a relatively small E C (10\u201312 kV/cm), indicating that the single crystals have good intrinsic ferroelectric properties. summarizes some of main electrical properties of the crystals investigated in this work. For comparative purposes, it also includes relative parameters of KNN-based ceramics and crystals reported in the literatures. These results suggest that the Cu-containing multiple elements codoped KNN crystals grown by the SFSSCG method have promising potential for future applications.

# ABSTRACT
(1-x)[0.997(0.996K0.5Na0.5NbO3-0.004BiAlO3)-0.003MnO2]-xCuO(x = 0â0.009) lead-free piezoelectric single crystals were prepared by a seed-free solid-state growth (SFSSCG) method, and multiple-elements codoping modification on KNN crystals was conducted, and especially the effects of Cu-doping on the structure and electrical properties of the crystals were systematically studied. XRD and corresponding refinement results show that a perovskite structure with a coexistence of orthorhombic and tetragonal phases has formed in the crystals. When the CuO content is at x= 0.003, the contents of the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases are almost equal. At this moment, the crystal also achieves its maximum size, about 16 Ã 14 Ã 2â¯mm3. The domains in the crystals are mainly composed of 180Â° parallel domains, the domain width first decreases and then increases with the increase of CuO content.

# INTRODUCTION
As a promising functional material, potassium sodium niobate (K0.5Na0.5NbO3, KNN)-based lead-free piezoelectric ceramics show great potential in many practical application fields. KNN-based lead-free piezoelectric materials have become a shining star in the field of lead-free piezoelectric materials due to their unique crystalline structure and excellent piezoelectric properties. In the study of KNN-based lead-free piezoelectric materials, researchers have continuously improved their performance by optimizing the preparation process, doping modification, and introducing new components, etc. In 2004, Y. Saito et al. successfully synthesized KNN-based lead-free piezoelectric textured ceramics with a piezoelectric constant d 33 of 416 pC/N by co-doping Li, Sb, and Ta elements and combining a reaction template grain growth technology. Its piezoelectric performance was significantly improved compared with the traditional KNN-based lead-free piezoelectric ceramics. For example, Eagle Park et al. reported that the piezoelectric constant (d 33 ) of the PZN-PT and PMN-PT piezoelectric single crystals in the (001) orientation can be as high as 2500 pC/N. The d 33 of Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3-BaTiO3 single crystals is about 483 pC/N , which is 2\u20133 times higher than that of Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3-BaTiO3-based ceramics. For the KNN system, the piezoelectric properties of single crystals has been also expected to be higher than that of ceramics. In recent years, according to relevant literature reports, the main methods for preparing KNN-based single crystals are top seed method, Bridgman method, molten salt method, and solid-state crystal growth method, ect. In 2014, Luo et al.. successfully prepared (K0.25Na0.75)NbO3 single crystals with d 33 =145pC/N and thickness electromechanical coupling coefficient k t =69 % using the Top-Seeded Solution Growth (TSSG). In 2007, Chen's team successfully prepared 0.95 (K0.5Na0.5)NbO3\u20130.05LiNbO3 single crystal samples with perovskite structure by the Bridgman method. The single crystal showed good piezoelectric properties (d 33 = 405 pC/N, \u03b5 = 267, k t = 0.61, T O-T = 192 \xb0C, T C = 426 \xb0C, tan \u03b4 = 1.1 %). Geeta Ray et al. grew a high-quality NKLN lead-free piezoelectric single crystal with a size of 10 \xd7 11 \xd7 6 mmE^{3} using the flux method, and found that the crystal has a high Curie temperature (T C \u223c 420 \xb0C) and a piezoelectric coefficient (d 33 = 115 pC/N). In 2008, John G. Fisher et al. used KTaO3 seed crystals as template and K4CuNb8O23 as flux for the first time to grow dense KNN-based single crystals by the solid state crystal growth method (SSCG). People has been actively looking for new methods to prepare KNN single crystals. Recently, Jiang et al. reported a seed-free solid-state crystal growth (SFSSCG) method. At temperature below the melting temperature of the system, centimeter-scale bulk KNN single crystals with a low segregation coefficient can be grown by a simple route similar to the ceramic process. In 2009, Jiang et al. successfully prepared millimeter-scale KNN single crystals by using the SFSSCG method. In 2015, Jiang et al. further prepared centimeter-scale KNN-based crystal with the maximum size of 11\xd79\xd73 mmE^{3}. The crystal obtained good electrical properties as follows: P r =20.6 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, d 33 = 272 pC/N. In 2017, Song et al. successfully prepared KNN-CaZrO3 single crystals with 2-centimeter level and d 33 of up to 488 pC/N by the SFSSCG method. Compared with the above traditional methods, the SFSSCG method has extraordinary advantages such as low energy consumption, low investment, high composition uniformity, etc., and can overcome the problems of incompatible melting and high volatility. However, the dielectric loss of KNN-based crystals prepared by the SFSSCG method is relatively high, which has limited the performance of the crystal to a certain extent. In order to improve the piezoelectric and dielectric properties of KNN crystals, doping modification can be used for the preparation of high-performance KNN crystals. Many studies have shown that BiAlO3 is a new type of lead-free piezoelectric material with a perovskite structure. It does not undergo phase transition within a relatively wide temperature range of \u2212133\u2013550 \xb0C, making it suitable for high-temperature piezoelectric devices. Moreover, it has also been found that BiAlO3 has excellent ferroelectric properties. Theoretical calculations also show that BiAlO3 has a rhombohedral perovskite structure, manifesting a very large spontaneous polarization of about 76\u03bcC/cmE^{2} and high Curie temperature of about 527\xb0C. What\u2019s more, it has also been supported that introducing acceptor dopants to improve the electrical properties and Q m value of the KNN system is an effective method. Some metal oxides, such as CuO , MnO2 and ZnO , have been added into ceramics usually as acceptor dopants and sintering aids. Studies have shown that CuO is an effective acceptor dopant that can induce hardening characteristics in KNN ceramics, thereby improving mechanical quality factor (Q m ) value of KNN ceramics and reducing dielectric loss; at the same time, CuO is also an excellent sintering aid that can reduce the sintering temperature and improve its electrical properties. For example, in 2015, Shen et al. successfully prepared KNN-based ceramics with high mechanical quality factor Q m of 323 and low dielectric loss of 0.8 % and relatively high piezoelectric constant d 33 of >180 pC/N by doping CuO. R Mahdi et al. prepared lead-free (Na0.5K0.5)NbO3-(Bi0.5Li0.5)TiO3-Fe2O3 ceramics and constructed an orthorhombic-tetragonal polymorphic phase transition (PPT) region to improve its electrical properties (d 33 \u223c 246 pC/N, k p \u223c 49 %, \u03b5 r \u223c 1420, tan \u03b4 \u223c 0.35, P r \u223c 23\xb5C/cmE^{2}, and T C \u223c 343 \xb0C) Copper derivatives such as K4CuNb8O23 (KCN) and K5.4Cu1.3Ta10O29 (KCT)have also been often considered to be the most effective sintering aids , because CuE^{2+} ions enter the KNN lattices to produce oxygen vacancies, which can not only reduce the sintering temperature but also improve the Q m of the ceramics, while also helping to reduce the dielectric loss. In addition, Dabin Lin et al. also studied the effect of MnO2 doping on the electrical properties of KNN-based single crystals. The results showed that MnO2-doped KNN crystals exhibited higher piezoelectric coefficients (d 33 = 270 pC/N) and dielectric constants (\u03b5 r = 730) compared with pure KNN crystals. In this work, a series of KNN-based crystals were grown by the SFSSCG method, and on the basis of previous studies on KNN crystals doped with Bi, Al and Mn elements, Cu element was further added into KNN crystals for further improving their piezoelectric, ferroelectric and dielectric properties, especially for decreasing their dielectric loss. This present paper will therefore focus on the growth of large-size and high-performance single crystals of KNN-based crystal by using the SFSSCG method, paying special attention to its performance impact and the crystal growth. Additionally, as a commonly used additive in the fabrication of polar oxide functional ceramics, CuO, MnO2, BiAlO3 are also introduced together into the KNN compositions in an attempt to improve the growth and electrical performances of KNN-based crystals.

# CONCLUSION
(1-x)[0.997(0.996K0.5Na0.5NbO3-0.004BiAlO3)-0.003MnO2]-xCuO (x = 0 \u223c 0.009) lead-free piezoelectric single crystals were successfully prepared by a seed-free solid-state crystal growth method, and the effects of CuO doping amounts on the micromorphology, phase structure and amounts, domain structure and electrical properties of the single crystals were systematically studied. It is found in this study that the co-addition of Cu together with Mn, Bi and Al elements in KNN crystals can effectively modify the growth and microstructure of the crystals. When x = 0.003, the size of the crystal reaches the maximum value of about 15 \xd7 12 \xd7 2 mmE^{3}, at this moment, the percentage of the orthorhombic phase in the crystal is about 42 %, while the percentage of tetragonal phase is 58 %. Cu doping can not only regulate the phase content and domain structure, but also suppress or balance the electrical defects in KNN-based crystals, thereby controlling their piezoelectric properties. When the CuO doping content is at x = 0.003, the dielectric loss of KNN-based crystal is as low as 0.67 %, and meanwhile the crystal also has excellent comprehensive properties as below: d 33 = 583 pC/N, T c = 418 \xb0C, P r = 38.9 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, E c = 7.5 KV/cm, Q m = 96, and k t = 0.39. In summary, the Cu-containing multiple elements codoped KNN crystals grown by the SFSSCG method have promising potential for future applications, since they have enhanced piezoelectric coefficient and remanent polarization as well as reduced dielectric loss and coercive field, while maintaining a high Curie temperature.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In order to study the effect of CuO doping on the morphology, structure and electrical properties of the single crystals, (1-x)[0.997(0.996 K0.5Na0.5NbO3-0.004BiAlO3)-0.003MnO2]-xCuO (x = 0 \u223c 0.009) samples were prepared by the SFSSCG method, as shown in. When x = 0.003 the crystal size reaches the maximum value of, about 15 \xd7 12 \xd7 2 mmE^{3}, as shown in. The reason may lie in that the addition of CuE^{2+} ions promotes the formation of liquid phase and reduces the crystal growth barrier in the system. It is worth noting that the color of the crystals also changes before and after doping, due to the introduction of CuE^{2+} ions, implying that CuE^{2+} ions enter the crystalline lattices of the single crystals and cause changes in its natures. (a) shows the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of (1-x)[0.997(0.996K0.5Na0.5NbO3-0.004BiAlO3)-0.003MnO2]-xCuO (x = 0 \u223c 0.009) crystals From the intensity-2\u03b8 relationship diagram, it can be seen that at room temperature, all single crystals have a typical perovskite structure, and the phases present in these crystals include two ones: orthorhombic and tetragonal. No diffraction pattern of impurity phase was found in the XRD spectrums, indicating that BiE^{3+}, AlE^{3+}, MnE^{4+} and CuE^{2+} ions have entered the lattices of the KNN crystals and formed a stable solid solution without other impurities. (b) shows a local magnification of the XRD patterns in the 2\u03b8 range of 44\u201348\xb0. It can be seen in the (b) that at about 45\xb0 there are two splitting diffraction peaks, which shift slightly to higher angles with the increase of CuO content. According to the Bragg equation: n\u03bb = 2dsin\u03b8, the shift of the diffraction peak to lower or higher angles reflects the lattice expansion or contraction caused by lattice distortion, which has been reported in previous studies. These phenomena should be explained by the introduction of CuE^{2+} ions in the KNN-based crystals. On the one hand, the radius of CuE^{2+} (0.72 \xc5) ions is lower than that of KE^{+} (1.64 \xc5) and NaE^{+} (1.39 \xc5) ions, but very close to that of NbE^{5+} (0.64 \xc5) ions. Korbel et al. theoretically studied the Cu-doped KNN systems, and proved that CuE^{2+} preferentially replaced NbE^{5+} sites in an oxygen atmosphere. A small amount of CuE^{2+} ions first enter the lattices and replace NbE^{5+} sites that are the B sites of the ABO3 lattices, causing lattice expansion and local valence imbalance. On the other hand, from the perspective of ion coordination number, the coordination number of MnE^{3+} ions is VI with radius of 0.645\xc5 and 0.58 \xc5, at high and low spin states, respectively. And the radius of MnE^{4+} (0.53 \xc5) ions is also close to that of NbE^{5+} (0.64 \xc5) ions. MnE^{4+}/MnE^{3+} ions prefer to occupy the B sites rather than the A sites (NaE^{+} (1.39 \xc5), KE^{+} (1.64 \xc5)). Furthermore, the oxygen vacancies caused by the substitution of MnE^{4+}/MnE^{3+} and CuE^{2+} ions for NbE^{5+} ion acceptors are conducive to mass migration and grain growth. In this work, it is believed that CuE^{2+} ions and MnE^{4+}/MnE^{3+} ions occupy the B sites of the lattices of the KNN crystals. To determine the phases present and their relative amounts in the single crystal samples, the above XRD data was refined by Rietveld theory (using PullProf software). The results of the refinement are shown in , further confirming that all single crystal samples exhibit a perovskite crystal structure with two phases coexisting of the orthorhombic phase with Amm2 (JCPDS 71-0946) and tetragonal phase with P4mm (JCPDS 71-0945). When x = 0.003, the percentage of the orthorhombic phase is about 42 %, while the percentage of tetragonal phase is 58 %, which is consistent with the XRD patterns mentioned above. Researches have indicated that when the intensity ratio of the (022)/(200) peaks is close to 1:1, the relative amounts of the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases are close to 1:1. The above results indicate that the addition of elements such as Cu and Mn can regulate the phase amounts without changing the ferroelectric perovskite structure of the KNN crystals, thus potentially controlling their piezoelectric properties. shows the SEM photos of the natural surface morphology of (1-x)[0.997(0.996K0.5Na0.5NbO3-0.004BiAlO3)-0.003MnO2]-xCuO (x = 0 \u223c 0.009) crystals, indicating that the crystals grow in a two-dimensional layered manner. Compared with other samples, the surface of the crystals at x = 0.003 and 0.005 is flatter and smoother, indicating that the samples have better crystallinity. In order to observe their internal structure, the KNN-based single crystals were polished and etched with hydrofluoric acid. The positive end of the dipole moment is etched very quickly by the acid, while the negative end is etched very slowly. shows the SEM images of the ferroelectric domains and their distribution inside the (1-x)(KNN-BA-Mn)-xCuO crystals. The results show that the crystals are mainly composed of 180\xb0 domains which are similar to the parallel layered structure. When the CuO doping content is at x = 0.003, the average ferroelectric domain width of the single crystal is the smallest, about 284 nm, while its piezoelectric constant is the largest, which is 583 pC/N. This indicates that Cu doping can not only regulate the phase content of KNN-based crystals, but also their domain structure, thereby controlling their piezoelectric properties. In addition to the domain structure characteristics mentioned above, the internal structure of the crystal is extremely compact and no pores are observed, implying that the crystals have high quality which is also beneficial for improving the performance of the crystals. (a) and (b) show the dependence of dielectric constant (\u03b5) and loss (tan \u03b4) measured at 50 kHz on temperature (T) of (1-x)(KNN-BA-Mn)-xCuO single crystals. In addition, (b) also shows the relationship between the dielectric loss and temperature below 200 \xb0C for the single crystal samples. From (b), it can be seen that all the crystals have relatively low dielectric loss below 200 \xb0C, less than 2 %. When x = 0.003, the dielectric loss of the crystal is the lowest, at 0. 67 %. This indicates that proper doping of CuO can reduce dielectric loss of KNN-based crystals and improve their crystal quality. And in CuE^{2+} doped KNN, defect dipoles are formed between oxygen vacancies and CuE^{2+} cations. Moreover, (c) shows the relationship curves of T O-T and T C as a function of x for (1-x)(KNN-BA-Mn)-xCuO single crystals. When x = 0.003, the T C of the crystal reaches a maximum value of 418\xb0C, while the T O-T is relatively low, which is beneficial for expanding its working temperature range. (a) shows the dependence of piezoelectric coefficient (d 33 ) and dielectric loss (tan \u03b4) on CuO content of the crystals at room temperature. It can be seen from the figure that the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 of the crystals has a strong dependence on the CuO content. With the increase of CuO content, the d 33 value first increases and then decreases. When x = 0.003, the d 33 value reaches the maximum of 583 pC/N. When the doping amount is at x = 0.003, the minimum dielectric loss of 0.67 % is obtained for the crystal. This may attribute to the substitution of CuE^{2+} ions for NbE^{5+} ions in the KNN lattices. With the increase of x, the substitution degree of CuE^{2+} for NbE^{5+} ions gradually has been intensified, and then the charges distribution in the crystals has gradually stabilized, which has made the dielectric loss of the crystals decrease. When the x value continues to increase up to 0.003, the substitution degree of CuE^{2+} to NbE^{5+} ions reaches an equilibrium state, and the charges distribution in the crystal has also approached stabilization, which minimizes the dielectric loss of the crystal. However, as the CuO doping amount further increases, the oxygen vacancies on the crystals also increase, resulting in a "pinning effect" on the domain wall, causing the d 33 of the crystals to decrease. In addition, the stability of the crystal phase structure and lattice vibration will also affect the change of tan \u03b4 value of dielectrics. The mechanical quality factor, Q m , and thickness electromechanical coupling coefficient k t of (1-x)(KNN-BA-Mn)-xCuO are shown in (b). It is obvious that the dependence of Q m and k t on CuO content is similar to that of the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 , revealing the hard-doping characteristics of CuE^{2+} ions in KNN system. When x = 0.003, the Q m and k t of the crystal reach the maximum values of 96 and 0.39, respectively. Overall, when the Cu content is at x 0.003, the crystal obtains the best electrical properties including the piezoelectric, dielectric and electromechanical coupling since the crystal has high compactness and quality, smooth and straight parallel domains, stoichiometry with a minimal mismatch, and two-phases coexistence with appropriate percentage at this time. What\u2019s more, the width of the parallel domains is the smallest for the crystal at x = 0.003, meaning that the domain rotation is more easily triggered by an external electric field, which enhances the piezoelectric activities of the KNN-based crystals. (a) shows the hysteresis loops of (1-x)(KNN-BA-Mn)-xCuO single crystals under an electric field of 30 kV/cm. It can be seen from the figure that all crystals exhibit typical ferroelectric properties, and have good saturated P-E loops, with low coercive fields of E C <10 kV/cm. What\u2019s more, the presence of a two-phase coexistence region also makes domain wall movement become easier. b shows the curves of P r and E C of (1-x)(KNN-BA-Mn)-xCuO single crystals as a function of CuO content (x). It is observed that the P r of the samples first increases and then decreases with the increase of x, reaching a maximum value of 38.9 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at x = 0.003. This is due to the changes in the average domain width, phase amounts and lattice distortion caused by the addition of Cu\xb2\u207a ions, which promotes the activation of ferroelectric domains in the crystal, thereby enhancing its polarization. Excessive CuO addition introduces a large number of defects, exerting a strong pinning effect on domain rotation, which overrides the promotion of domain rotation by domain refinement. (c) is the hysteresis loops of the sample with x = 0.003 tested at different frequencies. It can be seen from the figure that the residual polarization intensity (P r ) reaches up to 50 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at low frequencies. At frequencies greater than 10 Hz, the P r of the samples is almost stably at 20 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}. This can be reflected by the P-E loops since the shape of the P-E curves can be obvious affected by leakage current, and leakage current usually enlarges the observed values of the Pr and Ec. (d) is the hysteresis loops of the CuO-doped samples at 40 Hz. All single crystals show a relatively stable remnant polarization intensity P r (about 20 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}) and a relatively small E C (10\u201312 kV/cm), indicating that the single crystals have good intrinsic ferroelectric properties. summarizes some of main electrical properties of the crystals investigated in this work. For comparative purposes, it also includes relative parameters of KNN-based ceramics and crystals reported in the literatures. These results suggest that the Cu-containing multiple elements codoped KNN crystals grown by the SFSSCG method have promising potential for future applications.

# ABSTRACT
(1-x)[0.997(0.996K0.5Na0.5NbO3-0.004BiAlO3)-0.003MnO2]-xCuO(x = 0â0.009) lead-free piezoelectric single crystals were prepared by a seed-free solid-state growth (SFSSCG) method, and multiple-elements codoping modification on KNN crystals was conducted, and especially the effects of Cu-doping on the structure and electrical properties of the crystals were systematically studied. XRD and corresponding refinement results show that a perovskite structure with a coexistence of orthorhombic and tetragonal phases has formed in the crystals. When the CuO content is at x= 0.003, the contents of the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases are almost equal. At this moment, the crystal also achieves its maximum size, about 16 Ã 14 Ã 2â¯mm3. The domains in the crystals are mainly composed of 180Â° parallel domains, the domain width first decreases and then increases with the increase of CuO content.

# INTRODUCTION
As a promising functional material, potassium sodium niobate (K0.5Na0.5NbO3, KNN)-based lead-free piezoelectric ceramics show great potential in many practical application fields. KNN-based lead-free piezoelectric materials have become a shining star in the field of lead-free piezoelectric materials due to their unique crystalline structure and excellent piezoelectric properties. In the study of KNN-based lead-free piezoelectric materials, researchers have continuously improved their performance by optimizing the preparation process, doping modification, and introducing new components, etc. In 2004, Y. Saito et al. successfully synthesized KNN-based lead-free piezoelectric textured ceramics with a piezoelectric constant d 33 of 416 pC/N by co-doping Li, Sb, and Ta elements and combining a reaction template grain growth technology. Its piezoelectric performance was significantly improved compared with the traditional KNN-based lead-free piezoelectric ceramics. For example, Eagle Park et al. reported that the piezoelectric constant (d 33 ) of the PZN-PT and PMN-PT piezoelectric single crystals in the (001) orientation can be as high as 2500 pC/N. The d 33 of Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3-BaTiO3 single crystals is about 483 pC/N , which is 2\u20133 times higher than that of Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3-BaTiO3-based ceramics. For the KNN system, the piezoelectric properties of single crystals has been also expected to be higher than that of ceramics. In recent years, according to relevant literature reports, the main methods for preparing KNN-based single crystals are top seed method, Bridgman method, molten salt method, and solid-state crystal growth method, ect. In 2014, Luo et al.. successfully prepared (K0.25Na0.75)NbO3 single crystals with d 33 =145pC/N and thickness electromechanical coupling coefficient k t =69 % using the Top-Seeded Solution Growth (TSSG). In 2007, Chen's team successfully prepared 0.95 (K0.5Na0.5)NbO3\u20130.05LiNbO3 single crystal samples with perovskite structure by the Bridgman method. The single crystal showed good piezoelectric properties (d 33 = 405 pC/N, \u03b5 = 267, k t = 0.61, T O-T = 192 \xb0C, T C = 426 \xb0C, tan \u03b4 = 1.1 %). Geeta Ray et al. grew a high-quality NKLN lead-free piezoelectric single crystal with a size of 10 \xd7 11 \xd7 6 mmE^{3} using the flux method, and found that the crystal has a high Curie temperature (T C \u223c 420 \xb0C) and a piezoelectric coefficient (d 33 = 115 pC/N). In 2008, John G. Fisher et al. used KTaO3 seed crystals as template and K4CuNb8O23 as flux for the first time to grow dense KNN-based single crystals by the solid state crystal growth method (SSCG). People has been actively looking for new methods to prepare KNN single crystals. Recently, Jiang et al. reported a seed-free solid-state crystal growth (SFSSCG) method. At temperature below the melting temperature of the system, centimeter-scale bulk KNN single crystals with a low segregation coefficient can be grown by a simple route similar to the ceramic process. In 2009, Jiang et al. successfully prepared millimeter-scale KNN single crystals by using the SFSSCG method. In 2015, Jiang et al. further prepared centimeter-scale KNN-based crystal with the maximum size of 11\xd79\xd73 mmE^{3}. The crystal obtained good electrical properties as follows: P r =20.6 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, d 33 = 272 pC/N. In 2017, Song et al. successfully prepared KNN-CaZrO3 single crystals with 2-centimeter level and d 33 of up to 488 pC/N by the SFSSCG method. Compared with the above traditional methods, the SFSSCG method has extraordinary advantages such as low energy consumption, low investment, high composition uniformity, etc., and can overcome the problems of incompatible melting and high volatility. However, the dielectric loss of KNN-based crystals prepared by the SFSSCG method is relatively high, which has limited the performance of the crystal to a certain extent. In order to improve the piezoelectric and dielectric properties of KNN crystals, doping modification can be used for the preparation of high-performance KNN crystals. Many studies have shown that BiAlO3 is a new type of lead-free piezoelectric material with a perovskite structure. It does not undergo phase transition within a relatively wide temperature range of \u2212133\u2013550 \xb0C, making it suitable for high-temperature piezoelectric devices. Moreover, it has also been found that BiAlO3 has excellent ferroelectric properties. Theoretical calculations also show that BiAlO3 has a rhombohedral perovskite structure, manifesting a very large spontaneous polarization of about 76\u03bcC/cmE^{2} and high Curie temperature of about 527\xb0C. What\u2019s more, it has also been supported that introducing acceptor dopants to improve the electrical properties and Q m value of the KNN system is an effective method. Some metal oxides, such as CuO , MnO2 and ZnO , have been added into ceramics usually as acceptor dopants and sintering aids. Studies have shown that CuO is an effective acceptor dopant that can induce hardening characteristics in KNN ceramics, thereby improving mechanical quality factor (Q m ) value of KNN ceramics and reducing dielectric loss; at the same time, CuO is also an excellent sintering aid that can reduce the sintering temperature and improve its electrical properties. For example, in 2015, Shen et al. successfully prepared KNN-based ceramics with high mechanical quality factor Q m of 323 and low dielectric loss of 0.8 % and relatively high piezoelectric constant d 33 of >180 pC/N by doping CuO. R Mahdi et al. prepared lead-free (Na0.5K0.5)NbO3-(Bi0.5Li0.5)TiO3-Fe2O3 ceramics and constructed an orthorhombic-tetragonal polymorphic phase transition (PPT) region to improve its electrical properties (d 33 \u223c 246 pC/N, k p \u223c 49 %, \u03b5 r \u223c 1420, tan \u03b4 \u223c 0.35, P r \u223c 23\xb5C/cmE^{2}, and T C \u223c 343 \xb0C) Copper derivatives such as K4CuNb8O23 (KCN) and K5.4Cu1.3Ta10O29 (KCT)have also been often considered to be the most effective sintering aids , because CuE^{2+} ions enter the KNN lattices to produce oxygen vacancies, which can not only reduce the sintering temperature but also improve the Q m of the ceramics, while also helping to reduce the dielectric loss. In addition, Dabin Lin et al. also studied the effect of MnO2 doping on the electrical properties of KNN-based single crystals. The results showed that MnO2-doped KNN crystals exhibited higher piezoelectric coefficients (d 33 = 270 pC/N) and dielectric constants (\u03b5 r = 730) compared with pure KNN crystals. In this work, a series of KNN-based crystals were grown by the SFSSCG method, and on the basis of previous studies on KNN crystals doped with Bi, Al and Mn elements, Cu element was further added into KNN crystals for further improving their piezoelectric, ferroelectric and dielectric properties, especially for decreasing their dielectric loss. This present paper will therefore focus on the growth of large-size and high-performance single crystals of KNN-based crystal by using the SFSSCG method, paying special attention to its performance impact and the crystal growth. Additionally, as a commonly used additive in the fabrication of polar oxide functional ceramics, CuO, MnO2, BiAlO3 are also introduced together into the KNN compositions in an attempt to improve the growth and electrical performances of KNN-based crystals.

# CONCLUSION
(1-x)[0.997(0.996K0.5Na0.5NbO3-0.004BiAlO3)-0.003MnO2]-xCuO (x = 0 \u223c 0.009) lead-free piezoelectric single crystals were successfully prepared by a seed-free solid-state crystal growth method, and the effects of CuO doping amounts on the micromorphology, phase structure and amounts, domain structure and electrical properties of the single crystals were systematically studied. It is found in this study that the co-addition of Cu together with Mn, Bi and Al elements in KNN crystals can effectively modify the growth and microstructure of the crystals. When x = 0.003, the size of the crystal reaches the maximum value of about 15 \xd7 12 \xd7 2 mmE^{3}, at this moment, the percentage of the orthorhombic phase in the crystal is about 42 %, while the percentage of tetragonal phase is 58 %. Cu doping can not only regulate the phase content and domain structure, but also suppress or balance the electrical defects in KNN-based crystals, thereby controlling their piezoelectric properties. When the CuO doping content is at x = 0.003, the dielectric loss of KNN-based crystal is as low as 0.67 %, and meanwhile the crystal also has excellent comprehensive properties as below: d 33 = 583 pC/N, T c = 418 \xb0C, P r = 38.9 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, E c = 7.5 KV/cm, Q m = 96, and k t = 0.39. In summary, the Cu-containing multiple elements codoped KNN crystals grown by the SFSSCG method have promising potential for future applications, since they have enhanced piezoelectric coefficient and remanent polarization as well as reduced dielectric loss and coercive field, while maintaining a high Curie temperature.

**Notes**:
- Write complete chemical formulas (e.g. '(Use the abbreviation key-value pair to track the abbreviations while extracting composition-property keywords). Don't use abbreviations, but you can use different environment if multiple compositions have different d33 values in different environments. For e.g.: 'LiNbO3-Air' and 'LiNbO3-Vacuum'.
- If multiple compositions are mentioned with different d33 values, extract all compositions mentioning different type/environment with a '-' and coreresponding d33 values.
- Mos of the formula are provided in ABSTRACT or INTRODUCTION or first part of EXPERIMENTAL SYNTHESIS.
- Use element symbols (e.g. 'K' not 'Potassium')
- For compositions with variables:
   * If multiple d33 values exist: Extract all compositions by substituting each variable value
   * If single d33 value: Extract only the best composition
- Prioritize data from tables
- Preserve proper chemical notation including:
   * Subscripts for atom counts
   * Parentheses for grouped elements
   * Proper fraction formatting
- Include the measurement unit for d33 values (usually pC/N or pm/V)
- Identify the broader family/class of materials - can be abbreviated forms
- Include if there is any doping in the composition using '+' sign with the composition, e.g. 'LiNbO3 + 2%wt Mg'
- Don't remove brackets or parentheses from the chemical formula which is already in the composition. Also, sometimes fractions are written before the composition (mostly in ()) for composition mixtures, don't remove them.
- Don't modify the abbreviation from referenced papers unless full composition is not available.
- ALWAYS follow the asked JSON format. DON'T write any extra information such as note points or explanations.
