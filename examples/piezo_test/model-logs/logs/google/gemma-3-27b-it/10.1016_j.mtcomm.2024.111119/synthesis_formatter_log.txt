**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'SFSSCG', 'precursors': ['Sodium carbonate', 'Potassium carbonate', 'Aluminium trioxide', 'Bismuth oxide', 'Manganese dioxide', 'Copper oxide', 'Niobium oxide'], 'steps': ['Raw materials powders were heated to 120 °C for 6 h.', 'Raw materials were weighed according to stoichiometric ratio and mixed with anhydrous ethanol and zirconia ball medium.', 'The mixture was ball-milled at 410 r/min for 24 h and then dried.', 'The obtained mixture was sieved by a 100-mesh sifter.', 'Calcination at 750 °C for 6 h.', 'Secondary ball milling for 24 h.', 'Sieved through a 150-mesh sifter after drying.', 'Compacted to disks of 25 mm diameter and 2–3 mm thickness.', 'Sintered in air at 1108 °C for 21 h in a muffle furnace.', 'Crystals were cut and ground into disc-like specimens with a thickness of 0.5–0.6 mm.', 'Poled under a DC field of 30 kV/cm at 100 °C for 30 min in a silicone oil bath.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'SEM', 'EDS', 'd33 testing meter', 'Impedance analyzer', 'Ferroelectric comprehensive analyzer']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
