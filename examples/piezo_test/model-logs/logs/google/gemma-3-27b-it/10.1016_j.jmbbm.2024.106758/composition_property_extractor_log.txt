# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The aim of this study was to formulate a hybrid composite structure, BaTiO3/BNNT, aimed at augmenting the inherent piezoelectricity of BNNTs, while capitalizing on their commendable chemical, physical, mechanical, and biological characteristics. The conceptualization of this hybrid composite was grounded in the methodical synthesis of these two nanomaterials, BNNT and BaTiO3, employing similar processing conditions, specifically involving a preliminary ball milling process followed by high-temperature annealing (; ). Synthesis of BNNT and BaTiO3 was successfully achieved on a SiC plate utilizing a Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) technique, constituting what is herein referred to as the \u2018composite.' The required precursors for BNNT synthesis, namely colemanite and Fe2O3 catalyst, were amalgamated with barium carbonate (BaCO3) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) compounds. Following a 15-h ball milling process designed to reduce precursor size, enhance specific surface area, and optimize stored energy, the resulting mixture suspended in an NH3 solution was deposited onto a SiC plate. Subsequently, the assembly was introduced into the core of a tubular furnace, where the reaction unfolded at 1300 \xb0C for a duration of 3 h under the NH3 gas atmosphere. The NH3 gas flow was deliberately halted when the furnace temperature reached 975 \xb0C to promote the formation of BaTiO3, culminating in the collection of the composite from the SiC plate. The formation of the composite was initially investigated SEM, as seen in. In a comparative study with the same quantities of colemanite and catalyst as in a prior to BNNTs synthesis (1 g colemanite: 80 mg Fe2O3), and varying quantities of BaCO3 and TiO2, distinct morphologies were observed. When BaCO3 and TiO2 were maintained at 100 mg each, structures resembling BaTiO3 were predominantly present, yet no discernible BNNT formations were evident (a). Upon increasing the amounts of BaCO3 and TiO2 to 250 mg, BNNT structures commenced to emerge (b). Notably, when the quantities of BaCO3 and TiO2 were reduced to half of the colemanite amount, a more substantial presence of BNNT structures was achieved (c). Concurrently, BaTiO3 formations were subtly observed at the base of BNNT structures. The augmentation of BaCO3 and TiO2 quantities corresponded to an increased occurrence of BNNT formations, attributed to their catalytic influence on BNNT growth. However, when BaCO3 and TiO2 quantities equaled that of colemanite, exclusively BaTiO3 structures were observed (d). Based on SEM results, the composite synthesized from 1 g colemanite, 80 mg Fe2O3, 500 mg BaCO3, and 500 mg TiO2 was deemed the most suitable precursor ratio. In the SEM images obtained from a solid composite sample, BaTiO3 structures were not distinctly visible due to the extensive presence of BNNT formations on the surface. This facilitated the examination of BaTiO3 structures using AFM (f). In addition to the evident formation of BaTiO3 and BNNTs, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, as illustrated in , revealed the presence of various other boron nitride structures. The structural analysis of the composite was identified by FTIR, Raman spectroscopy, and XRD as depicted in. In FTIR spectrum of the composite, the peaks corresponded to characteristic peaks of BNNT were observed at 1347 and 756 cmE^{\u22121} (a). Certain shifts were observed in FTIR spectrum of the composite compared to the FTIR spectrum of BNNTs, which may be due to the BaTiO3 and other structural formations on the same synthesis plate. Characteristic peaks of BaTiO3 were not clearly observed due to suppression by broad and shallow peaks of BNNTs. The BNNTs typically give a sharp peak at 1367 cmE^{\u22121}. This peak shows the E2g plane model of the h-BN network and originates from the atomic vibration between the B and N atoms on the same plane. The peaks corresponding to BaTiO3 were observed at 714 cmE^{\u22121} while tetragonal BaTiO3 have four characteristic Raman peaks at about 261, 304, 517 and 715 cmE^{\u22121} as reported in the literature. It was also observed the peaks at 248, 282, 405 and 564 cmE^{\u22121}. These peaks could be attributed to the characteristic peaks of BaTiO3. However, there are some shifts at that wavenumbers compared to the peak values of BaTiO3 remarked in the literature. This shift in the Raman spectrum of composite as indicated in b could be due to the synthesis of BaTiO3 in the presence of colemanite, Fe2O3 and NH3 gas to obtain composite. Furthermore, the Raman spectrum and XRD plot (c) of the composite revealed the presence of different structural formations beyond BaTiO3 and BNNT in the synthesized composite. The XRD patterns of the composite displayed distinct diffraction peaks at 2\u03b8 values of 22.39\xb0, 31.72\xb0, 39.09\xb0, 56.62\xb0, 65.53\xb0, 66.53\xb0, 73.96\xb0, and 78.74\xb0, which correspond to the tetragonal structure of BaTiO\u2083 (JCPDS data No. 05\u20130626). Notably, the split peaks at approximately 44.8\xb0 and 45.5\xb0 are indicative of the tetragonal phase of BaTiO\u2083, which is crucial for its piezoelectric properties. In addition, the presence of diffraction peaks at 2\u03b8 = 27.03\xb0, 44.71\xb0, 59.14\xb0, and 82.32\xb0 confirms the formation of BNNTs (JCPDS Card no. 85\u20131068). The clear identification of these peaks aligns with previously reported BNNT structures, reinforcing the composite's successful fabrication. Beyond BaTiO\u2083 and BNNTs, the XRD plot also revealed additional peaks that suggest the formation of barium titanium bis borate (B\u2082Ba\u2086TiO\u2086) and titanium nitrogen boron (Ti\u2084N\u2083B\u2082) phases. Despite these secondary structures, the predominant phases remained BaTiO\u2083 and BNNT, both of which are known for their piezoelectric properties. According to the ICP-MS results, element concentrations in colemanite are higher than in all other samples except Fe. Washing of the composite with formic acid also caused the removal of carbonate residues. displays PFM analysis results of the composite material. The topography image highlights a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 0.47 \u03bcm and a peak-to-valley roughness of 2.7 \u03bcm, providing insights into the surface texture that may influence the piezoelectric behavior. The amplitude (b) and phase images (c) obtained through PFM for the composite material, alongside a topography image that reveals the surface characteristics. In comparison to the results for BNNTs in our previous report , the composite exhibited a higher and more pronounced PFM amplitude contrast, measured at 0.83 mV. The material undergoes polarization under the influence of an external electric field (AC), leading to expansion or contraction in response. As anticipated, variations in piezo-response were observed, given the composite's predominant composition of BNNTs and BaTiO\u2083. The PFM phase contrast exhibited a relatively weaker signal, indicating diverse polarities within different domains of the material. Furthermore, the piezoelectric properties of the composite material were evaluated using vertical (e) and lateral PFM (c) signals. The contrast observed in the vertical PFM signal indicates that adjacent layers within the material exhibit different piezoelectric responses. By acquiring the lateral PFM signal on the same area as the vertical PFM signal, it is gained additional insights into the piezoelectric response in multiple directions. Furthermore, the ability to switch the vertical PFM signal by applying either a positive or negative sample bias highlights the material's capacity for polarization reversal, which is another key indicator of piezoelectricity. The cytotoxicity of the composite on HOb cells was assessed with WST-8 colorimetric assay. In the experiment, HOb cells were subjected to the composite at varying concentrations for 24 h and the impact of nanomaterial on cell viability was investigated ( a). Cellular uptake of the composite was also evaluated on HOb cells using flow cytometry, revealing a significant increase in uptake with increasing concentrations compared to the control cells (b). Chitosan scaffolds were fabricated using the freeze-drying technique, enabling the creation of highly interconnected porous matrices, as illustrated by the SEM images in a and b. The pore size of the genipin-crosslinked chitosan scaffold ranged from 40 \u03bcm to 100 \u03bcm (a). The SEM images in emphasize the remarkably porous structure of chitosan-based scaffolds. The swelling ratio of chitosan was measured at 9.28 with US stimulation and 9.65 without US stimulation (d). For the chitosan-composite, the swelling ratio was measured at 6.63 without US stimulation and 8.81 with US stimulation. The compressive strength for chitosan was measured at 0.0367 MPa, whereas the chitosan-composite exhibited a higher compressive strength of 0.0536 MPa. The Young's modulus values for chitosan and chitosan-composite were 0.009 MPa and 0.0106 MPa, respectively. The compressive stress for chitosan was measured at 0.080 MPa, whereas the chitosan-composite exhibited a higher compressive stress of 0.095 MPa. The weight loss profiles, represented as a percentage versus time, for chitosan and composite-embedded chitosan scaffolds with and without US stimulation are presented in f over various time intervals. At the conclusion of the 120-day period, the weight loss percentages for chitosan and chitosan-composite were 36.17% and 28.61%, respectively. US stimulation did not significantly alter the degradation profile of chitosan scaffolds compared to those without US stimulation, with weight loss percentages at the end of 120 days measured at 35.48% and 29.09% for chitosan and chitosan-composite, respectively. The migration of HOb cells within chitosan scaffolds is evident in the fluorescence microscopy images presented in. The observed migration of HOb cells on chitosan scaffolds can be attributed to the larger pore sizes inherent in these scaffolds. Notably, green fluorescence predominantly emanated from beneath the surface of the chitosan scaffold until day 14. Subsequently, after 21 days of incubation, HOb cells were observed on the surface of the designed chitosan scaffolds. Furthermore, the cell population on US-stimulated scaffolds demonstrated an increase compared to scaffolds not subjected to US stimulation at the 21-day time point, as evident in the fluorescence images. Mean fluorescence intensities were specifically determined for day 21 samples, as at other incubation times, cells had generally migrated through the scaffolds, rendering them not readily observable on the surface. The application of US stimulation generated electric signals, facilitated by the piezoelectric features of the composite within chitosan. This contributed to the attachment and growth of electric-responsive HOb cells. By the end of day 21, a greater presence of cells was observed on chitosan scaffolds subjected to US stimulation compared to those without US stimulation. This effect can be ascribed to the mechanotaxis of cells promoted by US stimulation. To explore the morphology, attachment, and proliferation characteristics of HOb cells on chitosan scaffolds, SEM analysis was conducted at 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th days, as represented in. Although chitosan triggers the formation of bone mineralization, the minerals formed on composite embedded chitosan scaffolds were considerably higher when subjected to US stimulation. In addition, US stimulation increased cell attachment and proliferation at the time intervals of 14th, 21st and 28th days. By day 28, a distinct presence of cells was observed on the chitosan scaffold, consistent with the findings from the Live/Dead assay. illustrates the alkaline phosphatase activities (ALP) of chitosan and composite-embedded scaffolds, both with and without ultrasound stimulation (US). ALP, an essential membrane-bound tetrameric enzyme ubiquitously present in the body, is linked to glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol moieties on the outer cell surface, and it plays a pivotal role in osteoid formation and bone mineralization. The ALP activity reached its peak on day 3, showing comparable levels across all scaffold types. The ALP levels in the chitosan scaffold remained relatively consistent at day 14 and 21 compared to day 7. Notably, ALP activity was consistently higher in all scaffold types compared to chitosan alone from day 7\u201321. HOb cells on chitosan scaffolds responded to US stimulation, indicating heightened ALP activities over the 28-day period. Furthermore, a notable rise in ALP concentration was observed in US-stimulated chitosan-composite scaffolds compared to their non-stimulated counterparts on day 21. When compared with Chitosan-US, a significant increase was observed on the 7th and 21st days in Chitosan-composite-US. Mineral depositions on chitosan scaffolds, along with US-stimulated chitosan scaffolds, were visualized using von Kossa staining. Digital images of all scaffolds were captured for observation, providing front and back views of stained chitosan scaffolds with and without US stimulation on day 7, 14, 21, and 28 ( ). In , both front and back images reveal that composite-embedded chitosan scaffolds, with and without US stimulation, appeared darker compared to chitosan scaffolds alone on day 7. The front images of US-stimulated chitosan scaffolds grew darker with each passing day compared to non-stimulated scaffolds; a trend potentially linked to the ALP activity results. HOb cells exhibited a response to mechanical stimulation, contributing to increased mineral deposits. On the 14th day, front images of US-stimulated chitosan-composite scaffolds displayed more darkness compared to non-stimulated scaffolds. Both front and back images exhibited heightened darkness in US-stimulated chitosan-composite scaffolds on day 21. By day 28, all US-stimulated scaffolds appeared darker than those not stimulated, suggesting an ongoing positive influence of mechanical stimulation on mineral deposition.

# TITLE
One-step synthesis of a piezoelectric hybrid BNNT/BaTiO<inf>3</inf> composite and its application in bone tissue engineering

# INTRODUCTION
Piezoelectric materials (PEMs) are a class of substances that exhibit the ability to generate an electric charge in response to mechanical stress, or conversely, undergo mechanical deformation in response to an applied electric field. PEMs can be categorized based on their chemical composition such as boron nitrides, barium titanate, zinc oxide, and their dimensions such as nanowires, nanotubes, and nanospheres. Among them, barium titanate (BaTiO3), an inorganic compound having a general formula of ABO3 called perovskites, was discovered in the 1940s. In addition, BaTiO3 has recently attracted biomedical scientists\u2019 attention for its applications in implants due to its biocompatibility (; ; ) and piezoelectric properties  leveraging their potential for external wireless stimulation. BaTiO3 has a cubic structure as a titanium cation (TiE^{+4}) located at the center and surrounded by six oxygen (O) atoms at the center of all faces, and eight barium cations (BaE^{+2}) at the corners. BaTiO3 is typically a white powder but as its particle size increases, its color changes to transparent. There are several methods available to synthesize perovskite-type BaTiO3 powders. One traditional method is solid-state reactions, which are performed at temperatures higher than 1000 \xb0C under controlled pH and pressure (; ). BaTiO3 powder with a particle ranged from 28 to 105 nm was successfully synthesized through a solid-state reaction method using BaCO3 and TiO2 as precursors. This process involved a preliminary ball-milling step followed by heating at temperatures exceeding 1000 \xb0C. Note that the piezoelectric constant, d33, reached a maximum value of 190 pC/N when BaTiO3 was synthesized via conventional sintering of BaCO3 and TiO2. BaTiO\u2083 exhibits different crystalline phases depending on temperature. The transition to the piezoelectric tetragonal phase occurs as the temperature is reduced below the Curie point, approximately 120 \xb0C\u2013130 \xb0C. This phase transition is crucial because the tetragonal phase, characterized by a distortion in the cubic structure, enables the piezoelectric properties of BaTiO\u2083. Boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) also show piezoelectric activity and are considered as highly biocompatible. Discovered theoretically in 1994 (; ), they were first synthesized by Chopra N.G. in 1995. While BNNTs share structural similarities with carbon nanotubes (CNTs), they possess distinct physicochemical properties. BNNTs are electrical insulators with a nearly 6.0 eV band gap, unlike CNTs, which depend on chirality. They boast a Young's modulus of 0.5\u20131.2 TPa, rendering them exceptionally strong materials (; ). Comprising boron (B) and nitrogen (N) atoms, BNNTs adopt a cylindrical hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) structure with varying multi-wall, diameter, and lengths. Unlike CNTs' symmetric charge distribution, the charge distribution in BNNTs is asymmetric due to partially ionic B-N bonds, where electron density primarily shifted towards N atoms due to their higher electronegativity, resulting in a high band gap. Various synthesis methods have been developed for BNNTs, including arc-discharge (; ), chemical vapor deposition (CVD) (; ; ; ), substitution reactions (, , ) and laser ablation (; ). Among these, CVD is widely utilized in the presence of a catalyst such as cobalt, nickel, iron, and magnesium, under NH3, N2, or Ar atmosphere and at temperatures ranging from 1000 to 1900 \xb0C. In general, the CVD offers better control overgrowth parameters such as precursors, catalysts, and temperature compared to other approaches. BNNTs have been reported to exhibit superior mechanical features and higher stability against oxidation and heat compared to CNTs. In our previous study, we evaluated the use of BaTiO3 and BNNT comparatively in a non-conductive polymer, poly-\u2107-caprolactone, for bone tissue engineering, and found that both NMs improved the several properties of the scaffold. As an extension of our previous study, we synthesized a novel hybrid structure comprising BaTiO3/BNNTs, which are highly biocompatible and piezoelectric, employing a one-step synthesis procedure. The precursor compounds of Ba, Ti, B, and N were utilized to synthesize both BNNTs and BaTiO3 in the final product. Our approach, which involves a high-temperature solid-state reaction combined with CVD, allows for the simultaneous synthesis of BNNTs and BaTiO\u2083 within a single process, distinguishing it from other methods such as hydrothermal synthesis, as reported in the literature. The piezoelectric activity of the synthesized composite was investigated through Piezo-response force microscopy (PFM) and its performance in chitosan polymer scaffolds for the bone tissue engineering using osteoblast cells was tested.

# CONCLUSION
In summary, in this study a novel hybrid piezoelectric material was successfully developed through a one-step synthesis of BNNT and BaTiO\u2083. BNNTs provide exceptional mechanical strength, essential for supporting bone regeneration, while BaTiO\u2083 improves the piezoelectric properties, delivering the electrical stimulation required for electrically responsive bone cells. The hybrid composite showed substantial enhancements in mineralization, ALP activity, and cellular response to ultrasound stimulation, highlighting its potential in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering.

Certain shifts were observed in FTIR spectrum of the composite compared to the FTIR spectrum of BNNTs, which may be due to the BaTiO3 and other structural formations on the same synthesis plate. Characteristic peaks of BaTiO3 were not clearly observed due to suppression by broad and shallow peaks of BNNTs. The BNNTs typically give a sharp peak at 1367 cmE^{\u22121}. This peak shows the E2g plane model of the h-BN network and originates from the atomic vibration between the B and N atoms on the same plane. The peaks corresponding to BaTiO3 were observed at 714 cmE^{\u22121} while tetragonal BaTiO3 have four characteristic Raman peaks at about 261, 304, 517 and 715 cmE^{\u22121} as reported in the literature. It was also observed the peaks at 248, 282, 405 and 564 cmE^{\u22121}. These peaks could be attributed to the characteristic peaks of BaTiO3. However, there are some shifts at that wavenumbers compared to the peak values of BaTiO3 remarked in the literature. This shift in the Raman spectrum of composite as indicated in b could be due to the synthesis of BaTiO3 in the presence of colemanite, Fe2O3 and NH3 gas to obtain composite. Furthermore, the Raman spectrum and XRD plot (c) of the composite revealed the presence of different structural formations beyond BaTiO3 and BNNT in the synthesized composite. The XRD patterns of the composite displayed distinct diffraction peaks at 2\u03b8 values of 22.39\xb0, 31.72\xb0, 39.09\xb0, 56.62\xb0, 65.53\xb0, 66.53\xb0, 73.96\xb0, and 78.74\xb0, which correspond to the tetragonal structure of BaTiO\u2083 (JCPDS data No. 05\u20130626). Notably, the split peaks at approximately 44.8\xb0 and 45.5\xb0 are indicative of the tetragonal phase of BaTiO\u2083, which is crucial for its piezoelectric properties. In addition, the presence of diffraction peaks at 2\u03b8 = 27.03\xb0, 44.71\xb0, 59.14\xb0, and 82.32\xb0 confirms the formation of BNNTs (JCPDS Card no. 85\u20131068). The clear identification of these peaks aligns with previously reported BNNT structures, reinforcing the composite's successful fabrication. Beyond BaTiO\u2083 and BNNTs, the XRD plot also revealed additional peaks that suggest the formation of barium titanium bis borate (B\u2082Ba\u2086TiO\u2086) and titanium nitrogen boron (Ti\u2084N\u2083B\u2082) phases. Despite these secondary structures, the predominant phases remained BaTiO\u2083 and BNNT, both of which are known for their piezoelectric properties. According to the ICP-MS results, element concentrations in colemanite are higher than in all other samples except Fe. Washing of the composite with formic acid also caused the removal of carbonate residues. displays PFM analysis results of the composite material. The topography image highlights a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 0.47 \u03bcm and a peak-to-valley roughness of 2.7 \u03bcm, providing insights into the surface texture that may influence the piezoelectric behavior. The amplitude (b) and phase images (c) obtained through PFM for the composite material, alongside a topography image that reveals the surface characteristics. In comparison to the results for BNNTs in our previous report , the composite exhibited a higher and more pronounced PFM amplitude contrast, measured at 0.83 mV. The material undergoes polarization under the influence of an external electric field (AC), leading to expansion or contraction in response. As anticipated, variations in piezo-response were observed, given the composite's predominant composition of BNNTs and BaTiO\u2083. The PFM phase contrast exhibited a relatively weaker signal, indicating diverse polarities within different domains of the material. Furthermore, the piezoelectric properties of the composite material were evaluated using vertical (e) and lateral PFM (c) signals. The contrast observed in the vertical PFM signal indicates that adjacent layers within the material exhibit different piezoelectric responses. By acquiring the lateral PFM signal on the same area as the vertical PFM signal, it is gained additional insights into the piezoelectric response in multiple directions. Furthermore, the ability to switch the vertical PFM signal by applying either a positive or negative sample bias highlights the material's capacity for polarization reversal, which is another key indicator of piezoelectricity. The cytotoxicity of the composite on HOb cells was assessed with WST-8 colorimetric assay. In the experiment, HOb cells were subjected to the composite at varying concentrations for 24 h and the impact of nanomaterial on cell viability was investigated ( a). Cellular uptake of the composite was also evaluated on HOb cells using flow cytometry, revealing a significant increase in uptake with increasing concentrations compared to the control cells (b). Chitosan scaffolds were fabricated using the freeze-drying technique, enabling the creation of highly interconnected porous matrices, as illustrated by the SEM images in a and b. The pore size of the genipin-crosslinked chitosan scaffold ranged from 40 \u03bcm to 100 \u03bcm (a). The SEM images in emphasize the remarkably porous structure of chitosan-based scaffolds. The swelling ratio of chitosan was measured at 9.28 with US stimulation and 9.65 without US stimulation (d). For the chitosan-composite, the swelling ratio was measured at 6.63 without US stimulation and 8.81 with US stimulation. The compressive strength for chitosan was measured at 0.0367 MPa, whereas the chitosan-composite exhibited a higher compressive strength of 0.0536 MPa. The Young's modulus values for chitosan and chitosan-composite were 0.009 MPa and 0.0106 MPa, respectively. The compressive stress for chitosan was measured at 0.080 MPa, whereas the chitosan-composite exhibited a higher compressive stress of 0.095 MPa. The weight loss profiles, represented as a percentage versus time, for chitosan and composite-embedded chitosan scaffolds with and without US stimulation are presented in f over various time intervals. At the conclusion of the 120-day period, the weight loss percentages for chitosan and chitosan-composite were 36.17% and 28.61%, respectively. US stimulation did not significantly alter the degradation profile of chitosan scaffolds compared to those without US stimulation, with weight loss percentages at the end of 120 days measured at 35.48% and 29.09% for chitosan and chitosan-composite, respectively. The migration of HOb cells within chitosan scaffolds is evident in the fluorescence microscopy images presented in. The observed migration of HOb cells on chitosan scaffolds can be attributed to the larger pore sizes inherent in these scaffolds. Notably, green fluorescence predominantly emanated from beneath the surface of the chitosan scaffold until day 14. Subsequently, after 21 days of incubation, HOb cells were observed on the surface of the designed chitosan scaffolds. Furthermore, the cell population on US-stimulated scaffolds demonstrated an increase compared to scaffolds not subjected to US stimulation at the 21-day time point, as evident in the fluorescence images. Mean fluorescence intensities were specifically determined for day 21 samples, as at other incubation times, cells had generally migrated through the scaffolds, rendering them not readily observable on the surface. The application of US stimulation generated electric signals, facilitated by the piezoelectric features of the composite within chitosan. This contributed to the attachment and growth of electric-responsive HOb cells. By the end of day 21, a greater presence of cells was observed on chitosan scaffolds subjected to US stimulation compared to those without US stimulation. This effect can be ascribed to the mechanotaxis of cells promoted by US stimulation. To explore the morphology, attachment, and proliferation characteristics of HOb cells on chitosan scaffolds, SEM analysis was conducted at 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th days, as represented in. Although chitosan triggers the formation of bone mineralization, the minerals formed on composite embedded chitosan scaffolds were considerably higher when subjected to US stimulation. In addition, US stimulation increased cell attachment and proliferation at the time intervals of 14th, 21st and 28th days. By day 28, a distinct presence of cells was observed on the chitosan scaffold, consistent with the findings from the Live/Dead assay. illustrates the alkaline phosphatase activities (ALP) of chitosan and composite-embedded scaffolds, both with and without ultrasound stimulation (US). ALP, an essential membrane-bound tetrameric enzyme ubiquitously present in the body, is linked to glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol moieties on the outer cell surface, and it plays a pivotal role in osteoid formation and bone mineralization. The ALP activity reached its peak on day 3, showing comparable levels across all scaffold types. The ALP levels in the chitosan scaffold remained relatively consistent at day 14 and 21 compared to day 7. Notably, ALP activity was consistently higher in all scaffold types compared to chitosan alone from day 7\u201321. HOb cells on chitosan scaffolds responded to US stimulation, indicating heightened ALP activities over the 28-day period. Furthermore, a notable rise in ALP concentration was observed in US-stimulated chitosan-composite scaffolds compared to their non-stimulated counterparts on day 21. When compared with Chitosan-US, a significant increase was observed on the 7th and 21st days in Chitosan-composite-US. Mineral depositions on chitosan scaffolds, along with US-stimulated chitosan scaffolds, were visualized using von Kossa staining. Digital images of all scaffolds were captured for observation, providing front and back views of stained chitosan scaffolds with and without US stimulation on day 7, 14, 21, and 28 ( ). In , both front and back images reveal that composite-embedded chitosan scaffolds, with and without US stimulation, appeared darker compared to chitosan scaffolds alone on day 7. The front images of US-stimulated chitosan scaffolds grew darker with each passing day compared to non-stimulated scaffolds; a trend potentially linked to the ALP activity results. HOb cells exhibited a response to mechanical stimulation, contributing to increased mineral deposits. On the 14th day, front images of US-stimulated chitosan-composite scaffolds displayed more darkness compared to non-stimulated scaffolds. Both front and back images exhibited heightened darkness in US-stimulated chitosan-composite scaffolds on day 21. By day 28, all US-stimulated scaffolds appeared darker than those not stimulated, suggesting an ongoing positive influence of mechanical stimulation on mineral deposition.

One-step synthesis of a piezoelectric hybrid BNNT/BaTiO<inf>3</inf> composite and its application in bone tissue engineering

# INTRODUCTION
Piezoelectric materials (PEMs) are a class of substances that exhibit the ability to generate an electric charge in response to mechanical stress, or conversely, undergo mechanical deformation in response to an applied electric field. PEMs can be categorized based on their chemical composition such as boron nitrides, barium titanate, zinc oxide, and their dimensions such as nanowires, nanotubes, and nanospheres. Among them, barium titanate (BaTiO3), an inorganic compound having a general formula of ABO3 called perovskites, was discovered in the 1940s. In addition, BaTiO3 has recently attracted biomedical scientists\u2019 attention for its applications in implants due to its biocompatibility (; ; ) and piezoelectric properties  leveraging their potential for external wireless stimulation. BaTiO3 has a cubic structure as a titanium cation (TiE^{+4}) located at the center and surrounded by six oxygen (O) atoms at the center of all faces, and eight barium cations (BaE^{+2}) at the corners. BaTiO3 is typically a white powder but as its particle size increases, its color changes to transparent. There are several methods available to synthesize perovskite-type BaTiO3 powders. One traditional method is solid-state reactions, which are performed at temperatures higher than 1000 \xb0C under controlled pH and pressure (; ). BaTiO3 powder with a particle ranged from 28 to 105 nm was successfully synthesized through a solid-state reaction method using BaCO3 and TiO2 as precursors. This process involved a preliminary ball-milling step followed by heating at temperatures exceeding 1000 \xb0C. Note that the piezoelectric constant, d33, reached a maximum value of 190 pC/N when BaTiO3 was synthesized via conventional sintering of BaCO3 and TiO2. BaTiO\u2083 exhibits different crystalline phases depending on temperature. The transition to the piezoelectric tetragonal phase occurs as the temperature is reduced below the Curie point, approximately 120 \xb0C\u2013130 \xb0C. This phase transition is crucial because the tetragonal phase, characterized by a distortion in the cubic structure, enables the piezoelectric properties of BaTiO\u2083. Boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) also show piezoelectric activity and are considered as highly biocompatible. Discovered theoretically in 1994 (; ), they were first synthesized by Chopra N.G. in 1995. While BNNTs share structural similarities with carbon nanotubes (CNTs), they possess distinct physicochemical properties. BNNTs are electrical insulators with a nearly 6.0 eV band gap, unlike CNTs, which depend on chirality. They boast a Young's modulus of 0.5\u20131.2 TPa, rendering them exceptionally strong materials (; ). Comprising boron (B) and nitrogen (N) atoms, BNNTs adopt a cylindrical hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) structure with varying multi-wall, diameter, and lengths. Unlike CNTs' symmetric charge distribution, the charge distribution in BNNTs is asymmetric due to partially ionic B-N bonds, where electron density primarily shifted towards N atoms due to their higher electronegativity, resulting in a high band gap. Various synthesis methods have been developed for BNNTs, including arc-discharge (; ), chemical vapor deposition (CVD) (; ; ; ), substitution reactions (, , ) and laser ablation (; ). Among these, CVD is widely utilized in the presence of a catalyst such as cobalt, nickel, iron, and magnesium, under NH3, N2, or Ar atmosphere and at temperatures ranging from 1000 to 1900 \xb0C. In general, the CVD offers better control overgrowth parameters such as precursors, catalysts, and temperature compared to other approaches. BNNTs have been reported to exhibit superior mechanical features and higher stability against oxidation and heat compared to CNTs. In our previous study, we evaluated the use of BaTiO3 and BNNT comparatively in a non-conductive polymer, poly-\u2107-caprolactone, for bone tissue engineering, and found that both NMs improved the several properties of the scaffold. As an extension of our previous study, we synthesized a novel hybrid structure comprising BaTiO3/BNNTs, which are highly biocompatible and piezoelectric, employing a one-step synthesis procedure. The precursor compounds of Ba, Ti, B, and N were utilized to synthesize both BNNTs and BaTiO3 in the final product. Our approach, which involves a high-temperature solid-state reaction combined with CVD, allows for the simultaneous synthesis of BNNTs and BaTiO\u2083 within a single process, distinguishing it from other methods such as hydrothermal synthesis, as reported in the literature. The piezoelectric activity of the synthesized composite was investigated through Piezo-response force microscopy (PFM) and its performance in chitosan polymer scaffolds for the bone tissue engineering using osteoblast cells was tested.

# CONCLUSION
In summary, in this study a novel hybrid piezoelectric material was successfully developed through a one-step synthesis of BNNT and BaTiO\u2083. BNNTs provide exceptional mechanical strength, essential for supporting bone regeneration, while BaTiO\u2083 improves the piezoelectric properties, delivering the electrical stimulation required for electrically responsive bone cells. The hybrid composite showed substantial enhancements in mineralization, ALP activity, and cellular response to ultrasound stimulation, highlighting its potential in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering.
