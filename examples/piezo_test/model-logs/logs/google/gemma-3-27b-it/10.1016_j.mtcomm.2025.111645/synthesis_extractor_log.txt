Ceramic samples of Ba0.92Ca0.08Ti0.95Zr0.05-0.8 %La-xTm (BCZT-0.8 %La-xTm, x = 0, 0.1 %, 0.3 %, 0.5 %, 0.7 %, 1 %, and 2 %) were synthesised using the sol-gel method. High-purity materials, including Ba(CH3COO)2 (A.R.), Ca(NO3)2\xb74 H2O(98.5 %), Zr(NO3)4\xb75 H2O (A.R.), Ti(OC4H9)4 (C.P.), La(NO3)3\xb7nH2O (A.R.), and Tm(NO3)3\xb75 H2O (C.P.) were used as raw precursors. The raw precursors were added to an Erlenmeyer flask, and then ethanol was added to react for 3 h to obtain polymer solutions. Subsequently, the solutions were placed in the oven at 120 \xb0C for 10 h and then calcined at 900 \xb0C for 2 h in a muffle furnace to form precursor powders. Subsequently, the powders were mixed with 2 wt% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as an organic binder (the weight ratio of PVA and powders was 1:120) were formed into disks with a diameter of 20 mm under 20 MPa pressure with a retention time of 150 s. The disks were embedded in alumina and sintered at 1300 \xb0C for 4 h in air using a heating rate of 5 \xb0C/min. X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Smartlab, Japan) with Cu-K\u03b1 radiation was used to characterise the phase identification for precursor powders and ceramics in Bragg\u2019s angle range of 10\xb0\u201380\xb0. The sweeping rate, voltage, and current for XRD were 0.01\xb0/min, 40 kV, and 15 mA, respectively. The concentrations of oxygen vacancy were tested with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, K-ALPHA, UK). The microstructure on polished surfaces for samples was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Phenom Prox, Netherlands). A dielectric testing instrument (HDMS-1000V, China) and an LCR instrument (WK-6500B, UK) were used to characterise the relative dielectric constant (\u0511 r) and dielectric loss (tan \u03b4) of ceramics that coated a silver electrode in different frequencies and temperatures (30\u2013180 \xb0C). The radiant precision workstation (RTI-Multiferroic \u2161, USA) was used to obtain the polarisation-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loops under the electric field at 30 kV/cm and 2 Hz. The piezoelectric constant (d 33 ) was tested using a quasistatic piezoelectric meter (ZJ-3, China).

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a) and (c) display the XRD patterns of BCZT-0.8 %La-xTm precursor and ceramic powders, respectively, at 2\u03b8 = 10\xb0\u201380\xb0. The results indicated that the LaE^{3+} and TmE^{3+} ions were completely diffused into the lattice of the ceramics. At the same time, the precursor and ceramic powders showed strong and sharp XRD peaks, which proved that the ceramics had good crystalline structure. The trends shown in (b) and (d) for the characteristic peak (44\xb0\u201346\xb0) shifting to lower angles could be elucidated through the ionic radius. TmE^{3+} ions will occupy the B site of the ABO3 structure due to their small ionic radius (r = 0.869 \xc5). The ionic radii of TiE^{4+} and ZrE^{4+} (B site of ABO3) ions were 0.68 and 0.80 \xc5. Therefore, the characteristic peak shifts to lower angles due to the lattice contraction when TmE^{3+} ions replaced the site of TiE^{4+} and ZrE^{4+} ions. The relationship between diffraction angle and interplanar crystal spacing is shown by Bragg\u2019s law.  where d is the interplanar crystal spacing, \u03b8 is the diffraction angle, and \u03bb is a length of wave. Meanwhile, the 1:2 split of the characteristic peak is shown in (b) and (d). According to the PDF card (PDF # 79\u20132265), this schismatic characteristic peak occurs in ceramics when the ceramics possess a tetragonal (T) phase. To further study the influence on lattice parameters when TmE^{3+} ions enter the lattice, the XRD patterns (x = 0, 0.7 %, and 2 %) were refined using the GASA \u2161 program. The diminutive difference plot indicates that the refined data match well with the XRD patterns. Moreover, the confidence factor (R wp) ranging from 6.9 % to 7.7 % in , demonstrating the high reliability of the refined data. In addition, the refinement results likewise confirmed that the ceramics showed a T phase, which was consistent with the analysis of XRD patterns. The XPS results and corresponding fitting data for O1s for BCZT-0.8 %La-xTm ceramics with various x contents (x = 0, 0.3 %, 0.7 %, and 2 %) are showed in. The three peaks of the XPS spectrum from 527 to 533 eV consisted of the oxygen lattice (cation oxygen bonds), oxygen vacancy and absorbed H2O, successively. And the ratio of oxygen vacancies (OVacancy/OLattice) is exhibited in (e). The main reason for this was TmE^{3+} ions replaced TiE^{4+} and ZrE^{4+} ions, which led to a difference in the valence ( ). On the other hand, a large number of V O-Tm\u2032Ti/Zr dipole defects are produced when the oxygen vacancy concentrations are high. These dipole defects would accumulate near grain boundaries and domain walls, which affected the electrical properties of the ceramics through inhibiting grain growth, domain motion, and the switch of domain walls.  reveals the SEM images of the polished surfaces of BCZT-0.8 %La-xTm ceramics. And their grain size appeared to increase initially and then decrease when x changed from 0 % to 2 %. In addition, the lattice distortion inhibited the grain boundary migration when TmE^{3+} ions occupied the B sites, which was also an important reason for the reduction in grain size. (a) shows the temperature-dependent relative permittivity and dielectric loss of BCZT-0.8 %La-xTm ceramics with different x contents at a frequency of 10 kHz. In addition, the maximum permittivity of ceramics decreased gradually with an increment of frequencies ( ), which was attributed to the synergistic effects of diverse polarization mechanisms. shows the temperature dependence of inverse permittivity (10E^{4}/\u0511 r) of BCZT-0.8 %La-xTm ceramics at a frequency of 10 kHz, the temperature deviation and the relationship of ln (T - T m) assessed with ln (1/\u0511 r - 1/\u0511 m) of BCZT-0.8 %La-xTm ceramics with various x contents. The Curie-Weiss law and modified Curie-Weiss law are shown in. where C expresses the Curie-Weiss constant, T cw represents the Curie-Weiss temperature, \u0394T m corresponds to the temperature deviation of Curie-Weiss law (dielectric diffusion degree), T B is the temperature which the dielectric constant begins to obey Curie-Weiss law, T m is the temperature corresponding to the dielectric constant, C\u2032 is the modified Curie-Weiss parameter, and \u03b3 corresponds to the constant of diffuseness via the relationship of ln (T - T m) assessed with ln (1/\u0511 r - 1/\u0511 m). When the value of \u03b3 is 1, the samples show a normal ferroelectricity. With the incremental \u03b3 value at 2, the samples transform to a relaxor ferroelectricity. Slightly reduced \u0394T m and \u03b3 values were found when x contents changed from 0 % to 0.1 %. With the x contents continuing to rise, the \u03b3 values increased gradually to 1.4685 from 1.1950, and the \u0394T m showed an increasing trend. This phenomenon was attributed to the increased disorder and volatility of the local composition. illustrates the P-E loops for BCZT-0.8 %La-xTm ceramics. The remnant polarisation (P r) and coercive field (Ec) initially increased gradually with the increase of x contents, and the maximum P r was equal to 28.9 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} when x was 0.7 %. This outcome was attributed to the domains easily switched in a large grain size , and the distortion of oxygen octahedron when TmE^{3+} ions entered crystal structure. This result could promote the generation of V O-Tm\u2032Ti/Zr dipole defects, thus pinning the ferroelectric domains and causing increase carrier migration, which led to the P r for ceramic reduction. The results were consistent with the conclusion obtained via XPS spectrum analysis. The thinned P-E loops and decreased Ec with large x contents could be attributed to the presence of polar nanoregions (PNRs) and the disruption of ferroelectric long-range ordering. The piezoelectric constant (d 33) and mechanical quality factor (Q m) of BCZT-0.8 %La-xTm ceramics are shown in. The d 33 increased first and then decreased with the increment of x contents. Furthermore, the d 33 reached peak value when x contents were equal to 1 %. The distortion of the ceramics\u2019 oxygen octahedron structure was also a reason for the optimization of d 33. The Q m of samples appeared to have an opposite trend to the variation tendency of d 33 values, and the maximum Q m value was shown when x was equal to 2 %. Meanwhile, the d 33 displayed a decreasing trend when x contents increased from 1 % to 2 %. The phenomenon was due to the incremental concentrations of oxygen vacancy pinning the domains and domain walls, which led to the increase of Q m and the decrease of d 33. This finding was basically consistent with the results of XPS spectrum analysis.
