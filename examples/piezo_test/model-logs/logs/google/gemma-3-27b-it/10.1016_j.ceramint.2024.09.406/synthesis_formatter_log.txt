Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'Compaction and Poling', 'precursors': ['CaBi4Ti4-x (Nb2/3Mn1/3) x O15'], 'steps': ['Powder was compacted into a bulk of dimensions 15 mm x 2 mm x 2 mm.', 'Specimens were poled along the thickness direction.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['SEM', 'EDS', 'TEM', 'HRTEM', 'DMA', 'Compression test', 'Fracture strength calculation', 'Piezoelectric coefficient measurement', 'Ferroelectric residual polarization measurement', 'Stress-strain curves', 'Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
