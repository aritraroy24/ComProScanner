Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'DC reactive magnetron sputtering', 'precursors': ['Al', 'N2', 'Ar'], 'steps': ['Substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic cleaning system with Decon neutracon solvent for 5 minutes.', 'Substrates were cleaned in WashBryte solvent for 5 minutes.', 'Substrates were cleaned in deionized water for 5 minutes.', 'Substrates were dried under N2 flow.', 'Substrates were loaded into the deposition system under a residual pressure around 10E-7 mbar.', 'Al target was cleaned in pure Ar (30 sccm) at 300 W for 10 min.', 'Plasma was stabilized in a reactive atmosphere (Ar/N2) for 5 min.', 'AlN thin films were deposited using magnetron powers of 70 and 400 W, and Ar & N2 flows of 20 and 40 sccm.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['Profilometry', 'SEM', 'EDX', 'XRD', 'TEM', 'STEM', 'FIB', 'Berlincourt method']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
