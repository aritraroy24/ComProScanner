Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'Solid State Reaction', 'precursors': ['PbO', 'BaCO3', 'Nb2O5', 'Nd2O3'], 'steps': ['Weighing and mixing raw powdered materials (PbO, BaCO3, Nb2O5, and Nd2O3) in stoichiometric ratio.', 'Balancing lead loss during heat treatment with 6 wt% of PbO.', 'Adding methanol as a dispersing agent and mixing for 1 h.', 'Adding PVA (5 wt%) as a binder with a PVA-to-ceramic powder weight ratio of 1:20.', 'Pressing the powder into pellets using a uniaxial hydraulic press at 150 MPa for 3 min.', 'Sintering the pellets in an air atmosphere at 1150 °C for 4 h.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'SEM', 'Archimedes principle', 'EDS', 'Impedance analyser', 'Optical microscope']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
