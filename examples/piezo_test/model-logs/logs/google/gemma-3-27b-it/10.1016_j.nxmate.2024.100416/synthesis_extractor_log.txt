P(VDF-TrFE) with a molar ratio of VDF to TrFE of 75:25 was purchased from Kureha Corporation, Japan and diethyl carbonate, DEC (99 % purity) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The NBT-0.6CeO2 powders, with an average particle size of approximately 0.3 \xb5m, were synthesized according to the previously reported method. NBT-0.6CeO2 (0.05\u20130.25 vol%) was dispersed in a P(VDF-TrFE) matrix using 10 wt% DEC solvent to prepare the composite. Thin films (0.8\u20131 \xb5m thickness, depending on filler concentration) were fabricated by spin-coating onto glass substrates pre-coated with aluminum electrodes. A metal-insulator-metal (MIM) structure was formed by depositing additional aluminum electrodes onto the spin-coated films, allowing for the characterization of dielectric, pyroelectric, and ferroelectric properties. To optimize crystallinity, samples were annealed at 100\xb0C. The piezoelectric measurements were conducted on bulk samples prepared by solution casting method (thickness of 30 \xb5m) due to technical limitations associated with spin-coated thin films. XRD analysis was conducted using Siemens D500 diffractometer while Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) measurement was carried out using a Perkin Elmer 2000. The surface morphology of the thin films was characterized using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy FESEM (JEOL-JSM-7600F). The complex dielectric permittivity was assessed using an Agilent 4294 A Precision Impedance Analyzer across a frequency range of 40 Hz to 15 MHz, with a temperature variation of 25\xb0C\u2013120\xb0C controlled by a Lakeshore temperature controller. P-E hysteresis loops were measured using a Radiant Technology Precision LC Analyzer under a controlled applied field of 100 Hz at room temperature. A triangular waveform temperature was generated by a LakeShore temperature controller, and the resulting pyroelectric current (I p) was measured using a Keithly 617 electrometer. The short-circuited pyroelectric current of the films, I p, can be represented by the rate of change of polarization as shown in the following equation: I p = pA(\u0394T/\u0394t), where I p is the peak-to-peak pyroelectric current, p is the pyroelectric coefficient, A is the sample area and \u0394T/\u0394t is the temperature gradient. The piezoelectric constants of bulk, free-standing composite films were measured using a d 33 meter (model YE2730A). Prior to measurement, samples underwent DC poling at 65\xb0C under a high electric field of 200 MV/m for 60 min.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a) presents the XRD patterns of P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 composite thin films with varying volume fractions, \xd8. The peak at 2\u03b8 = 19.91\xb0 is assigned to the (110/200) reflection of \u03b2-phase crystal plane of P(VDF-TrFE) copolymer. The orthorhombic unit cell of the \u03b2-phase is packed with the CF2 groups with each chain aligned parallel to the b-axis and possesses a large spontaneous polarization P s. The diffraction peak at (110) plane (2\u03b8 = 30.3\xb0) corresponds to the perovskite phase of sodium bismuth titanate. The diffraction peaks at the plane (003/021) and (202/220) attributed to the rhombohedral-tetragonal morphotropic phase boundary of NBT. The intensities of the peak at the 19.7\xb0 is associated to the crystalline (110) and (200) planes of all-trans conformation. The crystalline conformation of the P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 composites confirmed by transmission IR spectra (see ). The infrared-active vibrations for copolymer are concentrated at the narrow range of 400\u20131500 cmE^{\u22121} due to the large mass of the fluorine atoms. The characteristic vibration spectra of \u03b2-phase P(VDF-TrFE) was observed at four intense bands of 510, 850, 1288 and 1400 cmE^{\u22121}. The bands at 510 and 1400 cmE^{\u22121} are referred to as CF2 bending mode within all trans (TTTT) segment along the chain and CH2 wagging vibration, respectively. The bands at 850, 876 and 1288 cmE^{\u22121} are assigned to CF2 stretching mode , while the band at 1174 cmE^{\u22121} assigned to the C-C bond. Infrared spectroscopy revealed no significant changes in the \u03b2-phase content of P(VDF-TrFE) upon the addition of NBT-0.6 CeO2, indicating that the filler does not induce phase transformations. Consistent with the decrease in crystallinity, the intensity of the P(VDF-TrFE) bands weakens as the volume fraction of ceramic fillers increases. presents the surface morphology of BNT-0.6CeO2 nanoparticles, pure P(VDF-TrFE), and P(VDF-TrFE)/BNT-0.6CeO2 composites with filler loadings of 0.15 and 0.25 vol fraction (scale bar: 1 \xb5m). Higher magnification images (scale bar: 500 nm) are provided as insets. The pure polymer exhibits a lamellar structure with rod-like crystallites of approximately 100 nm. At 0.15 vol%, BNT-0.6CeO2 nanoparticles are well-dispersed within the polymer matrix. However, increasing the filler loading to 0.25 vol% promotes agglomeration, potentially due to surface area effects and interparticle interactions. This agglomeration can contribute to the formation of conductive pathways which caused rapid decline in material performance (see Fig. 8 & 9 below). illustrates the frequency dependence of dielectric constant \u03b5' and dielectric loss \u03b5'' for P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 nanocomposites with varying ceramic filler content, measured at room temperature. The relationship between the complex dielectric permittivity, \u03b5 *=\u03b5\u2019\u2212i\u03b5\u201d and complex conductivity, \u03c3*=\u03c3\u2019+i\u03c3\u201d are expressed by the following equations, where, \u03c9 (= 2\u03c0f) is the angular frequency and f is the frequency. At lower frequencies, both \u03b5' and \u03b5'' increase with increasing filler volume fraction. The higher ceramic filler content leads to increased \u03b5' and \u03b5'' due to the space charge effect. Moreover, the NBT-0.6 CeO2 ceramic filler has a higher conductivity compared to the polymer matrix. As the volume fraction of this filler increases, its contribution to the overall conductivity of the composite also rises, leading to the observed increase in \u03b5''. The P(VDF-TrFE) composite was modeled by a two-phase dispersion system where phase 1 represents the polymer matrix; P(VDF-TrFE) and phase 2 is the ceramic fillers; NBT-0.6 CeO2. The effective dielectric constants of the polymer nanocomposite can be predicted from various theoretical models such as Furukawa , Clausius\u2212Mossotti , Maxwell and the effective medium theory (EMT). These models are strongly influenced by the size, shape and volume fraction of the fillers. presents the dielectric properties (measured at 1 kHz and room temperature) of P(VDF-TrFE) nanocomposites as a function of NBT-0.6CeO2 volume fraction. The Clausius\u2212Mossotti model which also assumes a simple binary composite, provides a reasonable fit at lower ceramic concentration (<0.05) but deviates from experimental data at higher concentrations. To account for the non-spherical morphology of BNT-0.6CeO2 particles (a), we also employed the Maxwell and effective medium theory (EMT) models. The EMT model incorporates a shape parameter, n. A value of n = 0 indicates a spherical particle, n = 1 represents a cylindrical particle, and n = 0.5 corresponds to a disc-shaped particle. Our experimental results were best described by the EMT model with n = 0.27, suggesting a non-spherical filler morphology which aligns with the observed square and rectangular shapes of BNT-0.6CeO2 particles in the FESEM images. The EMT model, considering the filler's shape, provides a more accurate representation of the composite's dielectric properties. Generally at the room temperature, two relaxation (\u03b1- and \u03b2-) processes observed in the P(VDF-TrFE) dielectric spectrum which are related to the crystalline motion. These relaxation processes were fitted using the Havriliak-Negami (HN) function : where \u03b5 \u221e is the instantaneous permittivity, \u2206\u03b5 is the dielectric strength, \u03c4 is the relaxation time, a and b are parameters describing the distribution of relaxation time and \u03c9 is the angular frequency. displays the observed and fitted spectra of \u03b5\u2032and\u03b5\u2033 of unpoled P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 composites across various volume fractions. A prominent \u03b2-relaxation peak, attributed to the crystalline chain segments of P(VDF-TrFE) was identified within the MHz frequency range at room temperature. Fitting the P(VDF-TrFE) data at room temperature yielded parameters: \u2206\u03b5 = 3.1, \u03c4 = 5.3 \xd710E^{\u22127} s, a =1, b = 0.81 for the \u03b2-relaxation. The intensity and peak position of this relaxation shifted towards higher frequencies with increasing temperature from 25\xb0C to 120\xb0C for both pure P(VDF-TrFE) and composite films. illustrates the resulting \u03b2-relaxation dielectric strength (\u2206\u03b5) and relaxation time (\u03c4) obtained from HN function fitting. The \u2206\u03b5of the \u03b2-relaxation initially increased with filler content up to 0.20 vol fraction, likely due to enhanced \u03b2-phase crystallinity induced by well-dispersed ceramic particles. However, further filler addition to 0.25 vol fraction led to a decrease in dielectric strength, attributed to filler aggregation, increased interfacial defects, and the formation of conductive pathways. In addition, the \u03c4 reduced with increasing filler concentration showing a similar trend, suggesting hindered polymer chain mobility at higher filler concentrations. The ferroelectric nature of NBT-0.6 CeO2 particles likely influences the relaxation behavior through interactions with the polymer's dipolar groups, potentially altering the trap level distribution within the composite films, as reported in. The P-E hysteresis behavior of P(VDF-TrFE) and P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 thin film composites at room temperature is shown in (a). The pure NBT-0.6 CeO2 ceramics exhibited a remanent polarization, P r of 560 mC/mE^{2} and a coercive field, E c of 5 MV/m, while the P(VDF-TrFE) polymer exhibited P r of 80 mC/mE^{2} and E c of 76 MV/m respectively. (b) shows the P r and E c of the samples with various volume fraction of ceramic fillers. Incorporating NBT-0.6 CeO2 ceramic as fillers has enhanced the remanent polarization and simultaneously reduced the coercive field in the composite system. When the volume fraction increased from 0 to 0.2, the remanent polarization was 166 mC/mE^{2} while reduced the coercive field from 76 MV/m to 55 MV/m compared with pure P(VDF-TrFE). However, adding more NBT-0.6 CeO2 above 0.2 vol fraction reduced the remanent polarization to 79 mC/mE^{2} even though the coercive field decreased. The enhancement of ferroelectric properties in P(VDF-TrFE) is governed by the conductivity in the series model. When the NBT-0.6 CeO2 increased to \u03d5 = 0.25, the pyroelectricity and ferroelectricity in the polymer phase were obscured by the direct current conduction in the parallel model. The internal fields, E and the electric displacements, D in the parallel model yields where subscripts 1 and 2 refer to matrix and fillers, respectively. When the electric field was applied during the polling process, the present of the NBT-0.6 CeO2 nanoparticles in the polymer matrix of P(VDF-TrFE) formed space charge layers at the interface between the ceramic and the polymer. The Maxwell\u2212Wagner\u2019s model considers the conductivity of the fillers of the composite thin film. Consequently, the space charges in the P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 nanocomposite can drift and accumulate at the boundary of the fillers and the polymer matrix interfaces at the faster rate to compensate for the discontinuity of the electric displacement at the location. The pyroelectric coefficient of the composite thin films with various volume fractions of NBT-0.6 CeO2 was plotted and shown in (b). The pyroelectric coefficients of the composite thin films increase proportionately with the increase of NBT-0.6 CeO2 volume fractions. The highest pyroelectric coefficient was obtained at \u03d5= 0.20 which is \u223c43 \u03bcC/mE^{2}K. This value is 34 % higher than the pure P(VDF-TrFE). Moreover, as observed in the ferroelectric result, we also see a similar trend with the pyroelectric coefficient of the samples with \u03d5= 0.25 where the pyroelectric coefficient is reduced to 35 \u03bcC/mE^{2}K. Since the value of \u03b5 2 is always found to be larger than \u03b5 1, thus, the local electric field applied on polymer matrix is much higher than the local electric field on the ceramic fillers. In addition, since the pyroelectric coefficient both NBT-0.6 CeO2 ceramic (650 \u03bcC/mE^{2}K) and the P(VDF-TrFE) (32 \u03bcC/mE^{2}K) have positive sign, thus, the ceramic and the copolymer phases in the P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 nanocomposite are poled in the same direction, consequently enhanced the pyroelectricity of the composite films. In the P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 nanocomposite, the formation of space charge layers at the interface is due to the presence of NBT-0.6 CeO2 ferroelectric nanoparticles. The nanoparticles\u2019 attraction causes copolymer molecules close to the nanoparticle interactive surface to become more mobile. This is due to the high ratio of free volume areas exhibited by nanoparticles (1000-fold higher compared to particles of micrometer size). In addition, the marked increase in the pyroelectric coefficient is attributed to the conductivity of the ceramic in the composite system, the phase structure of P(VDF-TrFE) and the promotion of non-homogeneous domain at lowered activation field in the absence of fillers. The higher volume fraction of NBT-0.6 CeO2 filler in a polymer matrix will contribute to higher d.c conduction in a nanocomposite. Thus, the optimum volume fraction of NBT-0.6 CeO2 dispersed in the polymer nanocomposite thin films should not be more than \u03d5= 0.20. shows the leakage current density versus electric field (J-E) plot of P(VDF-TrFE) and P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 thin film composites measured at room temperature. The leakage current density increases with the increase of electric field and saturated above 10 MV/m. From the graph, it is obvious that the leakage current increase from 10E^{\u22126} A/cm to 10E^{\u22123} A/cm with the increasing volume fraction of NBT-0.6 CeO2 ceramic from \u03d5 = 0.0 to \u03d5= 0.25. The leakage current in NBT-0.6 CeO2 is usually attributed to space charges, such as oxygen vacancies, which are induced by Bi volatilization during the sintering process and space charges between doping ion CeO2, and NBT with hole-carries. The piezoelectric constant, d 33, was measured for the bulk film (or free-standing film) of P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 composite at an optimized state for ferroelectric and pyroelectric properties. Only the optimized composite film with a volume fraction of 0.20, was the subject of investigation. The NBT-0.6 CeO2 ceramics exhibited a positive sign of d 33 = 90 pC/N, while the P(VDF-TrFE) polymer exhibited a negative sign of d 33 = \u221238 pC/N. The average of d 33 constant of 0.2 P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 was \u223c 49 pC/N. Thus, we have compared various P(VDF-TrFE) composites properties in the literature with our works as shown in. The piezoelectric constant and remanent polarization that we obtained from our work are i.e. d 33 = 49 pC/N and P r = 166 mC/mE^{2}, respectively. In addition, the poling field was also improved with the E c value of 55 MV/m at the low volume fraction, \u03d5 of 0.20. The observed piezoelectric constant and remanent polarization in our composite is notably high compared to literature values, especially considering the low volume fraction of 0.20. This suggests that the unique combination of NBT-0.6CeO2 and P(VDF-TrFE) in our composite effectively enhances the piezoelectric properties.

P(VDF-TrFE) with a molar ratio of VDF to TrFE of 75:25 was purchased from Kureha Corporation, Japan and diethyl carbonate, DEC (99 % purity) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The NBT-0.6CeO2 powders, with an average particle size of approximately 0.3 \xb5m, were synthesized according to the previously reported method. NBT-0.6CeO2 (0.05\u20130.25 vol%) was dispersed in a P(VDF-TrFE) matrix using 10 wt% DEC solvent to prepare the composite. Thin films (0.8\u20131 \xb5m thickness, depending on filler concentration) were fabricated by spin-coating onto glass substrates pre-coated with aluminum electrodes. A metal-insulator-metal (MIM) structure was formed by depositing additional aluminum electrodes onto the spin-coated films, allowing for the characterization of dielectric, pyroelectric, and ferroelectric properties. To optimize crystallinity, samples were annealed at 100\xb0C. The piezoelectric measurements were conducted on bulk samples prepared by solution casting method (thickness of 30 \xb5m) due to technical limitations associated with spin-coated thin films. XRD analysis was conducted using Siemens D500 diffractometer while Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) measurement was carried out using a Perkin Elmer 2000. The surface morphology of the thin films was characterized using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy FESEM (JEOL-JSM-7600F). The complex dielectric permittivity was assessed using an Agilent 4294 A Precision Impedance Analyzer across a frequency range of 40 Hz to 15 MHz, with a temperature variation of 25\xb0C\u2013120\xb0C controlled by a Lakeshore temperature controller. P-E hysteresis loops were measured using a Radiant Technology Precision LC Analyzer under a controlled applied field of 100 Hz at room temperature. A triangular waveform temperature was generated by a LakeShore temperature controller, and the resulting pyroelectric current (I p) was measured using a Keithly 617 electrometer. The short-circuited pyroelectric current of the films, I p, can be represented by the rate of change of polarization as shown in the following equation: I p = pA(\u0394T/\u0394t), where I p is the peak-to-peak pyroelectric current, p is the pyroelectric coefficient, A is the sample area and \u0394T/\u0394t is the temperature gradient. The piezoelectric constants of bulk, free-standing composite films were measured using a d 33 meter (model YE2730A). Prior to measurement, samples underwent DC poling at 65\xb0C under a high electric field of 200 MV/m for 60 min.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a) presents the XRD patterns of P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 composite thin films with varying volume fractions, \xd8. The peak at 2\u03b8 = 19.91\xb0 is assigned to the (110/200) reflection of \u03b2-phase crystal plane of P(VDF-TrFE) copolymer. The orthorhombic unit cell of the \u03b2-phase is packed with the CF2 groups with each chain aligned parallel to the b-axis and possesses a large spontaneous polarization P s. The diffraction peak at (110) plane (2\u03b8 = 30.3\xb0) corresponds to the perovskite phase of sodium bismuth titanate. The diffraction peaks at the plane (003/021) and (202/220) attributed to the rhombohedral-tetragonal morphotropic phase boundary of NBT. The intensities of the peak at the 19.7\xb0 is associated to the crystalline (110) and (200) planes of all-trans conformation. The crystalline conformation of the P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 composites confirmed by transmission IR spectra (see ). The infrared-active vibrations for copolymer are concentrated at the narrow range of 400\u20131500 cmE^{\u22121} due to the large mass of the fluorine atoms. The characteristic vibration spectra of \u03b2-phase P(VDF-TrFE) was observed at four intense bands of 510, 850, 1288 and 1400 cmE^{\u22121}. The bands at 510 and 1400 cmE^{\u22121} are referred to as CF2 bending mode within all trans (TTTT) segment along the chain and CH2 wagging vibration, respectively. The bands at 850, 876 and 1288 cmE^{\u22121} are assigned to CF2 stretching mode , while the band at 1174 cmE^{\u22121} assigned to the C-C bond. Infrared spectroscopy revealed no significant changes in the \u03b2-phase content of P(VDF-TrFE) upon the addition of NBT-0.6 CeO2, indicating that the filler does not induce phase transformations. Consistent with the decrease in crystallinity, the intensity of the P(VDF-TrFE) bands weakens as the volume fraction of ceramic fillers increases. presents the surface morphology of BNT-0.6CeO2 nanoparticles, pure P(VDF-TrFE), and P(VDF-TrFE)/BNT-0.6CeO2 composites with filler loadings of 0.15 and 0.25 vol fraction (scale bar: 1 \xb5m). Higher magnification images (scale bar: 500 nm) are provided as insets. The pure polymer exhibits a lamellar structure with rod-like crystallites of approximately 100 nm. At 0.15 vol%, BNT-0.6CeO2 nanoparticles are well-dispersed within the polymer matrix. However, increasing the filler loading to 0.25 vol% promotes agglomeration, potentially due to surface area effects and interparticle interactions. This agglomeration can contribute to the formation of conductive pathways which caused rapid decline in material performance (see Fig. 8 & 9 below). illustrates the frequency dependence of dielectric constant \u03b5' and dielectric loss \u03b5'' for P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 nanocomposites with varying ceramic filler content, measured at room temperature. The relationship between the complex dielectric permittivity, \u03b5 *=\u03b5\u2019\u2212i\u03b5\u201d and complex conductivity, \u03c3*=\u03c3\u2019+i\u03c3\u201d are expressed by the following equations, where, \u03c9 (= 2\u03c0f) is the angular frequency and f is the frequency. At lower frequencies, both \u03b5' and \u03b5'' increase with increasing filler volume fraction. The higher ceramic filler content leads to increased \u03b5' and \u03b5'' due to the space charge effect. Moreover, the NBT-0.6 CeO2 ceramic filler has a higher conductivity compared to the polymer matrix. As the volume fraction of this filler increases, its contribution to the overall conductivity of the composite also rises, leading to the observed increase in \u03b5''. The P(VDF-TrFE) composite was modeled by a two-phase dispersion system where phase 1 represents the polymer matrix; P(VDF-TrFE) and phase 2 is the ceramic fillers; NBT-0.6 CeO2. The effective dielectric constants of the polymer nanocomposite can be predicted from various theoretical models such as Furukawa , Clausius\u2212Mossotti , Maxwell and the effective medium theory (EMT). These models are strongly influenced by the size, shape and volume fraction of the fillers. presents the dielectric properties (measured at 1 kHz and room temperature) of P(VDF-TrFE) nanocomposites as a function of NBT-0.6CeO2 volume fraction. The Clausius\u2212Mossotti model which also assumes a simple binary composite, provides a reasonable fit at lower ceramic concentration (<0.05) but deviates from experimental data at higher concentrations. To account for the non-spherical morphology of BNT-0.6CeO2 particles (a), we also employed the Maxwell and effective medium theory (EMT) models. The EMT model incorporates a shape parameter, n. A value of n = 0 indicates a spherical particle, n = 1 represents a cylindrical particle, and n = 0.5 corresponds to a disc-shaped particle. Our experimental results were best described by the EMT model with n = 0.27, suggesting a non-spherical filler morphology which aligns with the observed square and rectangular shapes of BNT-0.6CeO2 particles in the FESEM images. The EMT model, considering the filler's shape, provides a more accurate representation of the composite's dielectric properties. Generally at the room temperature, two relaxation (\u03b1- and \u03b2-) processes observed in the P(VDF-TrFE) dielectric spectrum which are related to the crystalline motion. These relaxation processes were fitted using the Havriliak-Negami (HN) function : where \u03b5 \u221e is the instantaneous permittivity, \u2206\u03b5 is the dielectric strength, \u03c4 is the relaxation time, a and b are parameters describing the distribution of relaxation time and \u03c9 is the angular frequency. displays the observed and fitted spectra of \u03b5\u2032and\u03b5\u2033 of unpoled P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 composites across various volume fractions. A prominent \u03b2-relaxation peak, attributed to the crystalline chain segments of P(VDF-TrFE) was identified within the MHz frequency range at room temperature. Fitting the P(VDF-TrFE) data at room temperature yielded parameters: \u2206\u03b5 = 3.1, \u03c4 = 5.3 \xd710E^{\u22127} s, a =1, b = 0.81 for the \u03b2-relaxation. The intensity and peak position of this relaxation shifted towards higher frequencies with increasing temperature from 25\xb0C to 120\xb0C for both pure P(VDF-TrFE) and composite films. illustrates the resulting \u03b2-relaxation dielectric strength (\u2206\u03b5) and relaxation time (\u03c4) obtained from HN function fitting. The \u2206\u03b5of the \u03b2-relaxation initially increased with filler content up to 0.20 vol fraction, likely due to enhanced \u03b2-phase crystallinity induced by well-dispersed ceramic particles. However, further filler addition to 0.25 vol fraction led to a decrease in dielectric strength, attributed to filler aggregation, increased interfacial defects, and the formation of conductive pathways. In addition, the \u03c4 reduced with increasing filler concentration showing a similar trend, suggesting hindered polymer chain mobility at higher filler concentrations. The ferroelectric nature of NBT-0.6 CeO2 particles likely influences the relaxation behavior through interactions with the polymer's dipolar groups, potentially altering the trap level distribution within the composite films, as reported in. The P-E hysteresis behavior of P(VDF-TrFE) and P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 thin film composites at room temperature is shown in (a). The pure NBT-0.6 CeO2 ceramics exhibited a remanent polarization, P r of 560 mC/mE^{2} and a coercive field, E c of 5 MV/m, while the P(VDF-TrFE) polymer exhibited P r of 80 mC/mE^{2} and E c of 76 MV/m respectively. (b) shows the P r and E c of the samples with various volume fraction of ceramic fillers. Incorporating NBT-0.6 CeO2 ceramic as fillers has enhanced the remanent polarization and simultaneously reduced the coercive field in the composite system. When the volume fraction increased from 0 to 0.2, the remanent polarization was 166 mC/mE^{2} while reduced the coercive field from 76 MV/m to 55 MV/m compared with pure P(VDF-TrFE). However, adding more NBT-0.6 CeO2 above 0.2 vol fraction reduced the remanent polarization to 79 mC/mE^{2} even though the coercive field decreased. The enhancement of ferroelectric properties in P(VDF-TrFE) is governed by the conductivity in the series model. When the NBT-0.6 CeO2 increased to \u03d5 = 0.25, the pyroelectricity and ferroelectricity in the polymer phase were obscured by the direct current conduction in the parallel model. The internal fields, E and the electric displacements, D in the parallel model yields where subscripts 1 and 2 refer to matrix and fillers, respectively. When the electric field was applied during the polling process, the present of the NBT-0.6 CeO2 nanoparticles in the polymer matrix of P(VDF-TrFE) formed space charge layers at the interface between the ceramic and the polymer. The Maxwell\u2212Wagner\u2019s model considers the conductivity of the fillers of the composite thin film. Consequently, the space charges in the P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 nanocomposite can drift and accumulate at the boundary of the fillers and the polymer matrix interfaces at the faster rate to compensate for the discontinuity of the electric displacement at the location. The pyroelectric coefficient of the composite thin films with various volume fractions of NBT-0.6 CeO2 was plotted and shown in (b). The pyroelectric coefficients of the composite thin films increase proportionately with the increase of NBT-0.6 CeO2 volume fractions. The highest pyroelectric coefficient was obtained at \u03d5= 0.20 which is \u223c43 \u03bcC/mE^{2}K. This value is 34 % higher than the pure P(VDF-TrFE). Moreover, as observed in the ferroelectric result, we also see a similar trend with the pyroelectric coefficient of the samples with \u03d5= 0.25 where the pyroelectric coefficient is reduced to 35 \u03bcC/mE^{2}K. Since the value of \u03b5 2 is always found to be larger than \u03b5 1, thus, the local electric field applied on polymer matrix is much higher than the local electric field on the ceramic fillers. In addition, since the pyroelectric coefficient both NBT-0.6 CeO2 ceramic (650 \u03bcC/mE^{2}K) and the P(VDF-TrFE) (32 \u03bcC/mE^{2}K) have positive sign, thus, the ceramic and the copolymer phases in the P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 nanocomposite are poled in the same direction, consequently enhanced the pyroelectricity of the composite films. In the P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 nanocomposite, the formation of space charge layers at the interface is due to the presence of NBT-0.6 CeO2 ferroelectric nanoparticles. The nanoparticles\u2019 attraction causes copolymer molecules close to the nanoparticle interactive surface to become more mobile. This is due to the high ratio of free volume areas exhibited by nanoparticles (1000-fold higher compared to particles of micrometer size). In addition, the marked increase in the pyroelectric coefficient is attributed to the conductivity of the ceramic in the composite system, the phase structure of P(VDF-TrFE) and the promotion of non-homogeneous domain at lowered activation field in the absence of fillers. The higher volume fraction of NBT-0.6 CeO2 filler in a polymer matrix will contribute to higher d.c conduction in a nanocomposite. Thus, the optimum volume fraction of NBT-0.6 CeO2 dispersed in the polymer nanocomposite thin films should not be more than \u03d5= 0.20. shows the leakage current density versus electric field (J-E) plot of P(VDF-TrFE) and P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 thin film composites measured at room temperature. The leakage current density increases with the increase of electric field and saturated above 10 MV/m. From the graph, it is obvious that the leakage current increase from 10E^{\u22126} A/cm to 10E^{\u22123} A/cm with the increasing volume fraction of NBT-0.6 CeO2 ceramic from \u03d5 = 0.0 to \u03d5= 0.25. The leakage current in NBT-0.6 CeO2 is usually attributed to space charges, such as oxygen vacancies, which are induced by Bi volatilization during the sintering process and space charges between doping ion CeO2, and NBT with hole-carries. The piezoelectric constant, d 33, was measured for the bulk film (or free-standing film) of P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 composite at an optimized state for ferroelectric and pyroelectric properties. Only the optimized composite film with a volume fraction of 0.20, was the subject of investigation. The NBT-0.6 CeO2 ceramics exhibited a positive sign of d 33 = 90 pC/N, while the P(VDF-TrFE) polymer exhibited a negative sign of d 33 = \u221238 pC/N. The average of d 33 constant of 0.2 P(VDF-TrFE)/NBT-0.6 CeO2 was \u223c 49 pC/N. Thus, we have compared various P(VDF-TrFE) composites properties in the literature with our works as shown in. The piezoelectric constant and remanent polarization that we obtained from our work are i.e. d 33 = 49 pC/N and P r = 166 mC/mE^{2}, respectively. In addition, the poling field was also improved with the E c value of 55 MV/m at the low volume fraction, \u03d5 of 0.20. The observed piezoelectric constant and remanent polarization in our composite is notably high compared to literature values, especially considering the low volume fraction of 0.20. This suggests that the unique combination of NBT-0.6CeO2 and P(VDF-TrFE) in our composite effectively enhances the piezoelectric properties.
