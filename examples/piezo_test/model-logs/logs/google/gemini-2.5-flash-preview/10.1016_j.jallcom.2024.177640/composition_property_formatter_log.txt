**Description**: Format the extracted material composition and properties data. Focus on the 'Notes' if anything is provided. You MUST use 'MaterialParserTool' as tool if there is any variable in the composition in {'composition_extracted_data': {'compositions_property_values': {'2.5mol%Sm-0.72Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3': 1532, '2.0mol%Sm-0.5mol%Pr-0.72Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3': 1547, '1.5mol%Sm-1.0mol%Pr-0.72Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3': 1318, '1.0mol%Sm-1.5mol%Pr-0.72Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3': 1014, '0.5mol%Sm-2.0mol%Pr-0.72Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3': 819}, 'abbreviations': {'PMN-PT': '0.72Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3'}, 'property_unit': 'pC/N', 'family': 'PMN-PT'}}. You MUST use the final output from the material parser tool as the final answer for such cases. Just resolve the variables - but don't do any final numerical calculation to get the composition percentage by yourself and keep the formula same as the original.
- If any abbreviated form of composition is present rewrite with the actual composition. But DON'T modify the chemical composition / periodic element with chemical name / element name for e.g., Bi should not be replaced with Bismuth or BaTiO3 should not be replaced with Barium titanate.
- If composition has variables with equation, after resolving the variable the formula should be written in a form of BODMAS rule with only () as brackets, + as addition, - as subtraction, * as multiplication and / as division. For e.g, ABx-2y/5C3 is a chemical formula, where A, B, C are periodic elements and x and y are variables with values x=2, y=3, the final chemical formula should be written as AB(2-((2*3)/5))O3 so that BODMAS rule can be applied later.

**Parameters**:
- Extracted composition-property dictionary-

", agent="Material Composition and Property Formatter", status="completed", output="Thought: The user wants to format the extracted material composition and properties data.
I need to:
1. Replace any abbreviated forms of composition with their actual composition.
2. Check for duplicate entries (though there are none in this specific input).
3. Ensure the output format matches the desired JSON structure.

Looking at the input, the abbreviation 'PMN-PT' needs to be replaced with '0.72Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3' in all the composition strings. There are no variables to resolve using the Material Formula Parser tool in this specific case, as the "mol%" values are prefixes and not part of a variable substitution within the chemical formula itself. The "mol%" indicates the molar percentage of the dopant.

Let's process each composition:
- '2.5mol%Sm-0.72Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3' becomes '2.5mol%Sm-PMN-PT' -> '2.5mol%Sm-0.72Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3' (already expanded, no change needed for the base PMN-PT part)
- '2.0mol%Sm-0.5mol%Pr-0.72Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3' becomes '2.0mol%Sm-0.5mol%Pr-PMN-PT' -> '2.0mol%Sm-0.5mol%Pr-0.72Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3'
- '1.5mol%Sm-1.0mol%Pr-0.72Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3' becomes '1.5mol%Sm-1.0mol%Pr-PMN-PT' -> '1.5mol%Sm-1.0mol%Pr-0.72Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3'
- '1.0mol%Sm-1.5mol%Pr-0.72Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3' becomes '1.0mol%Sm-1.5mol%Pr-PMN-PT' -> '1.0mol%Sm-1.5mol%Pr-0.72Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3'
- '0.5mol%Sm-2.0mol%Pr-0.72Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3' becomes '0.5mol%Sm-2.0mol%Pr-PMN-PT' -> '0.5mol%Sm-2.0mol%Pr-0.72Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3'

It seems the compositions are already provided in their expanded form, so no direct substitution of 'PMN-PT' is needed within the composition strings themselves. The 'abbreviations' dictionary just provides the full form of 'PMN-PT' which is already present in the composition strings.

The task states: "If any abbreviated form of composition is present rewrite with the actual composition." The provided compositions already use the full form of PMN-PT, so no replacement is needed for the base material. The "mol%" prefixes are not abbreviations of the base material but rather indicate doping levels.

Therefore, the compositions are already in the desired format. I just need to structure the output as requested.
There are no variables like 'x' or 'y' in the compositions that would require the `Material Formula Parser` tool. The "mol%" indicates the concentration of the dopant, not a variable within the chemical formula itself that needs to be resolved.
Thought: The user wants to format the extracted material composition and properties data.
I need to:
1. Replace any abbreviated forms of composition with their actual composition.
2. Check for duplicate entries.
3. Ensure the output format matches the desired JSON structure.

Looking at the input, the `abbreviations` dictionary contains `{'PMN-PT': '0.72Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3'}`.
The `compositions_property_values` already uses the full form `0.72Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3` instead of `PMN-PT`. So, no direct replacement of `PMN-PT` is needed within the composition strings.
The compositions are already in their expanded form and do not contain any variables (like x, y) that need to be resolved using the `Material Formula Parser` tool. The "mol%" indicates the molar percentage of the dopant, which is part of the composition description, not a variable within the chemical formula itself that needs numerical resolution.

Therefore, I just need to reformat the given data into the specified output structure.
No duplicates are present.
No variable substitution is needed.
No abbreviations need to be expanded within the composition strings themselves as they are already expanded.{
