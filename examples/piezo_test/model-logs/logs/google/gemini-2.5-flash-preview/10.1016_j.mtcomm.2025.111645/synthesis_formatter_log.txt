", agent="Synthesis Data Formatter", status="completed", output="Thought: The user wants me to format the provided synthesis data.
I need to:
1.  Keep 'method' as 'sol-gel' since no allowed entities are provided for 'methods'.
2.  Keep 'precursors' as they are, as per the instructions.
3.  Keep 'steps' as they are, as per the instructions.
4.  Keep 'characterization_techniques' as they are since no allowed entities are provided for 'characterization_techniques'.

Therefore, I will return the input dictionary with no changes to any of the fields.{
