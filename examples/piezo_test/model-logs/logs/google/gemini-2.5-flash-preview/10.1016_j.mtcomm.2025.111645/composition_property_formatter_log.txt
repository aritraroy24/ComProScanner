**Description**: Format the extracted material composition and properties data. Focus on the 'Notes' if anything is provided. You MUST use 'MaterialParserTool' as tool if there is any variable in the composition in {'composition_extracted_data': {'compositions_property_values': {'Ba0.92Ca0.08Zr0.05Ti0.95O3-0.8%La-0.7%Tm': 181}, 'abbreviations': {'BCZT': 'Barium calcium zirconate titanate'}, 'property_unit': 'pC/N', 'family': 'BaTiO3'}}. You MUST use the final output from the material parser tool as the final answer for such cases. Just resolve the variables - but don't do any final numerical calculation to get the composition percentage by yourself and keep the formula same as the original.
- If any abbreviated form of composition is present rewrite with the actual composition. But DON'T modify the chemical composition / periodic element with chemical name / element name for e.g., Bi should not be replaced with Bismuth or BaTiO3 should not be replaced with Barium titanate.
- If composition has variables with equation, after resolving the variable the formula should be written in a form of BODMAS rule with only () as brackets, + as addition, - as subtraction, * as multiplication and / as division. For e.g, ABx-2y/5C3 is a chemical formula, where A, B, C are periodic elements and x and y are variables with values x=2, y=3, the final chemical formula should be written as AB(2-((2*3)/5))O3 so that BODMAS rule can be applied later.

**Parameters**:
- Extracted composition-property dictionary-
{'composition_extracted_data': {'compositions_property_values': {'Ba0.92Ca0.08Zr0.05Ti0.95O3-0.8%La-0.7%Tm': 181}, 'abbreviations': {'BCZT': 'Barium calcium zirconate titanate'}, 'property_unit': 'pC/N', 'family': 'BaTiO3'}}

The extracted output should look like the following-

{
  "compositions":
  {
    "Ba0.99Ca0.01Ti0.68Zr0.32O3": 375, 
    "Ba0.98Ca0.02Ti0.78Zr0.22O3": 350, 
    "Ba0.97Ca0.03Ti0.88Zr0.12O3": 325, 
    "Ba0.96Ca0.04Ti0.98Zr0.02O3": 300
  },
  "property_unit": "pC/N", 
  "family": "BaTiO3"
}

**Notes**:
- The unit, given here, along with other data, is just an example. It can change depending on the property.

The above thought process was incorrect. The instruction states: "If any possibility of variable substitution with fraction values is there in the composition use the material parser tool and rewrite the final composition. Just resolve the variables - but don't do any final numerical calculation and keep the formula same as the original."

While there are no explicit variables like 'x' or 'y', the percentages like '0.8%La' and '0.7%Tm' could be interpreted as a form of variable substitution or an additive. The `Material Formula Parser` tool is designed to handle complex formulas. It's safer to pass the composition through the tool to ensure it's parsed and formatted correctly, even if no explicit variables are present. This ensures consistency with the tool's capabilities and the instruction "You MUST use 'MaterialParserTool' as tool if there is any variable in the composition". Although not a typical variable, the percentages might be handled by the parser.

Let's re-evaluate. The instruction says "If any possibility of variable substitution with fraction values is there in the composition use the material parser tool and rewrite the final composition. Just resolve the variables - but don't do any final numerical calculation and keep the formula same as the original."

The current composition `Ba0.92Ca0.08Zr0.05Ti0.95O3-0.8%La-0.7%Tm` does not have variables like `x` or `y` that need to be resolved. The numbers are fixed coefficients. The percentages `-0.8%La` and `-0.7%Tm` are also fixed values, not variables that need resolution. The `Material Formula Parser` tool is for resolving variables like `Na(1-x)Li(y)TiO3 where x=0.1, y=0.4`. Since there are no such variables, using the tool might not change anything or might not be necessary.

However, the instruction also says "You MUST use 'MaterialParserTool' as tool if there is any variable in the composition". This is a strict rule. Even if I don't see obvious variables, it's safer to use the tool if there's any ambiguity or complex notation. The percentages might be interpreted by the tool.

Let's try using the `Material Formula Parser` tool with the given composition.
