The manufacture of the Ba0.85Ca0.15Zr0.2Ti0.8O3 (BCZT) powders was based on a solid-state reaction approach, as outlined in our previous work. Barium carbonate (BaCO3, \u2265 99 %, Sigma-Aldrich), calcium carbonate (CaCO3, \u2265 99.95 %, Sigma-Aldrich), zirconium oxide (ZrO2, 99 %, Sigma-Aldrich) and titanium oxide (TiO2, \u2265 99.9 %, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as raw materials and weighed according to the stoichiometric ratio. The raw materials were first mixed with ethanol and ball-milled for 24 h. The ethanol-ceramic slurry was then dried in an oven and ground into a powder for calcination, which was heat treated at 1250 \xb0C for 3 h with a heating ramping rate of 5 \xb0C/min. Finally, the calcinated powders were ground and sieved using a mesh with a size of 63 \xb5m. The resulting BCZT powder was used for the manufacture for both the dense and porous BCZT ceramics to create the piezoelectric elements. The dense BCZT ceramics were formed by uniaxial-pressing and high temperature sintering, in which poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the binding agent, which was mixed with the BCZT powders. The mixture was then uni-axially cold-compacted at a pressure of 80 MPa to form the green body. To sinter the dense BCZT ceramics, the green body formed by dry-pressing was heated to 500 \xb0C for 2 h using a ramp rate of 1 \xb0C /min to burn out the organic agents, followed by high temperature sintering at 1400 \xb0C for 10 h with a ramp rate of 5 \xb0C /min. The porous BCZT ceramics were manufactured with an aim to use the porosity to reduce the Young\u2019s modulus, density and acoustic impedance of the material. Compared to a porous structure with randomly distributed pores, an aligned porous structure enabled the material to have relatively high mechanical strength , a high level of polarisation by aligning the piezoelectric phase in a common direction, and therefore a large d 33 piezoelectric strain coefficient , which is beneficial for a high F Prop. During the freeze casting process, the BCZT powders were ball milled for 24 h with deionized water, a binding agent (PVA), and a dispersion agent (ammonium polyacrylate) to form a slurry with a solid loading level of \u223c20 vol%. The slurry was then poured into a cylindrical mold with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) on the sides of the mould and high thermal conductivity metal on the bottom. The slurry was then unidirectionally frozen at \u221280 \xb0C, and the ice was removed by freeze drying to form a porous BCZT green body. To sinter the porous BCZT ceramics, the green bodies that were formed by freeze-casting were sintered at the same condition of the dense BCZT, described above. To carry out the following characterisation and form the piezoelectric element of the swimming robot, the sintered BCZT ceramics in dense and porous form were formed into a dimension with a thickness of 1 mm and a diameter of 10 mm. The shell of the microrobot was formed by 3D printing of acrylic parts. A commercial digital light processing (DLP) 3D printer was chosen for the dual benefits of low cost and rapid prototyping capabilities. Inside the housing, the BCZT ceramics were mounted at the rear of the robot to generate the propulsion force, F Prop. A steel M4 nut was fixed at the front of the housing to increase the mass of the robot, which balanced the distribution of mass within the robot and enabled the robot to be fully submerged in the water while swimming. Two small holes (0.3 mm in diameter) were placed at the top of the central section of the robot housing to allow the wires to connect the external power source to the piezoelectric ceramic element. The acrylic parts of the swimmer were joined with a universal adhesive (UHU company), thereby encasing the piezoelectric material and the cellulose foam was attached to the structure using adhesive tape. As a raw material of cellulose, poplar wood powder was sieved through a 60 mesh and then chemically pre-treated. Firstly, the wood powder was soaked in sodium chlorite for 1 h at 75 \xb0C under acidic conditions. This step was repeated five times and then filtered to neutrality (pH = 7). Then, the wood flour was soaked in 5 wt% potassium hydroxide in a water bath at 90 \xb0C for 2 h to remove hemicellulose, which then filtered to neutrality (pH = 7). In order to obtain a higher purity cellulose pulp, the samples were treated with acidified sodium chlorite, twice, for 1 h in a 75 \xb0C water bath and once for 2 h in a 90 \xb0C water bath with 5 wt% potassium hydroxide. Subsequently, the cellulose was defibrillated using a high-intensity ultrasonic apparatus (800 W, 30 min) to obtain a 0.8 wt% suspension of nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC). Firstly, 3 wt% chitosan solution was prepared with 2 mol/L glacial acetic acid solute as the solvent, and the chitosan uniform dispersion was prepared by magnetic stirring for 8 h at room temperature. A 0.8 wt% nanofibrillated cellulose suspension and chitosan with a uniform dispersion were mixed at a mass ratio of 1:1 and stirred evenly to obtain a mixture. Then, 80 mL of deionized water was adjusted to pH = 4 using hydrochloric acid, and 2.5 g of trimethoxymethylsilane was added dropwise to hydrolyze. After magnetic stirring at room temperature for 10 min, the trimethoxymethylsilane reagent was added to the nanofibrillated cellulose/chitosan solution and stirred evenly to obtain a mixture. Under a vacuum with a cold trap at a temperature of \u221255 \xb0C and a vacuum degree of 1.0 MPa, the samples were freeze-dried for 72 h to obtain nanofibrillated cellulose/chitosan/silane composite aerogels. Finally, the composite aerogels were placed in an oven at 90 \xb0C and dried at a high temperature of 850 \xb0C for 3 h to obtain salinized nanofibrillated cellulose composite aerogels. The processing of BCZT ceramic and assembly of microrobot is shown in. The microstructures of the BCZT samples and nanocellulose were analyzed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Sirion 200, FEI, the Netherlands) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) system (Asylum Research, Oxford Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) and Computed Tomography (CT) scanning system (nanoVoxel-3000, Tianjin Sanying Precision Instrument Co., ltd, China). The contact angle of water and oil was measured at room temperature using an OCA 20 Contact Angle Analysis System (Dataphysics Instrument Analysis System, Dataphysics Instrument, Germany). The dielectric properties of the BCZT ceramics were measured using an impedance analyzer (Agilent 4294 A, USA) and the electromechanical coupling coefficient of the BCZT ceramics was measured with the resonance-antiresonance method. After poling the ceramics, the longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient, d 33, of the dense and porous BCZT ceramics was measured via the Berlincourt method (PiezoTest PM300, Singapore). The density of the BCZT ceramics was measured using the Archimedes method. A function generator (Isotech AFG21012) was employed to generate a source sinusoidal voltage signal which was amplified by a power amplifier by 200 times (2100 L, Electronic & Innovation, USA), see (b), and monitored by an oscilloscope (TDS 3014, Tektronix; Beaverton, OR). To limit any potential traction from the stiffness of the electrical wires that were connected to the piezoelectric element on the motion of the robot, thin electrically conductive wires (160 \u03bcm in diameter) were chosen to connect the power source to the electrode of the ceramics.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
As shown in -a(i), we consider a piezoelectric swimming microrobot that is driven by an AC voltage source at its thickness-mode resonance, where the robot generates an acoustic radiation force (F ARF) into a water medium, and the piezoelectric element is in direct contact with water. Using the converse piezoelectric effect, the piezoelectric disk vibrates in response to an applied AC in the thickness direction, where the disk is considered to be resonating in thickness-mode. As a result of the vibration of the piezoelectric material, an acoustic radiation pressure is formed at the interface between the piezoelectric material and the water medium, where, where p inter is the acoustic pressure amplitude at the interface, \u03c1 water and c water are the density of water and the acoustic wave speed in water, respectively. The terms \u03c9 and A are the angular speed and amplitude of the vibration, respectively. The acoustic radiation pressure is then transmitted to the surrounding water and the piezoelectric material by oscillating the medium (piezoelectric or water) at a particle velocity (u i). where t is time and x is the position along the vibration direction, with x=0 representing the position of the piezoelectric-water interface. When the acoustic wave is transmitting, the acoustic pressure (p i) in the water (p water) and the piezoelectric material (p piezo) is represented by,  Using the particle speed (u i) and the acoustic pressure (p i), the kinetic energy density (K i) and the potential energy density (U i) of the water and the piezoelectric material due to the acoustic radiation pressure can be obtained:  Therefore, the acoustic radiation pressure P i in the water and the piezoelectric material can be calculated as,  Due to the difference between the acoustic radiation pressure in the water P water and the piezoelectric P piezo, the resulting acoustic radiation force F ARF is given by: where S is the area of the vibrating surface of the piezoelectric material. As the acoustic radiation force F ARF and the acoustic radiation propulsion force (F Prop) are produced simultaneously, then:  Since the F Prop is highly correlated to a variety of properties of the piezoelectric material, including its density, piezoelectric d 33 strain coefficient and elastic modulus, we now examine how the introduction of porosity can used to tailor the magnitude of the F Prop. To achieve a high vibration amplitude (A), the piezoelectric element is typically operated at its resonance frequency (f 0). Since the acoustic pressure amplitude at the interface (p inter) is proportional to the angular speed of the vibration (\u03c9), as shown in , the AC voltage frequency should match the thickness-mode resonance frequency, f 0, of the piezoelectric element. For a piezoelectric disk, f 0 can be expressed as where h is the thickness of the piezoelectric disk, and Y and \u03c1 are the Young\u2019s modulus and density of the piezoelectric material, respectively. As a result, the introduction of porosity can affect the resonant frequency of the piezoelectric material by changing both Y and \u03c1, which thereby affects the acoustic radiation force (F Prop). The influence of porosity volume fraction on ceramic density (\u03c1) has a simple linear correlation, while its impact on the stuffiness (Y) is non-linear. Herein, the model proposed by Boccaccini et al. is used to describe the change in Y with the introduction of randomly distributed pores into the piezoelectric ceramic, as shown in (b) and once the impact of porosity on density and stiffness is known, can be used to determine the influence of porosity volume fraction on resonant frequency, f 0. (b) shows that the introduction of porosity reduces the resonant frequency since it reduces the elastic modulus to a greater extent than the material density. We now consider the impact of porosity on the strain when the piezoelectric disk vibrates at resonance at its thickness mode, where the vibration amplitude (A) can be assumed to be correlated to the longitudinal piezoelectric constant (d 33), which is a measure of the strain per unit electric field, where V is the AC voltage amplitude applied across the piezoelectric element. As shown in (c), the dependence of d 33 on porosity volume is described by a fitting formula based on experimental results from piezoelectric ceramics containing randomly distributed pores in Ref.. It can be seen that the introduction of porosity leads to a non-linear decrease in the d 33 with increasing pore volume fraction since the introduction of pores into the piezoelectric materials reduces the level of polarization. On considering the effect of porosity on d 33, an increase in porosity volume fraction leads to a decrease in the F Prop of the robot, see (c). The acoustic impedance (Z) describes the resistance to the propagation of acoustic waves through the medium, which is defined as the product of the density (\u03c1) and the acoustic velocity (c) of the medium :  For solid materials, such as the piezoelectric ceramics used here, the acoustic velocity (c piezo) can be expressed by the bulk modulus (B) and density (\u03c1) as  For homogeneous materials, B=Y/ 3(1\u22122\u03bd); where \u03bd is the Poisson\u2019s ratio. The introduction of porosity into the active piezoelectric element clearly has an inter-dependent influence on the F Prop generated by the robot; this a decrease in the resonance frequency (f 0), vibration amplitude (A) and acoustic impedance (Z piezo). Among them, a reduction in resonant frequency, f 0, and vibration amplitude, A, due to the introduction of porosity can be considered undesirable in terms of reducing F Prop. On considering the impact of porosity on all three parameters, the overall influence of porosity on F Prop is shown in (e), in which the F Prop can be observed to increase significantly with increasing porosity volume until the porosity volume reaches a relatively high level of \u223c80 vol%; the observed decrease in F Prop at pore fractions above 80 vol% is primarily a result of the very low d 33 coefficients and low amplitude at these high pore volume fractions, see (c). In summary, the modelling has shown that a porous piezoelectric with a porosity level lower than 80 vol% which exhibits a low acoustic impedance can enable a swimming micro-robot to achieve a high F Prop, exceeding that of a robot manufactured using dense piezoelectric materials. This is now experimentally validated in the following discussion and subsequent experimental characterisation. (b) shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the cross section of the porous BCZT ceramic, where the freezing direction is indicated. The freeze cast material exhibited a lamellar porous structure, where the pores are clearly aligned in the freezing direction; the porosity volume fraction was 49.5 % and the polarization direction along the direction in freezing. In addition, the computed tomographic (CT) image provides a 3D visualization of the porous BCZT, as shown in (c), where the vertically aligned pores introduced by the directional freezing of water can be observed. The freeze-casting process therefore successfully introduced a 2\u20132 porous structure into the BCZT ceramics. The dense BCZT fabricated by conventional uniaxial cold-pressing and sintering has a low porosity volume fraction of 1.4 %. The measured properties of both the dense and porous BCZT are summarized in , which include the density, porosity fraction, Young\u2019s modulus, relative permittivity at constant stress, and dielectric loss. The elastic modulus of the piezoelectric material, Y, was obtained from the electromechanical coupling coefficient (k t 2) as, where \u03b5 0 is permittivity of free space and \u03b5 33 \u03c3 is the relative permittivity at constant stress. Due to the introduction of porosity, there was a significant reduction in the relative permittivity at constant stress (\u03b5 33 \u03c3) and the Young\u2019s modulus (Y) of the BCZT. No significant change was observed in the dielectric loss (tan \u03b4) with the introduction of porosity. It is interesting to note that, after poling of the material along the freezing direction, the porous BCZT ceramic exhibited a longitudinal piezoelectric constant (d 33) that was higher than that of the dense BCZT; this has been recently observed for other porous BCZT ceramics. As a result of the high d 33 , the porous BCZT exhibited a high calculated electromechanical coupling coefficient at its thickness-mode (k t 2). The cross section of the nanocellulose aerogel was examined by SEM, see (e), indicating a distance of \u223c100 \u03bcm between adjacent pore walls of the aerogel, and the CT image in (f) provides a 3D visualization of the nanocellulose aerogel, which exhibits a 2\u20132 porous lamella structure. The microstructure of the pore wall was further characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), see (d). The hydrophobic and oleophilic properties were examined, and (h) shows that the aerogel exhibited excellent hydrophobic properties due to a high contact angle of 142\xb0, which was maintained on the material surface for over 120 s. In contrast, the aerogels displayed desirable oleophilic properties as shown in (i), in which an oil droplet applied to the material surface was gradually absorbed in 70 s and completely absorbed in 140 s. On applying an AC voltage across the piezoelectric element, it is able to vibrate and resonate in its thickness direction. Interestingly, the lower frequency radial mode (\u223c 0.4 MHz) indicates some damping by the robot housing, and this is likely to be due to clamping of the piezoelectric at its edges as it attempts to achieve radial resonance. As shown in (a), for the dense BCZT ceramics, the modulus of electrical impedance, Z, decreased with increasing frequency. The low frequency resonance peaks for the dense BCZT ceramic that are observed below 1 MHz are due to the radial resonance mode, and its third harmonic. The thickness-mode resonance of the piezoelectric element can be observed at a higher frequency of \u223c 2.28 MHz, where the electric impedance decreased to the minimum value at the resonance frequency and then increased to the maximum at the anti-resonance frequency. Using the same method, the frequency dependence of the electric impedance of the porous BCZT ceramic was measured, as shown in (b). In this case, no peaks associated with the radial resonance was observed below 1 MHz; this was due to the introduction of aligned porosity in the ceramic structure introducing significant damping in the radial direction that is perpendicular to the direction of the aligned porosity. Since the piezoelectric phase in the porous BCZT was aligned in the thickness direction due to the directional freezing, a clear thickness-mode resonance peak could be observed at \u223c 1.47 MHz. The reduction in the resonance frequency, compared to the dense material of the same thickness, is a result of the lower Young\u2019s modulus of the material due to the presence of porosity, see Eq. 1(b) and Eq. (11), which also reduces the acoustic wave velocity in the material. Only small differences were observed in the resonance frequency and the impedance amplitude in both the dense and porous BCZT ceramics, which may be due to the clamping effects of robot housing and water on the piezoelectric element. For example, (a) shows the data for the microrobot based on a porous BCZT ceramic that is subjected to an AC voltage with a voltage amplitude of 25 V at a frequency of 1.47 MHz as a result of the generation of an acoustic propulsion force, the robot moved along the tank with the displacement gradually increasing time. As a result, information on the displacement and speed of the robot at any time point could be extracted, as shown in (b) and (c), respectively; a video of the whole swimming event under 25 V at 1.47 MHz is provided in supplementary information. The distance moved by the swimming microrobots based on dense and porous BCZT ceramics for a range of applied voltage amplitudes are shown in (a) and (b), respectively. For comparison, the distance moved by the robot at the time of 2 s is marked, where the displacement increased with the applied voltage for the robots. In addition, the displacement of the swimming robot based on porous BCZT was larger than that of the dense BCZT. For example, at 2 s, the displacements of the robot based on the dense material at voltage amplitudes of 10, 20, and 30 V were 1.5 cm, 4.1 cm, and 7.4 cm, respectively. While for the porous BCZT for the same applied voltage, the distance moved was 2.7 cm, 9.0 cm, and 14.3 cm, respectively. This indicates that the robot using the porous BCZT ceramic moved faster than the robot based on dense BCZT. During the measurement of the swimming speed, the robot is assumed to be accelerated by a F prop that is generated by the AC voltage source. Simultaneously, the robot is assumed to be affected by the tensile drag due to the electrical wires (F wire) and an additional drag due to water (F water); this is described below, where m is the mass of the robot and x\u0308 is the acceleration of the robot. F water is considered to be a damping force, which is proportional to the speed of the robot (x\u0307) as described by, where r is the equivalent damping force coefficient of water. By substituting into , the displacement, x, of the robot can be determined as a function of time (t) as below. where A 0 is a constant, and \u03b4 is the phase angle between the x and the x\u0307. By substituting the m,x and t into , the remaining parameters can be determined by fitting; these include A 0, c, r, \u03b4 and F prop. The F prop obtained for the robots is shown in (b) as a function of the amplitude of the applied AC voltage, where it can be seen that the F propof the robots increased with the applied voltage. It can be seen in (b) that for the same applied voltage, the robot based on the porous BCZT exhibited a propulsion force, F prop, that was approximately twice as high as that of the robot with the dense BCZT. Therefore, such an improvement in the F prop for the porous BCZT is primarily due to the reduced acoustic impedance and lower piezoelectric element mass. The amplitude of the required driving current (I 0), for a given driving voltage (V 0 ), can be calculated via , where f 0 is the resonance frequency of the piezoelectric element, and C is the capacitance of the piezoelectric element. The power required for a given (V 0 ) is where P ave is a time-average power of the regular charging process of the BCZT ceramics from zero volts to V 0. Since the introduction of porosity reduces both the resonance frequency f 0 ((b) and ) and the device capacitance C (due to the lower permittivity, ), the porous BCZT ceramic required a smaller driving current and power compared to those of the dense counterpart. Specifically, at the driving voltage of 25 V, the driving current amplitude (I 0) and average power (P ave) for the porous ceramic were \u223c200 mA and \u223c4.6 W, while those were \u223c600 mA and 13.4 W for the dense counterpart, see (c). While a direct comparison is difficult since the working conditions (such as dimensions, voltage, frequency etc.) are different, the porous BCZT compares favourably compared to other robots.

When the acoustic wave is transmitting, the acoustic pressure (p i) in the water (p water) and the piezoelectric material (p piezo) is represented by,  Using the particle speed (u i) and the acoustic pressure (p i), the kinetic energy density (K i) and the potential energy density (U i) of the water and the piezoelectric material due to the acoustic radiation pressure can be obtained:  Therefore, the acoustic radiation pressure P i in the water and the piezoelectric material can be calculated as,  Due to the difference between the acoustic radiation pressure in the water P water and the piezoelectric P piezo, the resulting acoustic radiation force F ARF is given by: where S is the area of the vibrating surface of the piezoelectric material. As the acoustic radiation force F ARF and the acoustic radiation propulsion force (F Prop) are produced simultaneously, then:  Since the F Prop is highly correlated to a variety of properties of the piezoelectric material, including its density, piezoelectric d 33 strain coefficient and elastic modulus, we now examine how the introduction of porosity can used to tailor the magnitude of the F Prop. To achieve a high vibration amplitude (A), the piezoelectric element is typically operated at its resonance frequency (f 0). Since the acoustic pressure amplitude at the interface (p inter) is proportional to the angular speed of the vibration (\u03c9), as shown in , the AC voltage frequency should match the thickness-mode resonance frequency, f 0, of the piezoelectric element. For a piezoelectric disk, f 0 can be expressed as where h is the thickness of the piezoelectric disk, and Y and \u03c1 are the Young\u2019s modulus and density of the piezoelectric material, respectively. As a result, the introduction of porosity can affect the resonant frequency of the piezoelectric material by changing both Y and \u03c1, which thereby affects the acoustic radiation force (F Prop). The influence of porosity volume fraction on ceramic density (\u03c1) has a simple linear correlation, while its impact on the stuffiness (Y) is non-linear. Herein, the model proposed by Boccaccini et al. is used to describe the change in Y with the introduction of randomly distributed pores into the piezoelectric ceramic, as shown in (b) and once the impact of porosity on density and stiffness is known, can be used to determine the influence of porosity volume fraction on resonant frequency, f 0. (b) shows that the introduction of porosity reduces the resonant frequency since it reduces the elastic modulus to a greater extent than the material density. We now consider the impact of porosity on the strain when the piezoelectric disk vibrates at resonance at its thickness mode, where the vibration amplitude (A) can be assumed to be correlated to the longitudinal piezoelectric constant (d 33), which is a measure of the strain per unit electric field, where V is the AC voltage amplitude applied across the piezoelectric element. As shown in (c), the dependence of d 33 on porosity volume is described by a fitting formula based on experimental results from piezoelectric ceramics containing randomly distributed pores in Ref.. It can be seen that the introduction of porosity leads to a non-linear decrease in the d 33 with increasing pore volume fraction since the introduction of pores into the piezoelectric materials reduces the level of polarization. On considering the effect of porosity on d 33, an increase in porosity volume fraction leads to a decrease in the F Prop of the robot, see (c). The acoustic impedance (Z) describes the resistance to the propagation of acoustic waves through the medium, which is defined as the product of the density (\u03c1) and the acoustic velocity (c) of the medium :  For solid materials, such as the piezoelectric ceramics used here, the acoustic velocity (c piezo) can be expressed by the bulk modulus (B) and density (\u03c1) as  For homogeneous materials, B=Y/ 3(1\u22122\u03bd); where \u03bd is the Poisson\u2019s ratio. The introduction of porosity into the active piezoelectric element clearly has an inter-dependent influence on the F Prop generated by the robot; this a decrease in the resonance frequency (f 0), vibration amplitude (A) and acoustic impedance (Z piezo). Among them, a reduction in resonant frequency, f 0, and vibration amplitude, A, due to the introduction of porosity can be considered undesirable in terms of reducing F Prop. On considering the impact of porosity on all three parameters, the overall influence of porosity on F Prop is shown in (e), in which the F Prop can be observed to increase significantly with increasing porosity volume until the porosity volume reaches a relatively high level of \u223c80 vol%; the observed decrease in F Prop at pore fractions above 80 vol% is primarily a result of the very low d 33 coefficients and low amplitude at these high pore volume fractions, see (c). In summary, the modelling has shown that a porous piezoelectric with a porosity level lower than 80 vol% which exhibits a low acoustic impedance can enable a swimming micro-robot to achieve a high F Prop, exceeding that of a robot manufactured using dense piezoelectric materials. This is now experimentally validated in the following discussion and subsequent experimental characterisation. (b) shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the cross section of the porous BCZT ceramic, where the freezing direction is indicated. The freeze cast material exhibited a lamellar porous structure, where the pores are clearly aligned in the freezing direction; the porosity volume fraction was 49.5 % and the polarization direction along the direction in freezing. In addition, the computed tomographic (CT) image provides a 3D visualization of the porous BCZT, as shown in (c), where the vertically aligned pores introduced by the directional freezing of water can be observed. The freeze-casting process therefore successfully introduced a 2\u20132 porous structure into the BCZT ceramics. The dense BCZT fabricated by conventional uniaxial cold-pressing and sintering has a low porosity volume fraction of 1.4 %. The measured properties of both the dense and porous BCZT are summarized in , which include the density, porosity fraction, Young\u2019s modulus, relative permittivity at constant stress, and dielectric loss. The elastic modulus of the piezoelectric material, Y, was obtained from the electromechanical coupling coefficient (k t 2) as, where \u03b5 0 is permittivity of free space and \u03b5 33 \u03c3 is the relative permittivity at constant stress. Due to the introduction of porosity, there was a significant reduction in the relative permittivity at constant stress (\u03b5 33 \u03c3) and the Young\u2019s modulus (Y) of the BCZT. No significant change was observed in the dielectric loss (tan \u03b4) with the introduction of porosity. It is interesting to note that, after poling of the material along the freezing direction, the porous BCZT ceramic exhibited a longitudinal piezoelectric constant (d 33) that was higher than that of the dense BCZT; this has been recently observed for other porous BCZT ceramics. As a result of the high d 33 , the porous BCZT exhibited a high calculated electromechanical coupling coefficient at its thickness-mode (k t 2). The cross section of the nanocellulose aerogel was examined by SEM, see (e), indicating a distance of \u223c100 \u03bcm between adjacent pore walls of the aerogel, and the CT image in (f) provides a 3D visualization of the nanocellulose aerogel, which exhibits a 2\u20132 porous lamella structure. The microstructure of the pore wall was further characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), see (d). The hydrophobic and oleophilic properties were examined, and (h) shows that the aerogel exhibited excellent hydrophobic properties due to a high contact angle of 142\xb0, which was maintained on the material surface for over 120 s. In contrast, the aerogels displayed desirable oleophilic properties as shown in (i), in which an oil droplet applied to the material surface was gradually absorbed in 70 s and completely absorbed in 140 s. On applying an AC voltage across the piezoelectric element, it is able to vibrate and resonate in its thickness direction. Interestingly, the lower frequency radial mode (\u223c 0.4 MHz) indicates some damping by the robot housing, and this is likely to be due to clamping of the piezoelectric at its edges as it attempts to achieve radial resonance. As shown in (a), for the dense BCZT ceramics, the modulus of electrical impedance, Z, decreased with increasing frequency. The low frequency resonance peaks for the dense BCZT ceramic that are observed below 1 MHz are due to the radial resonance mode, and its third harmonic. The thickness-mode resonance of the piezoelectric element can be observed at a higher frequency of \u223c 2.28 MHz, where the electric impedance decreased to the minimum value at the resonance frequency and then increased to the maximum at the anti-resonance frequency. Using the same method, the frequency dependence of the electric impedance of the porous BCZT ceramic was measured, as shown in (b). In this case, no peaks associated with the radial resonance was observed below 1 MHz; this was due to the introduction of aligned porosity in the ceramic structure introducing significant damping in the radial direction that is perpendicular to the direction of the aligned porosity. Since the piezoelectric phase in the porous BCZT was aligned in the thickness direction due to the directional freezing, a clear thickness-mode resonance peak could be observed at \u223c 1.47 MHz. The reduction in the resonance frequency, compared to the dense material of the same thickness, is a result of the lower Young\u2019s modulus of the material due to the presence of porosity, see Eq. 1(b) and Eq. (11), which also reduces the acoustic wave velocity in the material. Only small differences were observed in the resonance frequency and the impedance amplitude in both the dense and porous BCZT ceramics, which may be due to the clamping effects of robot housing and water on the piezoelectric element. For example, (a) shows the data for the microrobot based on a porous BCZT ceramic that is subjected to an AC voltage with a voltage amplitude of 25 V at a frequency of 1.47 MHz as a result of the generation of an acoustic propulsion force, the robot moved along the tank with the displacement gradually increasing time. As a result, information on the displacement and speed of the robot at any time point could be extracted, as shown in (b) and (c), respectively; a video of the whole swimming event under 25 V at 1.47 MHz is provided in supplementary information. The distance moved by the swimming microrobots based on dense and porous BCZT ceramics for a range of applied voltage amplitudes are shown in (a) and (b), respectively. For comparison, the distance moved by the robot at the time of 2 s is marked, where the displacement increased with the applied voltage for the robots. In addition, the displacement of the swimming robot based on porous BCZT was larger than that of the dense BCZT. For example, at 2 s, the displacements of the robot based on the dense material at voltage amplitudes of 10, 20, and 30 V were 1.5 cm, 4.1 cm, and 7.4 cm, respectively. While for the porous BCZT for the same applied voltage, the distance moved was 2.7 cm, 9.0 cm, and 14.3 cm, respectively. This indicates that the robot using the porous BCZT ceramic moved faster than the robot based on dense BCZT. During the measurement of the swimming speed, the robot is assumed to be accelerated by a F prop that is generated by the AC voltage source. Simultaneously, the robot is assumed to be affected by the tensile drag due to the electrical wires (F wire) and an additional drag due to water (F water); this is described below, where m is the mass of the robot and x\u0308 is the acceleration of the robot. F water is considered to be a damping force, which is proportional to the speed of the robot (x\u0307) as described by, where r is the equivalent damping force coefficient of water. By substituting into , the displacement, x, of the robot can be determined as a function of time (t) as below. where A 0 is a constant, and \u03b4 is the phase angle between the x and the x\u0307. By substituting the m,x and t into , the remaining parameters can be determined by fitting; these include A 0, c, r, \u03b4 and F prop. The F prop obtained for the robots is shown in (b) as a function of the amplitude of the applied AC voltage, where it can be seen that the F propof the robots increased with the applied voltage. It can be seen in (b) that for the same applied voltage, the robot based on the porous BCZT exhibited a propulsion force, F prop, that was approximately twice as high as that of the robot with the dense BCZT. Therefore, such an improvement in the F prop for the porous BCZT is primarily due to the reduced acoustic impedance and lower piezoelectric element mass. The amplitude of the required driving current (I 0), for a given driving voltage (V 0 ), can be calculated via , where f 0 is the resonance frequency of the piezoelectric element, and C is the capacitance of the piezoelectric element. The power required for a given (V 0 ) is where P ave is a time-average power of the regular charging process of the BCZT ceramics from zero volts to V 0. Since the introduction of porosity reduces both the resonance frequency f 0 ((b) and ) and the device capacitance C (due to the lower permittivity, ), the porous BCZT ceramic required a smaller driving current and power compared to those of the dense counterpart. Specifically, at the driving voltage of 25 V, the driving current amplitude (I 0) and average power (P ave) for the porous ceramic were \u223c200 mA and \u223c4.6 W, while those were \u223c600 mA and 13.4 W for the dense counterpart, see (c). While a direct comparison is difficult since the working conditions (such as dimensions, voltage, frequency etc.) are different, the porous BCZT compares favourably compared to other robots.

I will combine all the synthesis steps and characterization techniques into a single JSON output, as the request asks for a general synthesis data extraction from the text. The precursors will be a combined list from all synthesis processes.

Let's refine the lists for the final JSON.

**Method:**
The text describes several methods:
*   Solid-state reaction (for BCZT powder)

Since the prompt asks for "method" (singular), I should choose the most overarching or primary method if possible, or list them if they are distinct for different materials. Given the prompt's structure, it seems to imply a single method for the overall synthesis described. However, the text clearly outlines distinct synthesis routes for different components (BCZT, acrylic, nanocellulose aerogel). I will list the primary methods for the main materials. The prompt asks for "the synthesis data", implying a single output for all. I will combine the methods into a list or pick the most prominent one. Given the structure of the expected output, it's a single string for "method". This is tricky. I will choose "Solid-state reaction, Uniaxial-pressing, Freeze casting, 3D printing, Chemical pre-treatment, Ultrasonic defibrillation, Solution mixing, Hydrolysis, Freeze-drying, High-temperature drying" as a comprehensive string.

**Precursors:**
Combine all precursors mentioned:
Barium carbonate, Calcium carbonate, Zirconium oxide, Titanium oxide, Ethanol, Poly(vinyl alcohol), Deionized water, Ammonium polyacrylate, Polydimethylsilsiloxane (PDMS) (used in mold, not directly a precursor for the material itself, but part of the process setup), Poplar wood powder, Sodium chlorite, Potassium hydroxide, Chitosan, Glacial acetic acid, Hydrochloric acid, Trimethoxymethylsilane. I will exclude PDMS as it's a mold material, not a precursor incorporated into the final material.

**Steps:**
Combine all distinct steps in chronological order where possible, or group by material. This will be a long list.

**Characterization Techniques:**
Combine all characterization techniques mentioned.

Let's re-evaluate the "method" key. The prompt asks for "method" (singular string). This implies a single, overarching method or the most dominant one. However, the text describes the synthesis of multiple distinct materials (BCZT ceramics, acrylic parts, nanocellulose aerogels) each with its own method. If I have to pick one, it's impossible to represent all. If I concatenate them, it might not fit the "method" singular string. I will list the primary methods as a comma-separated string.

Let's refine the "method" to be a concise summary of the main synthesis approaches.
"Solid-state reaction, Uniaxial pressing, Freeze casting, 3D printing, Chemical treatment, Ultrasonic defibrillation, Solution processing, Freeze-drying, High-temperature drying"

For precursors, I will list all chemical names.
For steps, I will list all distinct steps in a logical flow.
For characterization techniques, I will list all mentioned techniques.```json
