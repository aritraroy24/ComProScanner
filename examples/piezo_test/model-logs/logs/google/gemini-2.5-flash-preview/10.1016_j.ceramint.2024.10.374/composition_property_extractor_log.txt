# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The XRD patterns of KNN powders calcined at different temperatures are shown in , which indicates that a perovskite structure has been obtained after calcination of all powders. The extensive researches have argued that the reactions of alkali carbonates and niobium pentoxide will be between 300 \xb0C to 700 \xb0C, and a pure perovskite structure could be constructed when the temperature is higher than 700 \xb0C. In our case, apart from expected KNN perovskite peaks, the shoulder distributed at a higher angle of each diffraction peak are observed in all powders (black arrow), which can be indexed to NaNbO3 (NN) (PDF#01-071-0947). Therefore, the coexistence of multiple phases indicated by the splitting of multiple diffraction peaks in all powder mixtures suggests the chemical inhomogeneity of A-site elements in KNN perovskite. To clearly characterize the chemical inhomogeneity of calcined powder, the refined {110} peak fitted via the Gauss-Lorentz function according to diffraction peaks of NaNbO3 (NN) (PDF#01-071-0947, red index line) and KNbO3 (KN) (PDF#01-071-0947, light blue index line) are presented in. According to the PDF card, three fitting peaks from left to right correspond to KNbO3, K-rich KNN, and NaNbO3, respectively. Meanwhile, KNbO3 almost diminishes after increasing the calcination temperature up to 900 \xb0C. Additionally, after second ball milling, the diffraction peak of KNbO3 almost disappears while the diffraction peak of NaNbO3 is weakened, especially under the condition that the calcination temperature is enhanced up to 900 \xb0C ((g and h)). In order to further determine the composition heterogeneity of different powders, EDS elemental analysis of powders calcined at different temperatures after once and twice ball milling is presented in , respectively. To accurately characterize the chemical heterogeneity, EDS spectra near both larger and smaller particles are tested to semiquantitatively determine element content. Meanwhile, most particles are mainly Na-rich phase, and only a slight of K-rich phase is detected , owing to that Na2CO3 has higher reactivity to react with Nb2O5/ZrO2 than K2CO3, which was also confirmed by other researches. Furthermore, the EDS spectra of KNN powders after twice ball milling are presented in. Although there is still composition heterogeneity between K and Na, the K/Na ratios are close to 1:1, especially when the calcination temperature enhances up to 900 \xb0C. It can be noted that a fraction of abnormal large particle clusters exists (>5 \u03bcm) along with aggregated fine particles (\u223c1 \u03bcm) in powders mixture without twice ball milling, when the calcination temperature is higher than 900 \xb0C. Particularly, as the calcination temperature increases to 950 \xb0C, the formation of particle clusters and serious agglomeration phenomenon exists in 950-1st powder , associating with the slightly decreased AGS, which could be caused by inhomogeneous stress distribution by increasing calcination temperatures. Besides, compared with powder calcined at 900 \xb0C, the formation rate and number of crystal nucleus could be increased when the calcination temperature increases to 950 \xb0C, which induces the competition among crystal nucleus being more serious, thus, the particle size of 950-1st and 950-2nd slightly decreases. Herein, the bimodal particle size distribution in calcined powders is referred as irregular grain growth behavior, which can easily cause abnormal grain growth (AGG) in bulk ceramics. Note ball milling can successfully destroy particle clusters, and the agglomeration phenomenon is alleviated after twice ball milling in KNN-based calcined powder, meanwhile the maximum grain size decreases. The morphology of calcined powders exhibits relatively uniform average grain size (AGS) after twice ball milling, and the chemical heterogeneity is relieved to a certain extent , owing to the increased pressures of the collisions and destruction of abnormal particle clusters after the ball milling. Besides, after twice ball milling, the largest AGS is obtained in 900-2nd powders , and the modification of particle size and distribution of powder mixtures may affect size-dependent grain growth in the final two-step sintering process. is XRD diffraction patterns of as-sintered ceramics, which demonstrate that CZ ceramics with different calcination temperatures under both once or twice ball milling obtain a pure perovskite phase structure, indicating ternary components are dissolved into the lattice to form a pure solid solution. All samples display splitting {200}PC diffraction peaks ((a)), suggesting that the phase structure KNN-BNZ system can be well remained under different preparation processes. Additionally, to confirm the phase evolution as a function of different preparation processes, the refined XRD data of {200} re\ufb02ection peaks fitted via the Gauss-Lorentz function are presented in (b\u2013e). One can see that the polymorphic boundary is retained in all ceramics, and all CZ ceramics prepared by different processes exhibit similar rhombohedral-tetragonal (R-T) phase coexistence, which is consistent with other researches. Additionally, the content of tetragonal (T) and rhombohedral (R) phases in different processes is also collected in the inset of (b\u2013e), while more content of the T phase can be observed regardless of improving calcination temperatures or undergone secondary ball milling. It was reported that the content of T phase a\ufb00ected the piezoelectricity of piezoceramics, while larger piezoelectricity could be observed in the ceramics with higher content of T phase. As presented in , based on R-T multiphase coexistence, the refined fitting of diffraction {110} peaks show that the NaNbO3-like and KNbO3-like heterogeneity grains have almost disappeared in final two-step sintering, indicating chemical homogeneity is basically realized in final high temperature sintering process. On one hand, it is reported that both K-rich and Na-rich KNN grains can grow rapidly and their diffusion mechanisms are activated when the calcination temperature is over 1000 \xb0C. Therefore, K-rich and Na-rich KNN can inter-diffuse and KNN matrix with a K/Na ratio of approximately 1:1 is expected. On the other hand, if an effective homogenization is obtained in KNN-based ceramics on the basis of multi-ferroelectric phase coexistence during the final sintering process, the preferable piezoelectric properties will be mostly expected (discussed in the following text). To further determine the composition homogeneity of bulk ceramics under different preparation processes, EDS spectra near both larger and smaller grains of bulk ceramics are presented in. Compared with composition heterogeneity in calcined powders , the K/Na ratio is approximately 1:1 in bulk ceramics under final high temperature sintering, indicating high efficiency homogenization of KNN-based ceramics under elevated temperature (>1100 \xb0C). However, although no obvious enrichment of NaNbO3-like and KNbO3-like heterogeneity grains is observed in {100} re\ufb02ection peaks , owing to limitations in measurement precision of XRD, slight A-site inhomogeneity are observed in EDS spectra of bulk ceramics without twice ball milling ((a and b)). On the other hand, previous researches have concluded that the chemical heterogeneity of KNN can be homogenized by repeated calcination , but since there is a significant compositional difference between K-rich and Na-rich KNN in pre-calcinated powders, the homogenization of these particles can still occur but with a limited efficiency in elevated sintering temperature, which consequently induces KNN-based bulk ceramics with a slight fluctuation K/Na ratio distribution. Both K-rich and Na-rich types of KNN grains can grow rapidly and diffuse to each other at final sintering process owing to that the mass diffusion is activated , and thus, compared with bimodal-like un-uniform particle size distribution in calcined powders , almost unimodal-like grain size distributions are observed in bulk ceramics. Besides, photos of CZ samples under different preparation processes show slight color differences , yet all have high densification (>95 %) under different sintering conditions. To quantitative evaluate the uniformity of grain distribution, standard deviation (\u03c3) based on statistical analysis of grain size distribution in buck ceramics after final sintering is exhibited in. Particularly, compared with ceramics in group A ((a\u2013d)), the abnormal grain growth behavior in bulk ceramics is greatly suppressed after twice ball milling in group B ((e\u2013h)), associated with gradually decrease in AGS  and significant reduction in \u03c3 of grain size , indicating more uniform grain size distribution is realized in group B. According to research by Malic et al., Na2CO3 decomposes and reacts with B-site oxide (e.g., Nb2O5, ZrO2) more easily than K2CO3, and possesses a higher diffusion reactivity rate, inducing abnormal heterogeneous grain growth in final sintering process. Thus, owing to more serious chemical heterogeneity of calcined powders in group A, heterogeneous KNN can form recrystallized seeds in the first stage, and sustainable growth in the second stage during TSS, followed by the homogenization process. Consequently, an amount of abnormal coarse grains (\u223c10\u201314 \u03bcm) is observed in 800-1st and 850-1st ((a and b)), and this phenomenon has been alleviated with the appropriate improvement of chemical homogeneity by enhancing calcination temperature and twice ball-milling. Additionally, one can see that appropriate sintering temperature can promote homogenization, and increase AGS, while the maximum value of AGS in groups A&B can be obtained at 900-1st and 900-2nd, respectively, and the slightly increased grain size in each group could promote the domain switching, inducing the enhanced piezoelectric properties. We measured variations of d33 and kp of ceramics under different preparation processes ( ). Particularly, compared with ceramics in group A, d33 and kp are greatly improved after twice ball milling in group B, exhibiting a trend akin to the changes of standard deviation analysis of grain size distribution in bulk ceramics. Meanwhile, the \u03b8max in frequency-dependent impedance spectra represents poling efficiency, while an ideal polarization effect can be realized when \u03b8 reaches nearly 90\xb0. Notably, the \u03b8max in group B significantly increases compared with ceramics in group A , indicating that more efficient domain switching and higher polarization efficiency are obtained in uniform grain size distribution. Besides, an interesting phenomenon is that ceramics with a calcination temperature of 900 \xb0C (i.e., 900-1st, 900-2nd) have achieved better piezoelectric properties in each group. Specifically, the maximum d33 value of 368 pC/N is obtained in the CZ-doped sample in group B, as well as an excellent kp value (kp = 0.52). To further elucidate the underlying mechanism of the enormous difference in piezoelectric properties within group A and group B, temperature-dependent permittivity curves and in-situ temperature-dependent d33 of CZ ceramics calcined at 900 \xb0C with better piezoelectric properties in each group are investigated. As shown in , in addition to the relatively sharp peak corresponding to Curie temperature (TC), only one weak diffused bump related to the complex ferroelectric phase boundaries is observed, which agrees well with the polymorphic phase structure of the KNN-BNZ system. Correspondingly, note that the small signal d33 variation with temperature determined by in situ d33 curves also follows a similar tendency, where d33 increases slowly and forms a weak diffused bump near ambient temperature , which is also related to the complex ferroelectric phase transition. Besides, TC is also dependent on grain uniformity and chemical homogeneity, and it will slightly fluctuate among different preparation processes. Meanwhile, d33 of ceramics in each group decreases continuously with increasing temperature, gradually reaching 0 pC/N slightly below TC, and exhibit similar in situ depolarization behaviors. As presented in , the ferroelectric hysteresis loops become more saturated in group B, following with a slight enhancement of remanent polarization (Pr), indicating that the significant enhancement of the switching ability of the non-180\xb0 ferroelectric domain during polarization. Meanwhile, the maximum polarization (Pmax), bipolar and unipolar electrostrains (S), and switching current (I) also increase in group B, indicating an obvious synchronous enhancement of both intrinsic piezoelectric response and extrinsic domain switching during polarization, which is consistent with the variation trend of \u03b8max in frequency-dependent impedance spectra. The aforementioned results demonstrate that chemical inhomogeneity is extensively present in the calcined KNN-based powders, which is believed to be an origin of the distinct grain growth behavior and different piezoelectric properties in group A and group B under the same final TSS process. Besides, chemical modification, especially multicomponent co-doping strategy, has been the most important strategy for enhancing the piezoelectric properties of KNN-based ceramic. Additionally, multiple dopants (or modifiers) would be added to the KNN systems simultaneously, which inevitably induces the chemical reaction among reactants becoming highly competitive. The 900-2nd KNN powders with better chemical homogeneity and KNbO3 powders, were pressed by cold isostatic pressure to form green discs, respectively. Then, they were pressed into a laminated structure with 10 mm in according to the mass ratio of 1:1, and sintered using TSS technique under the same sintering conditions. XRD profiles indicate that perovskite structure has been synthesized in both KNN-based and KNbO3 ceramics after the final TSS sintering. It can be seen from that KNN (900-2nd) and KNbO3 can be well combined after final sintering, and a clear mesoscopic interface is observed between them. Notably, an interesting phenomenon is that the Na-rich phase appears around interface of two systems and inside the region of KNbO3 bulk ceramic, while segregation of K is not observed on the side of KNN. Additionally, line scanning EDS spectra of laminated structure shows a significant difference in content of K between KNN (900-2nd) and KNbO3 on both sides of the interface, and Na content in KNbO3 region even increases as moving away from the interface. Therefore, different diffusion rates of A-site ions (KE^{+} or NaE^{+}) is one of the reasons for chemical inhomogeneity, inducing chemical competition in solid-state synthesis process being more extreme. Meanwhile, it has been extensively reported that Nb2O5/ZrO2 tend to react more easily with Na2CO3 than K2CO3, owing to Na2CO3 obtaining higher reactivity and diffusion coefficient. Therefore, NaNbO3-like grains can grow rapidly into an enormous size and consume most of the surface driving force in the calcination process. Consequently, the grain growth of KNbO3-like grains will be inhibited to a certain extent, inducing diffusion kinetics to be unbalanced in calcination process, which will affect the non-uniform grain growth behavior and homogenization efficiency in the final sintering process. As presented in (a), twice ball-milling is beneficial to reduce grain size differences and obtain more homogeneous calcined powders, inducing diffusion kinetics of NaNbO3-like and KNbO3-like particles reaches consistent. Thus, it will promote uniformity of mixing and chemically homogenous of the green powder , which accelerates heterogeneous particles with smaller grain size difference easily to form recrystallized seeds in the first stage of TSS. In the second stage, the ceramics are rapidly cooled to a lower temperature, promoting the mutual diffusion of grain boundaries easily under the effect of capillary forces, inducing uniform grain growth behavior, and inducing the K/Na ratio in final KNN products close to 1 , which facilitates homogenization process in final sintering process. Consequently, the uniform grain size distribution and preferable chemical homogeneity can be obtained by regulating processing parameters (i.e., systematical modulate the calcination temperature and subsequent ball milling treatment) in synthesis process of multicomponent co-doping KNN systems.

# TITLE
The impact of chemical inhomogeneity in calcinated powders on grain growth behavior and piezoelectric properties of lead-free KNN-based ceramic

# ABSTRACT
Despite outstanding electromechanical properties are achieved in KNN-based ceramics, unstable reproducibility of piezoelectric properties remains a challenge to industrial production, owing to a lack of in-depth understanding of grain growth behavior and chemical homogenization throughout the overall solid-state synthesis process. Herein, a significant chemical heterogeneity behavior was found in calcined 0.957K0.48Na0.52Nb0.96Sb0.04O3-0.04Bi0.5Na0.5ZrO3-0.003CaZrO3 powders owing to non-uniform diffusion and competitive chemical reaction among multicomponent reactants. Finally, we obtained uniform grain size distribution and preferable chemical homogeneity in ceramics with the calcination of 900Â Â°C and undergone twice ball milling, which exhibited superior piezoelectric properties (d33Â =Â 368Â pC/N, kpÂ =Â 0.52). This work provides an effective paradigm to ameliorate the inferior reproducibility of KNN-based ceramics by effectively regulating the processing condition during solid-state synthesis.

# INTRODUCTION
Potassium sodium niobate (K0.5Na0.5NbO3, abbreviated as KNN) based ceramics have attracted considerable attention due to their advantage of high piezoelectric activity, Curie temperature (TC) and environment-friendly. Over the past decades, the construction of polymorphic phase boundary (PPB) around room temperature has become one of the most promising approaches for improving the piezoelectric coefficient (d33) of KNN-based ceramics (e.g., co-doping Bi0.5Na0.5ZrO3). It was reported that the phase structure and particle size of Nb2O5 precursor may affect the chemical heterogeneity of KNN powder during solid-state synthesis, which probably influences the reproducibility of piezoelectric properties. However, in addition to the Nb2O5 precursor, poor reproducibility may also originate from the sensitivity to processing conditions , volatilization of alkaline elements in A-site , complicated grain growth behavior , and chemical heterogeneity , inducing an impenetrable barrier for further development of industrial production. Among various issues, the underlying mechanism of high piezoelectric properties and the relationship between grain growth behavior and chemical inhomogeneous structure so far remains a controversial puzzle in piezoceramics , and few research has explored the grain size effect and chemical inhomogeneous between green powders to ceramic blocks in KNN-based systems. Additionally, since there is a narrow sintering temperature interval for KNN-based ceramics, it is difficult to control grain size and improve microstructure to prepare highly dense alternatives in normal sintering. Zhang et al. have revealed that two-step sintering (TSS) is considered as an effective technique to modulate grain growth behavior by exploiting the difference in kinetics between grain-boundary diffusion and grain-boundary migration in two different stages, which may be beneficial to modify the reproducibility of KNN-based ceramics. Besides, the diffusion kinetics in sintering process is considered as the most important factor of chemical homogenization, which is dependent on the chemical nature of the reactants (e.g., NaNbO3 and KNbO3), grain size and distribution, uniformity of mixing as well as the preparation processes such as calcination temperature, dwelling time, mixing technique, etc. To decipher the interaction mechanism of grain growth behavior, chemical inhomogeneity, and piezoelectricity, 0.957K0.48Na0.52Nb0.96Sb0.04O3-0.04Bi0.5Na0.5ZrO3-0.003CaZrO3 are prepared using two-step sintering via conventional solid-state method. Additionally, homogenization and uniform grain size distribution were achieved by calcinating raw materials at different temperatures (800, 850, 900, and 950 \xb0C) and subsequent ball milling treatment.

# CONCLUSION
In this study, we synergistically modulate calcination temperatures and ball-milling technique to investigate the relationship among grain growth behavior and chemical homogenization from the calcination process to final TSS sintering. Importantly, it is indicated that the grain growth kinetic of the heterogeneous calcined powder with different particle sizes plays a significant role in size-dependent grain growth behavior and chemical homogenization of bulk ceramics during finally TSS, inducing significant difference of piezo-/ferroelectric properties. Meanwhile, we achieve a uniform grain size distribution (\u03c3 < 1) with preferable chemical homogeneity in 900-2nd ceramics, which exhibits superior piezoelectric properties (d33 = 368 pC/N, kp = 0.52). It is suggested that synergistically modulating chemical homogeneity and grain distribution in calcined powders, which is the critical factor of poor reproducibility of properties of KNN-based solid solutions, should paid much attention to significantly enhance the manufacturability in industrial production.

To further determine the composition homogeneity of bulk ceramics under different preparation processes, EDS spectra near both larger and smaller grains of bulk ceramics are presented in. Compared with composition heterogeneity in calcined powders , the K/Na ratio is approximately 1:1 in bulk ceramics under final high temperature sintering, indicating high efficiency homogenization of KNN-based ceramics under elevated temperature (>1100 \xb0C). However, although no obvious enrichment of NaNbO3-like and KNbO3-like heterogeneity grains is observed in {100} re\ufb02ection peaks , owing to limitations in measurement precision of XRD, slight A-site inhomogeneity are observed in EDS spectra of bulk ceramics without twice ball milling ((a and b)). On the other hand, previous researches have concluded that the chemical heterogeneity of KNN can be homogenized by repeated calcination , but since there is a significant compositional difference between K-rich and Na-rich KNN in pre-calcinated powders, the homogenization of these particles can still occur but with a limited efficiency in elevated sintering temperature, which consequently induces KNN-based bulk ceramics with a slight fluctuation K/Na ratio distribution. Both K-rich and Na-rich types of KNN grains can grow rapidly and diffuse to each other at final sintering process owing to that the mass diffusion is activated , and thus, compared with bimodal-like un-uniform particle size distribution in calcined powders , almost unimodal-like grain size distributions are observed in bulk ceramics. Besides, photos of CZ samples under different preparation processes show slight color differences , yet all have high densification (>95 %) under different sintering conditions. To quantitative evaluate the uniformity of grain distribution, standard deviation (\u03c3) based on statistical analysis of grain size distribution in buck ceramics after final sintering is exhibited in. Particularly, compared with ceramics in group A ((a\u2013d)), the abnormal grain growth behavior in bulk ceramics is greatly suppressed after twice ball milling in group B ((e\u2013h)), associated with gradually decrease in AGS  and significant reduction in \u03c3 of grain size , indicating more uniform grain size distribution is realized in group B. According to research by Malic et al., Na2CO3 decomposes and reacts with B-site oxide (e.g., Nb2O5, ZrO2) more easily than K2CO3, and possesses a higher diffusion reactivity rate, inducing abnormal heterogeneous grain growth in final sintering process. Thus, owing to more serious chemical heterogeneity of calcined powders in group A, heterogeneous KNN can form recrystallized seeds in the first stage, and sustainable growth in the second stage during TSS, followed by the homogenization process. Consequently, an amount of abnormal coarse grains (\u223c10\u201314 \u03bcm) is observed in 800-1st and 850-1st ((a and b)), and this phenomenon has been alleviated with the appropriate improvement of chemical homogeneity by enhancing calcination temperature and twice ball-milling. Additionally, one can see that appropriate sintering temperature can promote homogenization, and increase AGS, while the maximum value of AGS in groups A&B can be obtained at 900-1st and 900-2nd, respectively, and the slightly increased grain size in each group could promote the domain switching, inducing the enhanced piezoelectric properties. We measured variations of d33 and kp of ceramics under different preparation processes ( ). Particularly, compared with ceramics in group A, d33 and kp are greatly improved after twice ball milling in group B, exhibiting a trend akin to the changes of standard deviation analysis of grain size distribution in bulk ceramics. Meanwhile, the \u03b8max in frequency-dependent impedance spectra represents poling efficiency, while an ideal polarization effect can be realized when \u03b8 reaches nearly 90\xb0. Notably, the \u03b8max in group B significantly increases compared with ceramics in group A , indicating that more efficient domain switching and higher polarization efficiency are obtained in uniform grain size distribution. Besides, an interesting phenomenon is that ceramics with a calcination temperature of 900 \xb0C (i.e., 900-1st, 900-2nd) have achieved better piezoelectric properties in each group. Specifically, the maximum d33 value of 368 pC/N is obtained in the CZ-doped sample in group B, as well as an excellent kp value (kp = 0.52). To further elucidate the underlying mechanism of the enormous difference in piezoelectric properties within group A and group B, temperature-dependent permittivity curves and in-situ temperature-dependent d33 of CZ ceramics calcined at 900 \xb0C with better piezoelectric properties in each group are investigated. As shown in , in addition to the relatively sharp peak corresponding to Curie temperature (TC), only one weak diffused bump related to the complex ferroelectric phase boundaries is observed, which agrees well with the polymorphic phase structure of the KNN-BNZ system. Correspondingly, note that the small signal d33 variation with temperature determined by in situ d33 curves also follows a similar tendency, where d33 increases slowly and forms a weak diffused bump near ambient temperature , which is also related to the complex ferroelectric phase transition. Besides, TC is also dependent on grain uniformity and chemical homogeneity, and it will slightly fluctuate among different preparation processes. Meanwhile, d33 of ceramics in each group decreases continuously with increasing temperature, gradually reaching 0 pC/N slightly below TC, and exhibit similar in situ depolarization behaviors. As presented in , the ferroelectric hysteresis loops become more saturated in group B, following with a slight enhancement of remanent polarization (Pr), indicating that the significant enhancement of the switching ability of the non-180\xb0 ferroelectric domain during polarization. Meanwhile, the maximum polarization (Pmax), bipolar and unipolar electrostrains (S), and switching current (I) also increase in group B, indicating an obvious synchronous enhancement of both intrinsic piezoelectric response and extrinsic domain switching during polarization, which is consistent with the variation trend of \u03b8max in frequency-dependent impedance spectra. The aforementioned results demonstrate that chemical inhomogeneity is extensively present in the calcined KNN-based powders, which is believed to be an origin of the distinct grain growth behavior and different piezoelectric properties in group A and group B under the same final TSS process. Besides, chemical modification, especially multicomponent co-doping strategy, has been the most important strategy for enhancing the piezoelectric properties of KNN-based ceramic. Additionally, multiple dopants (or modifiers) would be added to the KNN systems simultaneously, which inevitably induces the chemical reaction among reactants becoming highly competitive. The 900-2nd KNN powders with better chemical homogeneity and KNbO3 powders, were pressed by cold isostatic pressure to form green discs, respectively. Then, they were pressed into a laminated structure with 10 mm in according to the mass ratio of 1:1, and sintered using TSS technique under the same sintering conditions. XRD profiles indicate that perovskite structure has been synthesized in both KNN-based and KNbO3 ceramics after the final TSS sintering. It can be seen from that KNN (900-2nd) and KNbO3 can be well combined after final sintering, and a clear mesoscopic interface is observed between them. Notably, an interesting phenomenon is that the Na-rich phase appears around interface of two systems and inside the region of KNbO3 bulk ceramic, while segregation of K is not observed on the side of KNN. Additionally, line scanning EDS spectra of laminated structure shows a significant difference in content of K between KNN (900-2nd) and KNbO3 on both sides of the interface, and Na content in KNbO3 region even increases as moving away from the interface. Therefore, different diffusion rates of A-site ions (KE^{+} or NaE^{+}) is one of the reasons for chemical inhomogeneity, inducing chemical competition in solid-state synthesis process being more extreme. Meanwhile, it has been extensively reported that Nb2O5/ZrO2 tend to react more easily with Na2CO3 than K2CO3, owing to Na2CO3 obtaining higher reactivity and diffusion coefficient. Therefore, NaNbO3-like grains can grow rapidly into an enormous size and consume most of the surface driving force in the calcination process. Consequently, the grain growth of KNbO3-like grains will be inhibited to a certain extent, inducing diffusion kinetics to be unbalanced in calcination process, which will affect the non-uniform grain growth behavior and homogenization efficiency in the final sintering process. As presented in (a), twice ball-milling is beneficial to reduce grain size differences and obtain more homogeneous calcined powders, inducing diffusion kinetics of NaNbO3-like and KNbO3-like particles reaches consistent. Thus, it will promote uniformity of mixing and chemically homogenous of the green powder , which accelerates heterogeneous particles with smaller grain size difference easily to form recrystallized seeds in the first stage of TSS. In the second stage, the ceramics are rapidly cooled to a lower temperature, promoting the mutual diffusion of grain boundaries easily under the effect of capillary forces, inducing uniform grain growth behavior, and inducing the K/Na ratio in final KNN products close to 1 , which facilitates homogenization process in final sintering process. Consequently, the uniform grain size distribution and preferable chemical homogeneity can be obtained by regulating processing parameters (i.e., systematical modulate the calcination temperature and subsequent ball milling treatment) in synthesis process of multicomponent co-doping KNN systems.

# TITLE
The impact of chemical inhomogeneity in calcinated powders on grain growth behavior and piezoelectric properties of lead-free KNN-based ceramic

# ABSTRACT
Despite outstanding electromechanical properties are achieved in KNN-based ceramics, unstable reproducibility of piezoelectric properties remains a challenge to industrial production, owing to a lack of in-depth understanding of grain growth behavior and chemical homogenization throughout the overall solid-state synthesis process. Herein, a significant chemical heterogeneity behavior was found in calcined 0.957K0.48Na0.52Nb0.96Sb0.04O3-0.04Bi0.5Na0.5ZrO3-0.003CaZrO3 powders owing to non-uniform diffusion and competitive chemical reaction among multicomponent reactants. Finally, we obtained uniform grain size distribution and preferable chemical homogeneity in ceramics with the calcination of 900Â Â°C and undergone twice ball milling, which exhibited superior piezoelectric properties (d33Â =Â 368Â pC/N, kpÂ =Â 0.52). This work provides an effective paradigm to ameliorate the inferior reproducibility of KNN-based ceramics by effectively regulating the processing condition during solid-state synthesis.

# INTRODUCTION
Potassium sodium niobate (K0.5Na0.5NbO3, abbreviated as KNN) based ceramics have attracted considerable attention due to their advantage of high piezoelectric activity, Curie temperature (TC) and environment-friendly. Over the past decades, the construction of polymorphic phase boundary (PPB) around room temperature has become one of the most promising approaches for improving the piezoelectric coefficient (d33) of KNN-based ceramics (e.g., co-doping Bi0.5Na0.5ZrO3). It was reported that the phase structure and particle size of Nb2O5 precursor may affect the chemical heterogeneity of KNN powder during solid-state synthesis, which probably influences the reproducibility of piezoelectric properties. However, in addition to the Nb2O5 precursor, poor reproducibility may also originate from the sensitivity to processing conditions , volatilization of alkaline elements in A-site , complicated grain growth behavior , and chemical heterogeneity , inducing an impenetrable barrier for further development of industrial production. Among various issues, the underlying mechanism of high piezoelectric properties and the relationship between grain growth behavior and chemical inhomogeneous structure so far remains a controversial puzzle in piezoceramics , and few research has explored the grain size effect and chemical inhomogeneous between green powders to ceramic blocks in KNN-based systems. Additionally, since there is a narrow sintering temperature interval for KNN-based ceramics, it is difficult to control grain size and improve microstructure to prepare highly dense alternatives in normal sintering. Zhang et al. have revealed that two-step sintering (TSS) is considered as an effective technique to modulate grain growth behavior by exploiting the difference in kinetics between grain-boundary diffusion and grain-boundary migration in two different stages, which may be beneficial to modify the reproducibility of KNN-based ceramics. Besides, the diffusion kinetics in sintering process is considered as the most important factor of chemical homogenization, which is dependent on the chemical nature of the reactants (e.g., NaNbO3 and KNbO3), grain size and distribution, uniformity of mixing as well as the preparation processes such as calcination temperature, dwelling time, mixing technique, etc. To decipher the interaction mechanism of grain growth behavior, chemical inhomogeneity, and piezoelectricity, 0.957K0.48Na0.52Nb0.96Sb0.04O3-0.04Bi0.5Na0.5ZrO3-0.003CaZrO3 are prepared using two-step sintering via conventional solid-state method. Additionally, homogenization and uniform grain size distribution were achieved by calcinating raw materials at different temperatures (800, 850, 900, and 950 \xb0C) and subsequent ball milling treatment.

# CONCLUSION
In this study, we synergistically modulate calcination temperatures and ball-milling technique to investigate the relationship among grain growth behavior and chemical homogenization from the calcination process to final TSS sintering. Importantly, it is indicated that the grain growth kinetic of the heterogeneous calcined powder with different particle sizes plays a significant role in size-dependent grain growth behavior and chemical homogenization of bulk ceramics during finally TSS, inducing significant difference of piezo-/ferroelectric properties. Meanwhile, we achieve a uniform grain size distribution (\u03c3 < 1) with preferable chemical homogeneity in 900-2nd ceramics, which exhibits superior piezoelectric properties (d33 = 368 pC/N, kp = 0.52). It is suggested that synergistically modulating chemical homogeneity and grain distribution in calcined powders, which is the critical factor of poor reproducibility of properties of KNN-based solid solutions, should paid much attention to significantly enhance the manufacturability in industrial production.

", agent="Material Composition and Property Extractor", status="completed", output="I need to extract the material compositions, their corresponding d33 values, the unit for d33, and the material family from the provided text. I also need to identify any abbreviations for the compositions.

Here's my plan:
1.  **Scan the text for d33 values and associated compositions.** The abstract and conclusion sections often contain the most direct statements about the best properties and their corresponding compositions.
2.  **Identify the full chemical formula** for the compositions mentioned.
3.  **Note the d33 value and its unit.**
4.  **Determine the material family.** The introduction and title usually provide this.
5.  **Check for abbreviations** and create the `abbreviations` key if found.

From the abstract and conclusion, I found:

*   d33 value: `368`
*   Unit: `pC/N`
*   Family: `KNN-based` (from title and introduction, specifically "Potassium sodium niobate (K0.5Na0.5NbO3, abbreviated as KNN) based ceramics")
*   Abbreviation: `KNN` for `K0.5Na0.5NbO3`. Also `NN` for `NaNbO3` and `KN` for `KNbO3` are mentioned in the results section. The main composition is `KNN-based`, so `KNN` is the most relevant abbreviation for the family. The full composition `0.957K0.48Na0.52Nb0.96Sb0.04O3-0.04Bi0.5Na0.5ZrO3-0.003CaZrO3` is not abbreviated.

Let's refine the abbreviations. The text mentions:
*   "Potassium sodium niobate (K0.5Na0.5NbO3, abbreviated as KNN)" -> `KNN`: `K0.5Na0.5NbO3`
*   "NaNbO3 (NN)" -> `NN`: `NaNbO3`
*   "KNbO3 (KN)" -> `KN`: `KNbO3`

The main composition for which d33 is reported is `0.957K0.48Na0.52Nb0.96Sb0.04O3-0.04Bi0.5Na0.5ZrO3-0.003CaZrO3`. This is a KNN-based ceramic.

The family is clearly "KNN-based".

The d33 value is 368 pC/N for the specific composition `0.957K0.48Na0.52Nb0.96Sb0.04O3-0.04Bi0.5Na0.5ZrO3-0.003CaZrO3`.
