If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'Solid State Reaction', 'precursors': ['PbO', 'BaCO3', 'Nb2O5', 'Nd2O3', 'Methanol', 'PVA'], 'steps': ['Weighed and mixed raw powdered materials (PbO, BaCO3, Nb2O5, and Nd2O3) in stoichiometric ratio.', 'Balanced lead loss during heat treatment at 1250 °C for 2 h with 6 wt% of PbO in each composition.', 'Added methanol as a dispersing agent and left for 1 h for uniform mixing.', 'Added PVA (5 wt%) as a binder with a PVA-to-ceramic powder weight ratio of 1:20.', 'Pressed powder into pellets using a uniaxial hydraulic press at 150 MPa for 3 min.', 'Sintered in an air atmosphere at 1150 °C for 4 h.', 'Heated the pellet as an electrode at 600 °C for half an hour after coating with gold and applying silver paints.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['Powder-XRD', 'SEM', 'Optical Microscope', 'LF impedance analyser', "Archimedes' principle", 'EDS']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
