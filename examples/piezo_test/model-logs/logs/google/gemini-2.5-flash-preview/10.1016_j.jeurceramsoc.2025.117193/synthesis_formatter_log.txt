", agent="Synthesis Data Formatter", status="completed", output="I need to format the provided synthesis data.
I will keep 'method' and 'characterization_techniques' as they are, since no allowed entities were provided for them.
I will keep 'precursors' and 'steps' as they are, as per the instructions.

Therefore, the output will be the input dictionary itself, with no modifications.```json
