Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'sol–gel', 'precursors': ['Ba(CH3COO)2', 'Ca(NO3)2·4H2O', 'Zr(NO3)4·5H2O', 'Ti(OC4H9)4', 'La(NO3)3·nH2O'], 'steps': ['The solution was placed in the oven at 120 °C for 10 h to obtain gels.', 'The gels were calcined at 900 °C for 2 h to form precursor powders.', 'The powders were pressed into disks with a diameter of 20 mm and the disks were embedded in alumina.', 'The disks were sintered at 1300 °C for 4 h in air with a heating rate of 5 °C/min.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['X-ray diffraction (XRD)', 'scanning electron microscopy (SEM)', 'Vickers hardness tester', 'X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)', 'dielectric testing instrument', 'LCR instrument', 'radiant precision workstation', 'quasistatic piezoelectric meter', 'electron density balance']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
