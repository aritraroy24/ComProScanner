Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same.

**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'solid-state reaction', 'precursors': ['Ca2CO3', 'Li2CO3', 'CeO2', 'Bi2O3', 'Nb2O5'], 'steps': ['Constituents were meticulously weighed according to stoichiometric ratios.', 'Subjected to a thorough ball-milling process for 24 h.', 'Milled powders were calcined at 850 °C for 3 h.', 'Calcined powders were granulated and pressed into disks (8.5 mm diameter, 2 mm thickness).', 'Green compacts were sintered within a sealed crucible at 1120 °C for 4 h.', 'Samples were poled under a DC field of 15 kV/mm in silicone oil at 160 °C for about 30 min.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'SEM', 'ferroelectric analyzer', 'quasi-static d33 meter', 'in situ temperature-dependent d33 measurement', 'Raman spectroscopy', 'precision impedance analyzer', 'piezoresponse force microscope', 'EDS']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
