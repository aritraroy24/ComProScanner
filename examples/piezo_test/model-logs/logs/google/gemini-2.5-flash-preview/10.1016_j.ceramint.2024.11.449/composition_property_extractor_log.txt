# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a) shows the XRD patterns of (NaCe) and (WMn) modified CBN ceramics powders. A single orthorhombic phase (PDF#49\u20130608) without any impurities is detected, suggesting that doping ions have been incorporated into the host lattice of CBN ceramics and formed a solid solution. The (115) peak shows the highest intensity, which is consistent with the most intense reflection of (112m + 1) in BLSFs. To further analyze the effect of co-doping on the crystal structure, Rietveld refinement of powder XRD data were studied for all samples through the Jade program using the orthorhombic space group A21am. As exhibited in (b) and (c), the lattice parameters refined a, b, c and the cell volume all exhibit a gradual decline followed by an increase with the increasing content of doping ions, reaching the minimum value at x = 0.03. In order to investigate the effect of dopant on the lattice symmetry of CBN-based ceramics, a new variable a/b is introduced and its value is presented in (c). This value initially decreases and subsequently increases with the increment of x, approaching a value of one at x = 0.03. The Raman curves exhibit a comparable profile for all content doped samples within the wave number range of 100\u20131000 cmE^{\u22121}, which may be related to the orthorhombic phase. The Raman spectra of CBN-based ceramics generally have two phonon vibrational modes: a high-frequency vibrational peak above 200 cmE^{\u22121} related to the [NbO6] oxygen octahedron, and a low-frequency portion below 200 cmE^{\u22121} associated with the vibration of the A-site cation. Here, four relatively strong (v 1-v 4) major phonon vibrational modes in the Raman spectrum were selected for further study , as shown in (e)\u2013(f). With the addition of dopant ions, v 1 is shifted to lower wave numbers than pure CBN, indicating that the A-site doping affects the vibration of CaE^{2+}, but there is no further effect as the doping content increases. v 2 is related to the lattice distortion of NbO6 , and the wave number of v 2 firstly decreases and then increases as the doping content increases when x \u2265 0.02, suggesting that lattice distortions are generated in the ceramic. The change in v 3 indicates that the dopant ions change the degree of tilt of the [NbO6] octahedron, while distortion occurs between the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layer and the perovskite-like CaNbO3 layer. The wave number of v 4 decreases and then increases with increasing doping content and reaches a minimum at x = 0.03, indicating that the asymmetric stretching and bending vibrations of Nb-O bond are most altered. (a)\u2013(e) illustrate the surface morphology of all component ceramics. The pure CBN ceramic exhibits a characteristic plate-like morphology, which is a distinctive feature commonly associated with BLFS. Ce doping effectively reduces the diffusion of ions along the a-b plane during sintering, thus inhibiting the growth of plate-like grains, and gradually forming the equiaxial morphology , as shown in (b)\u2013(e). (f) demonstrates the average grain size (length) and relative density of ceramics for all doping contents. Meanwhile, the average grain size (length) decreased dramatically from 12.7 \u03bcm to 4.14\u20134.57 \u03bcm with increasing substitution ion concentration. Furthermore, in CaBi2Nb2O9-based ceramics, a smaller grain size typically enhances the piezoelectric response. Optimized piezoelectric response is expected to be obtained in CBNCWM-0.03 ceramics. (a) demonstrates the piezoelectric coefficients of CBNCWM-x ceramics with different doping contents. d 33 reaches a maximum value of 17.2 pC/N at x = 0.03, which is far more than pure CBN with 5.5 pC/N. (b) exhibits the thermal depoling progress of all compositions by measuring the d 33 of ceramics at room temperature, following an annealing process at the specific depoling temperatures for 2 h. As the annealing temperature approaches T C, the d 33 values of all ceramics are decreased dramatically due to the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition. It was observed that d 33 of CBNCWM-0.03 ceramics only decreased by 9.3 % at 900 \xb0C, showing excellent high-temperature stability. To better understand the internal mechanism, the PFM images of pure CBN and CBNCWM-0.03 ceramics are depicted in (c)\u2013(f). Compared to pure CBN with a rod-like domain structure, the doped ceramic exhibits a submicron domain pattern, which is more uniform distribution within the selected area. Meanwhile, the vertical amplitude of CBNCWM-0.03 ceramic is larger than that of pure CBN in the same excitation voltage (7 V). The smaller domain size and more domains leads to an increase in the domain wall density, which contributes to the improvement of the piezoelectric response. (a) and (b) show the variation of dielectric constant (\u025b r ) and dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) at 1 MHz for all CBNCWM-x ceramics with temperature. In the range of 0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.03, T C exhibits an initial reduction from 925 \xb0C (pure CBN) to 913 \xb0C, followed by a gradual increase with subsequent increments in the dopant concentration x. This is similar to that change of structural distortion in the ceramics, which expresses as 2(a-b)/(a+b) , as shown in (c). In the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase, the [NbO6] oxygen octahedral distortion is caused by unequal Nb-O bond lengths. The symmetry of Nb-O bond decreases and then increases after the substitution of the dopant ions, as can be seen from the Raman spectrum v 4 above. From (b), it is seen that the (NaCe) and (WMn) substitution significantly reduces the tan\u03b4 in the high-temperature section (600\u2013800 \xb0C), which increases the dielectric stability of CBN ceramics and benefits to the application of in high-temperature fields. Resistivity represents a pivotal performance indicator for high-temperature piezoelectric materials, which has an important effect on the stability and reliability of high-temperature piezoelectric devices. (a) illustrates the temperature dependence of resistivity (\u03c1) for all compositions. The \u03c1 of the ceramic shows an exponential decrease with increasing temperature. This phenomenon can be attributed to the substantial activation of intrinsic carriers within the ceramic material as the temperature rises, thereby enhancing the high-temperature electrical conductivity of the ceramics. (c) shows that co-doping of (NaCe) and (WMn) significantly improves the resistivity of CBN ceramics under high temperatures, but the resistivity of the ceramic gradually decreases with further increase in doping amount when x > 0.02. In bismuth layered ceramics, oxygen vacancies (VO) and bismuth vacancies (VBi) are created due to the volatilisation of elemental bismuth during sintering. The replacement of low valence CaE^{2+} ions with high valence CeE^{4+} in the A-site, and NbE^{5+} replacement with WE^{6+} at the B-site could induce electron accumulation, generating charge compensation thereby reducing the hole carrier concentration and increasing the \u03c1 of ceramics. The donor doping process of Ce and W ions can be represented by the follow equations:  Meanwhile, the initial MnE^{2+} ionization will result in a further reduction in the VO \u2022\u2022 concentration, which is described as Mn +\u2192 Mn ++ e\u2032E^{2}E^{4}E^{2}. The coexistence of MnE^{2+} and MnE^{4+} can be corroborated by EPR results, as shown in (d). The EPR spectra displays the signals associated with multi-valent Mn ions (MnE^{2+}, MnE^{4+}) in the magnetic field between 310 and 360 mT. However, as the doping content is further increased, a high level of Ce and WMn introduce excess electrons, leading to higher carrier concentrations and paradoxically reducing the \u03c1 of ceramics. To further analyze the conductive mechanism of CBNCWM-x ceramics, it is possible to calculate the activation energy (E a ) of the DC resistivity by means of fitting the Arrhenius equation , where \u03c1 0, E a , kB, and T stand for the constant, activated energy, Boltzmann constant, and absolute temperature, respectively. Except for the pure CBN ceramics, the fitting results for all other compositions can be divided into two regions: the low-temperature section (LT, T < 300 \xb0C) and the high-temperature section (HT, T > 300 \xb0C). In the low-temperature region, the E a of the ceramics ranges from 0.86 eV to 1.06 eV, which is close to half of the secondary ionisation energy of the oxygen vacancies (1.4 eV), confirming that the main conductivity mechanism of the ceramics in the low-temperature region is the oxygen vacancy conductivity ; whereas the E a value locates in a rage of 1.59 eV\u20131.86 eV in the high-temperature region, which is close to half of the forbidden bandwidth of the oxygen octahedra (E g = 3.4 eV), indicating that the main conductivity mechanism is intrinsic conductivity. Compared with the pure CBN (E a \u223c1.7 eV), the introduction of doping ions leads to a shift from intrinsic to non-intrinsic conducting mechanisms in the ceramics. (a) shows that (NaCe) and (WMn) ions can effectively improve the piezoelectricity of CBN-based ceramics. Moreover, displays the d 33 and T C values of previously reported CBN-based ceramics.

# ABSTRACT
Calcium bismuth niobate CaBi2Nb2O9 (CBN)-based ceramics are promising candidates for high-temperature piezoelectric applications due to its high Curie temperature. Based on small sample datasets, a machine learning model was proposed to accelerate the design of CBN-based ceramics with high piezoelectricity and thermal stability. Using the trained gradient boosting regression model, the piezoelectric coefficients are predicted for CBN-based ceramics with different compositions. Based on the machine learning prediction results, we prepared the co-doped Ca1-2x

                     33 value after annealing at 900Â Â°C for 2Â h, demonstrating excellent thermal stability. The present work not only provides an approach for the rapid discovery of CBN-based ceramics with high piezoelectricity but also obtains excellent thermally stable ceramics for high-temperature applications.

# INTRODUCTION
The operating temperature in these fields typically exceeds 600 \xb0C and sometimes it reaches up to 1000 \xb0C. Since the commercial high-temperature piezoelectric single crystals such as YCa4O(BO3)3 (T C \u223c1500 \xb0C) and La2Ti2O7 (T C \u223c 1000 \xb0C) have a restricted range of applications due to the high manufacturing cost and complicated production process , the search for high-temperature piezoelectric ceramics with excellent piezoelectric performance, high operating temperature range and low cost has become an urgent need. Among different high-temperature piezoceramics, bismuth layered ferroelectric materials (BLSFs) have attracted significant research interest due to their special layered structures and high Curie temperatures (>500 \xb0C). In the family of BLSFs, CaBi2Nb2O9 (CBN) possesses an ultra-high Curie temperature (T C \u223c 940 \xb0C) and holds a promise for applications in extreme high-temperature environments. However, the piezoelectric constant of pure CBN is quite small and typically is 5 pC/N. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the piezoelectric response of CBN-based ceramics and maintain high T C to better satisfy device requirements. In general, both processing improvements and chemical doping can enhance the piezoelectric properties of CBN-based ceramics. For example, Yan et al. prepared CBN ceramics by discharge plasma sintering, the piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties showed obvious anisotropy and d 33 on the specific orientation was enhanced to 19 pC/N. Chen et al. prepared CBN textured ceramics by template grain growth method, the piezoelectricity coefficient reached 17.8 pC/N and the piezoelectricity performance was still stable at a high temperature of 800 \xb0C. The d 33 of CBN ceramics with A-site substitution by Ce/Gd/Tb was increased to 15.8/13/13.2 pC/N, while maintaining very high Curie temperature (928/947/966 \xb0C), respectively. On this basis, the piezoelectric coefficients of CBN-based ceramics obtained by mixed-valence doping with (NaCe) , (KCe) , and (LiCeY)  were increased to about 16 pC/N. In addition, B-site substitution CBN ceramics such as W , Mn , and (WCr)  also exhibited improved d 33 values to 14.4, 21.0, and 15.0 pC/N, respectively. Ce/LiCe and W ions co-doped CBN ceramics at A and B sites also increased d 33 to 13.4 and 16.1 pC/N. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a fast and convenient technique to accelerate the design of CBN-based ceramics with excellent piezoelectric properties. As more and more experimental data become available, the data-driven approach of machine learning (ML) has now made great progress in mining the relationship between the composition and properties of materials, such as finding compounds with high Curie temperatures in the BiMeO3-PbTiO3 system. ML is also widely used in predicting the piezoelectricity  and crystal structure of perovskite materials. Inspired by the above investigations, the present work proposes a machine learning model with small sample datasets to accelerate the design of CBN-based ceramics with high piezoelectricity and thermal stability. The piezoelectric coefficients are predicted for CBN-based ceramics with different compositions by using the gradient boosting regression model trained from the existing datasets. ML results show that compound Ca0.94(NaCe)0.03Bi2Nb1.97(W0.75Mn0.25)0.03O9 exhibits the optimum piezoelectric properties (\u223c15.5 pC/N). Assisted by the ML predictions, we prepared the co-doped Ca1-2x (NaCe) x Bi2Nb2-x (W0.75Mn0.25) x O9 (CBNCWM-x) by solid phase reaction method. The experimental piezoelectric coefficient of CBNCWM-0.03 is found to be 17.2 pC/N, indicating the reliability of the model. Meanwhile, the ceramics possess high T C values (\u223c913 \xb0C) and maintain 90.7 % of its original d 33 value after annealing at 900 \xb0C for 2 h, suggesting excellent thermal stability.

# CONCLUSION
In summary, we propose a machine learning model based on small sample datasets to accelerate the design of CBN-based ceramics with high piezoelectricity and thermal stability. The piezoelectric coefficients are predicted for CBN-based ceramics with different compositions. It is found that the new compound Ca0.94(NaCe)0.03Bi2Nb1.97(W0.75Mn0.25)0.03O9 exhibits the optimum piezoelectric coefficient among the calculated compositions. The d 33 of the experimental sample is consistent with ML predictions, confirming the reliability of the machine learning model. Meanwhile, the experimentally obtained piezoceramics not only possess outstanding piezoelectricity (d 33 \u223c 17.2 pC/N), but also achieve high Curie temperature (T C \u223c 913 \xb0C), excellent thermal stability (90.7 % of original d 33 after annealed at 900 \xb0C for 2 h) and high resistivity (1.25 \xd7 10E^{5} \u03a9 cm at 600 \xb0C). The present study suggests an effective way to rapidly design CBN-based ceramics with high piezoelectric properties and excellent thermal stability.

However, as the doping content is further increased, a high level of Ce and WMn introduce excess electrons, leading to higher carrier concentrations and paradoxically reducing the \u03c1 of ceramics. To further analyze the conductive mechanism of CBNCWM-x ceramics, it is possible to calculate the activation energy (E a ) of the DC resistivity by means of fitting the Arrhenius equation , where \u03c1 0, E a , kB, and T stand for the constant, activated energy, Boltzmann constant, and absolute temperature, respectively. Except for the pure CBN ceramics, the fitting results for all other compositions can be divided into two regions: the low-temperature section (LT, T < 300 \xb0C) and the high-temperature section (HT, T > 300 \xb0C). In the low-temperature region, the E a of the ceramics ranges from 0.86 eV to 1.06 eV, which is close to half of the secondary ionisation energy of the oxygen vacancies (1.4 eV), confirming that the main conductivity mechanism of the ceramics in the low-temperature region is the oxygen vacancy conductivity ; whereas the E a value locates in a rage of 1.59 eV\u20131.86 eV in the high-temperature region, which is close to half of the forbidden bandwidth of the oxygen octahedra (E g = 3.4 eV), indicating that the main conductivity mechanism is intrinsic conductivity. Compared with the pure CBN (E a \u223c1.7 eV), the introduction of doping ions leads to a shift from intrinsic to non-intrinsic conducting mechanisms in the ceramics. (a) shows that (NaCe) and (WMn) ions can effectively improve the piezoelectricity of CBN-based ceramics. Moreover, displays the d 33 and T C values of previously reported CBN-based ceramics.

# ABSTRACT
Calcium bismuth niobate CaBi2Nb2O9 (CBN)-based ceramics are promising candidates for high-temperature piezoelectric applications due to its high Curie temperature. Based on small sample datasets, a machine learning model was proposed to accelerate the design of CBN-based ceramics with high piezoelectricity and thermal stability. Using the trained gradient boosting regression model, the piezoelectric coefficients are predicted for CBN-based ceramics with different compositions. Based on the machine learning prediction results, we prepared the co-doped Ca1-2x

# INTRODUCTION
The operating temperature in these fields typically exceeds 600 \xb0C and sometimes it reaches up to 1000 \xb0C. Since the commercial high-temperature piezoelectric single crystals such as YCa4O(BO3)3 (T C \u223c1500 \xb0C) and La2Ti2O7 (T C \u223c 1000 \xb0C) have a restricted range of applications due to the high manufacturing cost and complicated production process , the search for high-temperature piezoelectric ceramics with excellent piezoelectric performance, high operating temperature range and low cost has become an urgent need. Among different high-temperature piezoceramics, bismuth layered ferroelectric materials (BLSFs) have attracted significant research interest due to their special layered structures and high Curie temperatures (>500 \xb0C). In the family of BLSFs, CaBi2Nb2O9 (CBN) possesses an ultra-high Curie temperature (T C \u223c 940 \xb0C) and holds a promise for applications in extreme high-temperature environments. However, the piezoelectric constant of pure CBN is quite small and typically is 5 pC/N. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the piezoelectric response of CBN-based ceramics and maintain high T C to better satisfy device requirements. In general, both processing improvements and chemical doping can enhance the piezoelectric properties of CBN-based ceramics. For example, Yan et al. prepared CBN ceramics by discharge plasma sintering, the piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties showed obvious anisotropy and d 33 on the specific orientation was enhanced to 19 pC/N. Chen et al. prepared CBN textured ceramics by template grain growth method, the piezoelectricity coefficient reached 17.8 pC/N and the piezoelectricity performance was still stable at a high temperature of 800 \xb0C. The d 33 of CBN ceramics with A-site substitution by Ce/Gd/Tb was increased to 15.8/13/13.2 pC/N, while maintaining very high Curie temperature (928/947/966 \xb0C), respectively. On this basis, the piezoelectric coefficients of CBN-based ceramics obtained by mixed-valence doping with (NaCe) , (KCe) , and (LiCeY)  were increased to about 16 pC/N. In addition, B-site substitution CBN ceramics such as W , Mn , and (WCr)  also exhibited improved d 33 values to 14.4, 21.0, and 15.0 pC/N, respectively. Ce/LiCe and W ions co-doped CBN ceramics at A and B sites also increased d 33 to 13.4 and 16.1 pC/N. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a fast and convenient technique to accelerate the design of CBN-based ceramics with excellent piezoelectric properties. As more and more experimental data become available, the data-driven approach of machine learning (ML) has now made great progress in mining the relationship between the composition and properties of materials, such as finding compounds with high Curie temperatures in the BiMeO3-PbTiO3 system. ML is also widely used in predicting the piezoelectricity  and crystal structure of perovskite materials. Inspired by the above investigations, the present work proposes a machine learning model with small sample datasets to accelerate the design of CBN-based ceramics with high piezoelectricity and thermal stability. The piezoelectric coefficients are predicted for CBN-based ceramics with different compositions by using the gradient boosting regression model trained from the existing datasets. ML results show that compound Ca0.94(NaCe)0.03Bi2Nb1.97(W0.75Mn0.25)0.03O9 exhibits the optimum piezoelectric properties (\u223c15.5 pC/N). Assisted by the ML predictions, we prepared the co-doped Ca1-2x (NaCe) x Bi2Nb2-x (W0.75Mn0.25) x O9 (CBNCWM-x) by solid phase reaction method. The experimental piezoelectric coefficient of CBNCWM-0.03 is found to be 17.2 pC/N, indicating the reliability of the model. Meanwhile, the ceramics possess high T C values (\u223c913 \xb0C) and maintain 90.7 % of its original d 33 value after annealing at 900 \xb0C for 2 h, suggesting excellent thermal stability.

# CONCLUSION
In summary, we propose a machine learning model based on small sample datasets to accelerate the design of CBN-based ceramics with high piezoelectricity and thermal stability. The piezoelectric coefficients are predicted for CBN-based ceramics with different compositions. It is found that the new compound Ca0.94(NaCe)0.03Bi2Nb1.97(W0.75Mn0.25)0.03O9 exhibits the optimum piezoelectric coefficient among the calculated compositions. The d 33 of the experimental sample is consistent with ML predictions, confirming the reliability of the machine learning model. Meanwhile, the experimentally obtained piezoceramics not only possess outstanding piezoelectricity (d 33 \u223c 17.2 pC/N), but also achieve high Curie temperature (T C \u223c 913 \xb0C), excellent thermal stability (90.7 % of original d 33 after annealed at 900 \xb0C for 2 h) and high resistivity (1.25 \xd7 10E^{5} \u03a9 cm at 600 \xb0C). The present study suggests an effective way to rapidly design CBN-based ceramics with high piezoelectric properties and excellent thermal stability.
