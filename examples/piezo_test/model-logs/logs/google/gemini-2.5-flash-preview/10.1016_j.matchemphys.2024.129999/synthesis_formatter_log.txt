Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'solvothermal approach', 'precursors': [], 'steps': ['Li-doped BaTiO3 ceramics were synthesized with varying weight percentages of Li (0 wt%, 2 wt%, and 4 wt%) using the solvothermal approach.', 'For dielectric measurements, the powders were pressed.', 'The pellets were sintered in a closed environment at 1100 °C for 2 h.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['Rietveld refinement', 'Transmission electron microscopy', 'SAED', 'dielectric impedance spectroscope']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
