**Description**: Format the extracted material composition and properties data. Focus on the 'Notes' if anything is provided. You MUST use 'MaterialParserTool' as tool if there is any variable in the composition in {'composition_extracted_data': {'compositions_property_values': {'(K0.50Na0.50)Eu0.01NbO3': 135}, 'abbreviations': {'KNEN': '(K0.50Na0.50)xEu0.01NbO3', 'KNN': '(K0.5Na0.5)NbO3'}, 'property_unit': 'pC/N', 'family': 'NaNbO3'}}. You MUST use the final output from the material parser tool as the final answer for such cases. Just resolve the variables - but don't do any final numerical calculation to get the composition percentage by yourself and keep the formula same as the original.
- If any abbreviated form of composition is present rewrite with the actual composition. But DON'T modify the chemical composition / periodic element with chemical name / element name for e.g., Bi should not be replaced with Bismuth or BaTiO3 should not be replaced with Barium titanate.
- If composition has variables with equation, after resolving the variable the formula should be written in a form of BODMAS rule with only () as brackets, + as addition, - as subtraction, * as multiplication and / as division. For e.g, ABx-2y/5C3 is a chemical formula, where A, B, C are periodic elements and x and y are variables with values x=2, y=3, the final chemical formula should be written as AB(2-((2*3)/5))O3 so that BODMAS rule can be applied later.

**Parameters**:
- Extracted composition-property dictionary-
{'composition_extracted_data': {'compositions_property_values': {'(K0.50Na0.50)Eu0.01NbO3': 135}, 'abbreviations': {'KNEN': '(K0.50Na0.50)xEu0.01NbO3', 'KNN': '(K0.5Na0.5)NbO3'}, 'property_unit': 'pC/N', 'family': 'NaNbO3'}}

The extracted output should look like the following-

{
  "compositions":
  {
    "Ba0.99Ca0.01Ti0.68Zr0.32O3": 375, 
    "Ba0.98Ca0.02Ti0.78Zr0.22O3": 350, 
    "Ba0.97Ca0.03Ti0.88Zr0.12O3": 325, 
    "Ba0.96Ca0.04Ti0.98Zr0.02O3": 300
  },
  "property_unit": "pC/N", 
  "family": "BaTiO3"
}

**Notes**:
- The unit, given here, along with other data, is just an example. It can change depending on the property.

", agent="Material Composition and Property Formatter", status="completed", output="Thought: The user wants to format the extracted material composition and properties data.
I need to check for variable substitutions in compositions and use the `Material Formula Parser` tool if necessary.
I also need to expand any abbreviated forms of compositions.
Finally, I need to remove duplicate entries if any.

Let's break down the input:
`'composition_extracted_data': {'compositions_property_values': {'(K0.50Na0.50)Eu0.01NbO3': 135}, 'abbreviations': {'KNEN': '(K0.50Na0.50)xEu0.01NbO3', 'KNN': '(K0.5Na0.5)NbO3'}, 'property_unit': 'pC/N', 'family': 'NaNbO3'}}`

1.  **`compositions_property_values`**: `'(K0.50Na0.50)Eu0.01NbO3': 135` - This composition does not have any variables.
2.  **`abbreviations`**:
    *   `'KNEN': '(K0.50Na0.50)xEu0.01NbO3'` - This has a variable 'x'. I need to check if 'x' is defined anywhere. It's not defined in the provided data. Since 'x' is not defined, I cannot resolve it using the tool. I will keep it as is, but it's an abbreviation, not a final composition for the `compositions_property_values`.
    *   `'KNN': '(K0.5Na0.5)NbO3'` - This does not have any variables. It's an abbreviation, not a final composition for the `compositions_property_values`.

The `compositions_property_values` only contains `'(K0.50Na0.50)Eu0.01NbO3': 135`. This composition does not have any variables to resolve.
The abbreviations are just definitions and are not part of the `compositions_property_values` that need to be formatted for the final output.

Therefore, I don't need to use the `Material Formula Parser` tool for the `compositions_property_values`.
The task also states: "If any abbreviated form of composition is present rewrite with the actual composition." However, the `compositions_property_values` already contains the full composition `(K0.50Na0.50)Eu0.01NbO3`. The abbreviations are separate definitions. The final output format only requires `compositions_property_values`, `property_unit`, and `family`.

So, the `compositions_property_values` will remain `'(K0.50Na0.50)Eu0.01NbO3': 135`.
The `property_unit` is `pC/N`.
The `family` is `NaNbO3`.
There are no duplicates to remove in the `compositions_property_values`.
There are no variables in the actual compositions that need to be resolved for the final output.
Therefore, no tool usage is required.
Final check on the output format:
```json
{
  "composition_formatted_data": {
  "compositions_property_values": Dict[str, Optional[Union[int, float]]],
  "property_unit": str,
  "family": str
}
}
```
This matches the required format.
Thought: I have analyzed the input data. The `compositions_property_values` dictionary contains `'(K0.50Na0.50)Eu0.01NbO3': 135`. This composition does not have any variables (like 'x' or 'y') that need to be resolved using the `Material Formula Parser` tool. The `abbreviations` section contains definitions, but these are not part of the `compositions_property_values` that need to be processed for the final output. Therefore, no tool usage is required. I will directly construct the final output based on the provided data.{
  "composition_formatted_data": {
    "compositions_property_values": {
      "(K0.50Na0.50)Eu0.01NbO3": 135
    },
    "property_unit": "pC/N",
    "family": "NaNbO3"
  }
}"
