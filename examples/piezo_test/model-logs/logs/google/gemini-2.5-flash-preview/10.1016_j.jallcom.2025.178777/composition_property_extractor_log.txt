# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
a shows the summarized XRD patterns of BCZT ceramics sintered at different temperatures from 1400 to 1500 \xb0C. According to the XRD patterns, all samples exhibit pure perovskite structures without any other heterogeneous peaks. It can be considered that CaE^{2+} has diffused to the A position of BaE^{2+}, ZrE^{4+} has diffused to the B position of TiE^{4+}, and CaE^{2+} and ZrE^{4+} have completely diffused into the BaTiO3 lattice to form a solid solution. The XRD patterns were profile-matched using Fullprof, refined using the Rietveld refinement method, and displayed in a\u2212e. The refined results show a good agreement between the measured XRD spectra and the fitted theoretical results. According to the lattice parameters obtained by refined results, the ceramics sintered from 1400 to 1500 \xb0C exhibit the coexistence of tetragonal (T) and orthorhombic (O) phases, which are very consistent with the P4mm and Amm2 models, respectively. The analyzed lattice parameters (i.e., a, b, c), refinement parameters (i.e., \uab53 E^{2}, R p, R wp , R exp ), and phase composition were summarized in. Then, the Debye-Scherrer formula was used to calculate the average size of particle size at different sintering temperatures, which could be expressed as follows , where k (k = 0.89) is the Scherrer constant, \u03b2 is the width at half maximum (FWHM) of the XRD peak, \u03b8 is the Bragg angle, \u03bb is the wavelength of X-ray (i.e, 1.5406 \xc5). For each sintering temperature, we have calculated the above parameters, i.e., 2\u03b8 (in degree), FWHM (in degree), \u03b2 (in rad), D (in nm), hkl, d hkl (in \xc5), and displayed in Tabs. S1-S5. Here, Bragg's law, i.e., 2 d hklsin\u03b8=n\u03bb, is employed to calculate d hkl with n being the diffraction order. The average particle sizes (D) calculated by the Debye-Scherrer formula are 28.24, 29.58, 29.85, 30.64, and 31.02 nm for the sintering temperatures of 1400, 1425, 1450, 1475 and 1500 \u2103, respectively. To further confirm the phase structures of BCZT ceramics sintered under different temperatures, Raman spectra were measured and shown in. It is worth noting that, BCZT has a basic matrix of BTO with the perovskite structure, so that the Raman modes are considered to be the same with that of the pure BTO. The Raman peaks of BTO with T phase are detected at approximately 250, 300, 520, and 720 cmE^{\u22121}, which correspond to the Raman modes of A1(TO2), E(TO2), A1(TO3) and A1(LO3)/E(LO3), respectively. The broadening and weakening of the Raman peaks at 150\u2013350 cmE^{\u22121} indicate the coexistence of the T and O phases. Therefore, the results of Raman spectroscopy also show the coexistence of T and O phases, which is consistent with the previous discussion of XRD results. Furthermore, we focus on the influence of sintering temperature on the microstructures of cylinder-shaped BCZT ceramics. The microstructures of BCZT ceramic plates sintered from 1400 to 1500 \xb0C were characterized by SEM and were shown in a to e, respectively. The SEM images indicate that the microstructures of BCZT ceramics would be significantly affected by the sintering temperatures. The microstructure of BCZT ceramic sintered at 1400 \xb0C is loose with the appearance of pores, and the grains are not uniform with a small average grain size of 16.52 \u03bcm, as shown in a. From b, we can observe that the grains of ceramic sintered at 1425 \xb0C are still not dense. However, the average grain size has increased to 17.81 \u03bcm. When the sintering temperature increased to 1450 \xb0C, the SEM image demonstrates that the grains are dense without obvious pores. More importantly, the distribution of grain size becomes more uniform and the average grain size increases to 22.30 \u03bcm. As the sintering temperature continually increased to 1475 \xb0C, the grain keeps rising with the appearance of some small voids, resulting in the abnormal growth of some grains. The average grain size has increased to 24.68 \u03bcm, as displayed in d. At 1500 \xb0C in f, the average grain size increases to 28.22 \u03bcm. Finally, the average grain sizes G a of BCZT ceramics sintered under various temperatures have been plotted in f. Based on the analyzation of microstructures of sintered ceramics, the optimal sintering temperature is considered as 1450 \xb0C to obtain the ceramic with dense and uniform grains. To demonstrate the performance of sintered ceramic plates, the ferroelectric properties of the plates were tested with a maximum electric field of 30 kV/cm at room temperature. While, the values of polarization at 30 kV/cm and the residual polarization are highly related to the sintering temperature. The maximum polarization values at 30 kV/cm are 21.14, 21.39, 22.02, 21.02, and 20.44 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} for the plates sintered at 1400, 1425, 1450, 1475, and 1500 \xb0C, respectively. Correspondingly, the residual polarizations are measured as 11.14, 10.67, 12.42, 10.95, and 8.87 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}. b shows the electroinduced strains under an electric field for the BCZT ceramic plates sintered under different temperatures. Based on the butterfly curves, the maximum values of plates sintered at 1400, 1425, 1450, 1475, and 1500 \xb0C could reach 0.117, 0.131, 0.141, 0.132, and 0.115 %, respectively. Therefore, the results indicate that the ceramic plate sintered at 1450 \xb0C exhibits the best ferroelectric and electrostriction properties, which have demonstrated the determination of microstructure on the ferroelectric property. According to previous characterizations of sintered ceramic powder and cylinder-shaped ceramic plates, the optimal sintering temperature would be 1450 \xb0C to obtain pure phase and high-quality sintered ceramic plates. Here, the plate with a cylinder shape and the plate with a specific frustum of a cone with an angle of 12.5\xb0 were selected as examples to indicate the effect of flexoelectricity on the piezoelectric performance. The cross-sectional SEM images of these two ceramic plates are shown in a and b. a shows the cross-sectional SEM image of an ordinary cylinder-shaped ceramic plate. The labeled angle exhibits 90\xb0. The cross-sectional SEM image of the plate with a specific frustum of a cone is shown in b and demonstrates the strong asymmetry of the plate. The angle labeled in b is about 12.5\xb0. After measuring the sizes, we could clearly observe that the radii of the lower and upper circles are 4 mm and 1.5 mm, respectively. Meanwhile, the height of the plate is measured as 0.6 mm. Then, the ferroelectric, electrostriction, and dielectric properties of BCZT ceramic plates sintered at 1450 \xb0C with different shapes were studied, as shown in a-c. Here, the cylinder-shaped plate is defined as 1450-C, while the frustum-of-a-cone-shaped plate is labeled as 1450-F. From a, the values of polarization values at 30 kV/cm for 1450-C and 1450-F are 22 and 20.74 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, respectively. The values of remanent polarization are 11.53 and 11.45 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, respectively. However, as shown in b, there is a significant difference between the butterfly curves of 1450-C and 1450-F. The maximum values of electroinduced strain under the electric field of 30 kV/cm are 0.141 % and 0.15 %, respectively, indicating a significant increase in the asymmetrical shape of the frustum of a cone. This result may be attributed to the asymmetric-shape-induced strain gradient. c shows the temperature-dependent relative dielectric constant and dielectric loss of 1450-C and 1450-F at a frequency of 1 kHz. As seen from the curves, a peak of dielectric constant is at around 40 \xb0C for both samples of 1450-C and 1450-F, which corresponds to the phase transition from the O phase to the T phase. Moreover, the Curie temperatures T c (i.e., from ferroelectric T phase to paraelectric phase) for the ceramic plates of both shapes are around 90 \xb0C. In order to have a comparison of piezoelectric performance of traditional cylinder-shaped plate (labeled as \u201cC\u201d in a and b) and frustum-of-a-cone-shaped plate (labeled as \u201cF\u201d in a and b), cylinder-shaped and frustum-of-a-cone-shaped ceramic plates sintered under various temperatures from 1400 to 1500 \xb0C were fabricated and measured. The converse piezoelectric coefficient d 33* (calculated by d 33*=S max /E max with S max being the maximum strain under the maximum electric field E max ) and piezoelectric coefficient d 33 were plotted in a and b, respectively. The d 33* of cylinder-shaped BCZT ceramics sintered at 1400, 1425, 1450, 1475, and 1500 \xb0C are 391.2, 437.7, 470.3, 437.8 and 387.7 pm/V, respectively. Meanwhile, the d 33 are 385.5, 417, 467.1, 435.8 and 373.3 pC/N, respectively. Importantly, for the plates sintered at 1400, 1425, 1450, 1475 and 1500 \xb0C with the shape of a frustum of a cone shape, the d 33* of plates are 414.6, 458.5, 501.4, 463.7, and 426.9 pm/V, respectively. The d 33 are 451.5, 460.8, 524.7, 479.8 and 434.9 pC/N, respectively. For the frustum-of-a-cone-shaped plate sintered at 1400 \xb0C, the performance of ceramic arrived at an excellent level of d 33* =501.4 pm/V and d 33= 524.7 pC/N. The increases of piezoelectric coefficient \u0394d 33 reach 66.0, 43.8, 57.6, 44.0, and 61.6 pC/N between the frustum-of-a-cone-shaped plate and the cylinder-shaped plate sintered from 1400 \xb0C to 1500 \xb0C, respectively. Meanwhile, the corresponding increase rates are 17.1 %, 10.5 %, 12.3 %, 10.1 %, and 16.5 %, respectively. To analyze the determination of shape on piezoelectric response, the finite element simulations were performed by using COMSOL Multiphysics 6.2 to obtain the strain distribution in plates under mechanical loads. Similar to the configurations in the piezoelectric coefficient measurement using a quasi-static d 33 meter, spherical indenters were employed to apply the mechanical loads at the upper and lower surfaces. Finally, we also revealed the performance of ceramic plates with various shapes of frustum of a cone by changing the angle from 12.5\xb0 to 90\xb0 (i.e., cylinder-shaped). Then, the electrostrictive butterfly curves and piezoelectric coefficient d 33 were measured for the plates with different shapes (i.e., the angle from 12.5\xb0 to 90\xb0), as depicted in. Here, all measured ceramics were sintered at 1450 \xb0C. the electrostrictive butterfly curves indicate that the electroinduced strains are symmetrical for the cylinder-shaped plates under the 30 kV/cm and \u221230 kV/cm. While the electroinduced strains exhibit a strong asymmetry for the plates with other shapes under the 30 kV/cm and \u221230 kV/cm. Under the applied electric field of \u221230 kV/cm, the electroinduced strain decreases with the rising of the angle. According to the results, the plate with 12.5\xb0 exhibits the best performance in electroinduced strain and piezoelectric response. The piezoelectric coefficient of the plate with 12.5\xb0 is as high as 520.1 \xb1 3.30 pC/N. With the increase of the angle, the piezoelectric coefficient is gradually decreasing to 462.2 \xb1 3.61 pC/N. From the SEM images, we could clearly obvious that the grains are dense and with uniform grain sizes, indicating the high-quality of as-prepared plates. The ceramic densities are 5.376, 5.395, 5.434, 5.285, and 5.333 g/cmE^{3} for the plates with the angles of 12.5\xb0, 25\xb0, 50\xb0, 75\xb0, and 90\xb0, respectively. In addition, the BCZT ceramics studied in this work were prepared by the traditional solid-phase reaction method. On the other hand, if the sol-gel method is employed to synthesize the BCZT ceramic powders, the results may have significant differences. The quality of the ceramic plate should be improved, which benefits to further improve the piezoelectric performance of BCZT ceramic.

# INTRODUCTION
Among a large number of piezoelectric ceramics, PbZrO3-PbTiO3 (PZT) ceramics have captured most of the piezoelectric ceramics market and widely used in most electronic devices due to their excellent piezoelectric properties. In recent years, various lead-free ceramic materials, e.g., (Bi,Na)TiO3 (BNT), BaTiO3 (BTO), (K,Na)NbO3 (KNN), etc., have appeared, investigated, and applied. Among the lead-free ceramics, BT-based ceramics are considered to be one of the most promising lead-free ceramics due to their high piezoelectric constant d 33 and dielectric constant. BTO ceramics are polycrystalline piezoelectric ceramics with perovskite structure. Researchers have been committed to improving the piezoelectric and dielectric properties of BT ceramics because their piezoelectric properties are not comparable to those of lead-based ceramics. It is found that the multiple solid solutions formed by BTO and other lead-free components have a great improvement on the performance of ceramics, especially the formation of morphotropic phase boundary (MPB). Ye et al. prepared (Ba1-x Ca x )(Ti0.9Zr0.1)O3 ceramics and revealed that the MPB between the rhombic and the tetragonal phases were found in the ceramic with x = 0.15. Near the MPB, the piezoelectric and dielectric properties of the ceramics were significantly improved, and the piezoelectric constant can reach 350 pC/N. However, compared with lead-based ceramics, the piezoelectric performance of the BTO-based ceramics is not enough for practical applications. Therefore, how to further improve the piezoelectric properties of BTO-based ceramics becomes an important scientific issue. In 2007, Cross et al. designed a simple device. By using (Ba,Sr)TiO3 as a dielectric material, the devices in the range of 10\u2013100 \u03bcm have been fabricated. Due to the flexoelectric effect, the devices exhibit effective piezoelectric coefficients of up to 40 pC NE^{\u22121}. Xia et al. demonstrated the piezoelectric-flexoelectric effect for harvesting vibrational energy in a ferroelectric ITO/Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3/Ag cantilever device. The positive peak output current of the ITO/Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3/Ag device based on the flexoelectric effect is only 45 nA, which is increased to 90 nA by coupling piezoelectric and flexoelectric effects. Among a large number of lead-free materials, BTO-based ceramic materials exhibit good dielectric properties, especially the (Ba1-x Ca x )(Ti0.9Zr0.1)O3 ceramics. The relative dielectric constant of (Ba1-x Ca x )(Ti0.9Zr0.1)O3 ceramics can exceed 12,000 , indicating great potential for obtaining a high flexoelectric effect. In this work, the synergistic effects of piezoelectricity and flexoelectricity in ferroelectric (Ba0.85Ca0.15)(Ti0.9Zr0.1)O3 (BCZT) ceramics were investigated. Firstly, we have optimized the properties of BCZT ceramics by selecting the sintering temperatures. Furthermore, we also observed the d 33 coefficient was highly related to the shape of the ceramic plate.

# CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we have investigated the influence of sintering temperature on the phase, microstructure and electric properties of lead-free BCZT ceramics which were fabricated by traditional solid-phase reaction method. SEM images demonstrated that the cylinder-shaped BCZT ceramic plate sintered at 1450 \xb0C is denser with lower porosity than plates sintered at other temperatures. Moreover, the ceramic plate sintered at 1450 \xb0C exhibits excellent ferroelectric and electrostrictive properties. The cylinder-shaped BCZT ceramic plate sintered at 1450 \xb0C presents a piezoelectric coefficient d 33 of \u223c467.1 pC/N and large electroinduced strain of \u223c0.141 % at room temperature. The BCZT ceramic plates with frustums of a cone exhibit better effective piezoelectric outputs, e.g., the effective piezoelectric coefficient is 10.1\u223c17.1 % higher than that of the traditional cylinder-shaped BCZT ceramic plate, and d 33 could reach 524.7 pC/N.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
a shows the summarized XRD patterns of BCZT ceramics sintered at different temperatures from 1400 to 1500 \xb0C. According to the XRD patterns, all samples exhibit pure perovskite structures without any other heterogeneous peaks. It can be considered that CaE^{2+} has diffused to the A position of BaE^{2+}, ZrE^{4+} has diffused to the B position of TiE^{4+}, and CaE^{2+} and ZrE^{4+} have completely diffused into the BaTiO3 lattice to form a solid solution. The XRD patterns were profile-matched using Fullprof, refined using the Rietveld refinement method, and displayed in a\u2212e. The refined results show a good agreement between the measured XRD spectra and the fitted theoretical results. According to the lattice parameters obtained by refined results, the ceramics sintered from 1400 to 1500 \xb0C exhibit the coexistence of tetragonal (T) and orthorhombic (O) phases, which are very consistent with the P4mm and Amm2 models, respectively. The analyzed lattice parameters (i.e., a, b, c), refinement parameters (i.e., \uab53 E^{2}, R p, R wp , R exp ), and phase composition were summarized in. Then, the Debye-Scherrer formula was used to calculate the average size of particle size at different sintering temperatures, which could be expressed as follows , where k (k = 0.89) is the Scherrer constant, \u03b2 is the width at half maximum (FWHM) of the XRD peak, \u03b8 is the Bragg angle, \u03bb is the wavelength of X-ray (i.e, 1.5406 \xc5). For each sintering temperature, we have calculated the above parameters, i.e., 2\u03b8 (in degree), FWHM (in degree), \u03b2 (in rad), D (in nm), hkl, d hkl (in \xc5), and displayed in Tabs. S1-S5. Here, Bragg's law, i.e., 2 d hklsin\u03b8=n\u03bb, is employed to calculate d hkl with n being the diffraction order. The average particle sizes (D) calculated by the Debye-Scherrer formula are 28.24, 29.58, 29.85, 30.64, and 31.02 nm for the sintering temperatures of 1400, 1425, 1450, 1475 and 1500 \u2103, respectively. To further confirm the phase structures of BCZT ceramics sintered under different temperatures, Raman spectra were measured and shown in. It is worth noting that, BCZT has a basic matrix of BTO with the perovskite structure, so that the Raman modes are considered to be the same with that of the pure BTO. The Raman peaks of BTO with T phase are detected at approximately 250, 300, 520, and 720 cmE^{\u22121}, which correspond to the Raman modes of A1(TO2), E(TO2), A1(TO3) and A1(LO3)/E(LO3), respectively. The broadening and weakening of the Raman peaks at 150\u2013350 cmE^{\u22121} indicate the coexistence of the T and O phases. Therefore, the results of Raman spectroscopy also show the coexistence of T and O phases, which is consistent with the previous discussion of XRD results. Furthermore, we focus on the influence of sintering temperature on the microstructures of cylinder-shaped BCZT ceramics. The microstructures of BCZT ceramic plates sintered from 1400 to 1500 \xb0C were characterized by SEM and were shown in a to e, respectively. The SEM images indicate that the microstructures of BCZT ceramics would be significantly affected by the sintering temperatures. The microstructure of BCZT ceramic sintered at 1400 \xb0C is loose with the appearance of pores, and the grains are not uniform with a small average grain size of 16.52 \u03bcm, as shown in a. From b, we can observe that the grains of ceramic sintered at 1425 \xb0C are still not dense. However, the average grain size has increased to 17.81 \u03bcm. When the sintering temperature increased to 1450 \xb0C, the SEM image demonstrates that the grains are dense without obvious pores. More importantly, the distribution of grain size becomes more uniform and the average grain size increases to 22.30 \u03bcm. As the sintering temperature continually increased to 1475 \xb0C, the grain keeps rising with the appearance of some small voids, resulting in the abnormal growth of some grains. The average grain size has increased to 24.68 \u03bcm, as displayed in d. At 1500 \xb0C in f, the average grain size increases to 28.22 \u03bcm. Finally, the average grain sizes G a of BCZT ceramics sintered under various temperatures have been plotted in f. Based on the analyzation of microstructures of sintered ceramics, the optimal sintering temperature is considered as 1450 \xb0C to obtain the ceramic with dense and uniform grains. To demonstrate the performance of sintered ceramic plates, the ferroelectric properties of the plates were tested with a maximum electric field of 30 kV/cm at room temperature. While, the values of polarization at 30 kV/cm and the residual polarization are highly related to the sintering temperature. The maximum polarization values at 30 kV/cm are 21.14, 21.39, 22.02, 21.02, and 20.44 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} for the plates sintered at 1400, 1425, 1450, 1475, and 1500 \xb0C, respectively. Correspondingly, the residual polarizations are measured as 11.14, 10.67, 12.42, 10.95, and 8.87 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}. b shows the electroinduced strains under an electric field for the BCZT ceramic plates sintered under different temperatures. Based on the butterfly curves, the maximum values of plates sintered at 1400, 1425, 1450, 1475, and 1500 \xb0C could reach 0.117, 0.131, 0.141, 0.132, and 0.115 %, respectively. Therefore, the results indicate that the ceramic plate sintered at 1450 \xb0C exhibits the best ferroelectric and electrostriction properties, which have demonstrated the determination of microstructure on the ferroelectric property. According to previous characterizations of sintered ceramic powder and cylinder-shaped ceramic plates, the optimal sintering temperature would be 1450 \xb0C to obtain pure phase and high-quality sintered ceramic plates. Here, the plate with a cylinder shape and the plate with a specific frustum of a cone with an angle of 12.5\xb0 were selected as examples to indicate the effect of flexoelectricity on the piezoelectric performance. The cross-sectional SEM images of these two ceramic plates are shown in a and b. a shows the cross-sectional SEM image of an ordinary cylinder-shaped ceramic plate. The labeled angle exhibits 90\xb0. The cross-sectional SEM image of the plate with a specific frustum of a cone is shown in b and demonstrates the strong asymmetry of the plate. The angle labeled in b is about 12.5\xb0. After measuring the sizes, we could clearly observe that the radii of the lower and upper circles are 4 mm and 1.5 mm, respectively. Meanwhile, the height of the plate is measured as 0.6 mm. Then, the ferroelectric, electrostriction, and dielectric properties of BCZT ceramic plates sintered at 1450 \xb0C with different shapes were studied, as shown in a-c. Here, the cylinder-shaped plate is defined as 1450-C, while the frustum-of-a-cone-shaped plate is labeled as 1450-F. From a, the values of polarization values at 30 kV/cm for 1450-C and 1450-F are 22 and 20.74 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, respectively. The values of remanent polarization are 11.53 and 11.45 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, respectively. However, as shown in b, there is a significant difference between the butterfly curves of 1450-C and 1450-F. The maximum values of electroinduced strain under the electric field of 30 kV/cm are 0.141 % and 0.15 %, respectively, indicating a significant increase in the asymmetrical shape of the frustum of a cone. This result may be attributed to the asymmetric-shape-induced strain gradient. c shows the temperature-dependent relative dielectric constant and dielectric loss of 1450-C and 1450-F at a frequency of 1 kHz. As seen from the curves, a peak of dielectric constant is at around 40 \xb0C for both samples of 1450-C and 1450-F, which corresponds to the phase transition from the O phase to the T phase. Moreover, the Curie temperatures T c (i.e., from ferroelectric T phase to paraelectric phase) for the ceramic plates of both shapes are around 90 \xb0C. In order to have a comparison of piezoelectric performance of traditional cylinder-shaped plate (labeled as \u201cC\u201d in a and b) and frustum-of-a-cone-shaped plate (labeled as \u201cF\u201d in a and b), cylinder-shaped and frustum-of-a-cone-shaped ceramic plates sintered under various temperatures from 1400 to 1500 \xb0C were fabricated and measured. The converse piezoelectric coefficient d 33* (calculated by d 33*=S max /E max with S max being the maximum strain under the maximum electric field E max ) and piezoelectric coefficient d 33 were plotted in a and b, respectively. The d 33* of cylinder-shaped BCZT ceramics sintered at 1400, 1425, 1450, 1475, and 1500 \xb0C are 391.2, 437.7, 470.3, 437.8 and 387.7 pm/V, respectively. Meanwhile, the d 33 are 385.5, 417, 467.1, 435.8 and 373.3 pC/N, respectively. Importantly, for the plates sintered at 1400, 1425, 1450, 1475 and 1500 \xb0C with the shape of a frustum of a cone shape, the d 33* of plates are 414.6, 458.5, 501.4, 463.7, and 426.9 pm/V, respectively. The d 33 are 451.5, 460.8, 524.7, 479.8 and 434.9 pC/N, respectively. For the frustum-of-a-cone-shaped plate sintered at 1400 \xb0C, the performance of ceramic arrived at an excellent level of d 33* =501.4 pm/V and d 33= 524.7 pC/N. The increases of piezoelectric coefficient \u0394d 33 reach 66.0, 43.8, 57.6, 44.0, and 61.6 pC/N between the frustum-of-a-cone-shaped plate and the cylinder-shaped plate sintered from 1400 \xb0C to 1500 \xb0C, respectively. Meanwhile, the corresponding increase rates are 17.1 %, 10.5 %, 12.3 %, 10.1 %, and 16.5 %, respectively. To analyze the determination of shape on piezoelectric response, the finite element simulations were performed by using COMSOL Multiphysics 6.2 to obtain the strain distribution in plates under mechanical loads. Similar to the configurations in the piezoelectric coefficient measurement using a quasi-static d 33 meter, spherical indenters were employed to apply the mechanical loads at the upper and lower surfaces. Finally, we also revealed the performance of ceramic plates with various shapes of frustum of a cone by changing the angle from 12.5\xb0 to 90\xb0 (i.e., cylinder-shaped). Then, the electrostrictive butterfly curves and piezoelectric coefficient d 33 were measured for the plates with different shapes (i.e., the angle from 12.5\xb0 to 90\xb0), as depicted in. Here, all measured ceramics were sintered at 1450 \xb0C. the electrostrictive butterfly curves indicate that the electroinduced strains are symmetrical for the cylinder-shaped plates under the 30 kV/cm and \u221230 kV/cm. While the electroinduced strains exhibit a strong asymmetry for the plates with other shapes under the 30 kV/cm and \u221230 kV/cm. Under the applied electric field of \u221230 kV/cm, the electroinduced strain decreases with the rising of the angle. According to the results, the plate with 12.5\xb0 exhibits the best performance in electroinduced strain and piezoelectric response. The piezoelectric coefficient of the plate with 12.5\xb0 is as high as 520.1 \xb1 3.30 pC/N. With the increase of the angle, the piezoelectric coefficient is gradually decreasing to 462.2 \xb1 3.61 pC/N. From the SEM images, we could clearly obvious that the grains are dense and with uniform grain sizes, indicating the high-quality of as-prepared plates. The ceramic densities are 5.376, 5.395, 5.434, 5.285, and 5.333 g/cmE^{3} for the plates with the angles of 12.5\xb0, 25\xb0, 50\xb0, 75\xb0, and 90\xb0, respectively. In addition, the BCZT ceramics studied in this work were prepared by the traditional solid-phase reaction method. On the other hand, if the sol-gel method is employed to synthesize the BCZT ceramic powders, the results may have significant differences. The quality of the ceramic plate should be improved, which benefits to further improve the piezoelectric performance of BCZT ceramic.

# INTRODUCTION
Among a large number of piezoelectric ceramics, PbZrO3-PbTiO3 (PZT) ceramics have captured most of the piezoelectric ceramics market and widely used in most electronic devices due to their excellent piezoelectric properties. In recent years, various lead-free ceramic materials, e.g., (Bi,Na)TiO3 (BNT), BaTiO3 (BTO), (K,Na)NbO3 (KNN), etc., have appeared, investigated, and applied. Among the lead-free ceramics, BT-based ceramics are considered to be one of the most promising lead-free ceramics due to their high piezoelectric constant d 33 and dielectric constant. BTO ceramics are polycrystalline piezoelectric ceramics with perovskite structure. Researchers have been committed to improving the piezoelectric and dielectric properties of BT ceramics because their piezoelectric properties are not comparable to those of lead-based ceramics. It is found that the multiple solid solutions formed by BTO and other lead-free components have a great improvement on the performance of ceramics, especially the formation of morphotropic phase boundary (MPB). Ye et al. prepared (Ba1-x Ca x )(Ti0.9Zr0.1)O3 ceramics and revealed that the MPB between the rhombic and the tetragonal phases were found in the ceramic with x = 0.15. Near the MPB, the piezoelectric and dielectric properties of the ceramics were significantly improved, and the piezoelectric constant can reach 350 pC/N. However, compared with lead-based ceramics, the piezoelectric performance of the BTO-based ceramics is not enough for practical applications. Therefore, how to further improve the piezoelectric properties of BTO-based ceramics becomes an important scientific issue. In 2007, Cross et al. designed a simple device. By using (Ba,Sr)TiO3 as a dielectric material, the devices in the range of 10\u2013100 \u03bcm have been fabricated. Due to the flexoelectric effect, the devices exhibit effective piezoelectric coefficients of up to 40 pC NE^{\u22121}. Xia et al. demonstrated the piezoelectric-flexoelectric effect for harvesting vibrational energy in a ferroelectric ITO/Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3/Ag cantilever device. The positive peak output current of the ITO/Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3/Ag device based on the flexoelectric effect is only 45 nA, which is increased to 90 nA by coupling piezoelectric and flexoelectric effects. Among a large number of lead-free materials, BTO-based ceramic materials exhibit good dielectric properties, especially the (Ba1-x Ca x )(Ti0.9Zr0.1)O3 ceramics. The relative dielectric constant of (Ba1-x Ca x )(Ti0.9Zr0.1)O3 ceramics can exceed 12,000 , indicating great potential for obtaining a high flexoelectric effect. In this work, the synergistic effects of piezoelectricity and flexoelectricity in ferroelectric (Ba0.85Ca0.15)(Ti0.9Zr0.1)O3 (BCZT) ceramics were investigated. Firstly, we have optimized the properties of BCZT ceramics by selecting the sintering temperatures. Furthermore, we also observed the d 33 coefficient was highly related to the shape of the ceramic plate.

# CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we have investigated the influence of sintering temperature on the phase, microstructure and electric properties of lead-free BCZT ceramics which were fabricated by traditional solid-phase reaction method. SEM images demonstrated that the cylinder-shaped BCZT ceramic plate sintered at 1450 \xb0C is denser with lower porosity than plates sintered at other temperatures. Moreover, the ceramic plate sintered at 1450 \xb0C exhibits excellent ferroelectric and electrostrictive properties. The cylinder-shaped BCZT ceramic plate sintered at 1450 \xb0C presents a piezoelectric coefficient d 33 of \u223c467.1 pC/N and large electroinduced strain of \u223c0.141 % at room temperature. The BCZT ceramic plates with frustums of a cone exhibit better effective piezoelectric outputs, e.g., the effective piezoelectric coefficient is 10.1\u223c17.1 % higher than that of the traditional cylinder-shaped BCZT ceramic plate, and d 33 could reach 524.7 pC/N.

**Notes**:
- Write complete chemical formulas (e.g. '(Use the abbreviation key-value pair to track the abbreviations while extracting composition-property keywords). Don't use abbreviations, but you can use different environment if multiple compositions have different d33 values in different environments. For e.g.: 'LiNbO3-Air' and 'LiNbO3-Vacuum'.
- If multiple compositions are mentioned with different d33 values, extract all compositions mentioning different type/environment with a '-' and coreresponding d33 values.
- Mos of the formula are provided in ABSTRACT or INTRODUCTION or first part of EXPERIMENTAL SYNTHESIS.
- Use element symbols (e.g. 'K' not 'Potassium')
- For compositions with variables:
   * If multiple d33 values exist: Extract all compositions by substituting each variable value
   * If single d33 value: Extract only the best composition
- Prioritize data from tables
- Preserve proper chemical notation including:
   * Subscripts for atom counts
   * Parentheses for grouped elements
   * Proper fraction formatting

", agent="Material Composition and Property Extractor", status="completed", output="I need to extract the material compositions, their corresponding d33 values, the unit for d33, and the material family from the provided text. I also need to identify any abbreviations for the compositions.

Here's my plan:
1.  **Identify the main composition**: The title and abstract clearly state "Ba0.85Ca0.15Zr0.10Ti0.90O3". This is also abbreviated as BCZT.
2.  **Scan for d33 values and associated compositions/conditions**:
    *   "The d 33 of cylinder-shaped BCZT ceramics sintered at 1400, 1425, 1450, 1475, and 1500 Â°C are ... 385.5, 417, 467.1, 435.8 and 373.3 pC/N, respectively."
    *   "for the plates sintered at 1400, 1425, 1450, 1475 and 1500 Â°C with the shape of a frustum of a cone shape, the d 33 are 451.5, 460.8, 524.7, 479.8 and 434.9 pC/N, respectively."
    *   "The piezoelectric coefficient of the plate with 12.5Â° is as high as 520.1 Â± 3.30 pC/N. With the increase of the angle, the piezoelectric coefficient is gradually decreasing to 462.2 Â± 3.61 pC/N." (These are for ceramics sintered at 1450 Â°C with varying angles).
3.  **Determine the unit**: The unit for d33 is consistently "pC/N".
4.  **Identify the family**: The text mentions "BT-based ceramics" and "BTO-based ceramics". The main composition is a derivative of BaTiO3. So, "BaTiO3" or "BT-based" would be appropriate. I will use "BaTiO3".
5.  **Format the output**: Create the JSON structure as specified, including compositions with their d33 values, the abbreviation, the unit, and the family. For compositions with different sintering temperatures or shapes, I will specify these conditions in the composition string.

I will use the more precise 462.2 for the 90 degree case here as it's explicitly mentioned in this context.)

I will ensure the composition strings are unique by including the sintering temperature and shape information.```json
