", agent="Synthesis Data Formatter", status="completed", output="Thought: I need to format the provided synthesis data.
I will keep 'steps' and 'precursors' as they are, as per the instructions.
For 'method' and 'characterization_techniques', I will check if allowed entities are provided. Since no allowed entities are provided in the prompt for 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques', I will keep their original values.

Therefore, the 'method' will remain 'solid-state reaction'.
The 'precursors' will remain `['Bi2O3', 'TiO2', 'Fe2O3', 'Yb2O3', 'ZrO2 balls', 'ethanol', 'polyvinyl alcohol']`.
The 'steps' will remain as the provided list of strings.
The 'characterization_techniques' will remain `['X-ray diffractometer (XRD)', 'Raman spectrometer', 'field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM)', 'impedance analyzer', 'multimeter', 'source meter', 'TF 2000E Analyzer', 'YE2730A d33 meter']`.{
