", agent="Synthesis Data Formatter", status="completed", output="Thought: The user wants me to format the provided synthesis data.
I need to:
1. Keep 'method' as 'Solid-state reaction' since no allowed entities are provided for 'methods'.
2. Keep 'precursors' as they are: ['BaCO3', 'TiO2', 'SnO2', 'CaCO3', 'Bi2O3', 'Fe2O3'].
3. Keep 'steps' as they are.
4. Keep 'characterization_techniques' as they are since no allowed entities are provided for 'characterization_techniques'.

Therefore, I will return the dictionary with the original values for all fields.```json
