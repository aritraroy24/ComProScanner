# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The crystal structure analysis is examined by XRD patterns and microstructure analysis by FESEM images of PZT films. (a) shows the XRD pattern of PZT films grown on different buffer layers. The theta/2-theta scan is carried out on all the films to investigate the influence of different buffer layers on the orientation of the PZT films. All the peaks were indexed using the JCPDS card no: 033\u20130784 belongs to the PZT tetragonal crystal system. The studied buffer layers were evaluated on the basis of near lattice matching with PZT lattice i.e., PZT (a=b=4.01 \xc5), LNO (a=b=3.86 \xc5) and anatase TiO (a=b=3.80 \xc5). All the PZT films are grown under the same process conditions. (a) illustrate the preferential orientation i.e., (100) and (111) of PZT films on LNO and TiO buffers respectively, whereas it shows random orientations on LNO/TiO buffer. The obtained preferential orientation of PZT on LNO and TiO is in well agreed with the previous reports. Furthermore, it is also observed that the (111) peak of PZT faded on LNO/TiO buffer. To quantify the degree of orientation, the relative peak intensity calculation is performed on PZT films using the following equation: where I (100) , I (110) , and I (111) refer to the XRD peak intensities of (100), (110), and (111) planes. The calculated \u03b1 (100) values are 28 % for Pt, 20 % for TiO, 96 % for LNO and 33 % for LNO/TiO. Among the buffer interface LNO shows the highest preferential orientation and the second highest is shown by LNO/TiO buffered PZT film. It is believed that the formation of intermediate phase Pb-La promotes the crystallization of (100) nucleation, which has the lowest surface energy. To address this, the 2-theta scan were carried out on only buffer layers i.e., LNO, TiO and LNO/TiO on Pt substrate ahead to PZT deposition. (b) and (c) depicts the close insight of the only TiO and TiO on LNO buffer explicate the crystallization phase of both TiO\u2019s are different. The significant differences in intensity of TiO\u2019s might be due to factors such as nucleation behaviour and strain effects induced by LNO buffer, which leads to improvement in crystalline quality of TiO film on Pt and Pt/LNO substrates. The high intense XRD peak shows preferential growth of TiO anatase phase along c-axis direction on LNO seed layer. The in-plane compressive stress applied by the underneath LNO buffer might be the causes for this preferential c-axis oriented TiO anatase phase. This study reveals that the introduction of LNO buffer has significant changes in the crystalline quality of TiO2 and also facilitates the formation of tetragonal perovskite pahse (PbTiO3) at the LNO/TiO/PZT interface. To determine the lattice parameter of PZT films, the 2-theta scan XRD was executed at a small grazing angle (\u03b8 = 1\xb0) to exclude the substrate peaks. The Rietveld refinement is carried out by using the tetragonal P4 mm space group (Cif file:1521044, COD database) of PZT bulk crystal system and refinement is carried out in Full proof software ( in SI) and the obtained values are tabulated in. (d) displays a comparison plot of the a-lattice parameter and c/a ratio of PZT films on different buffers. By theoretical approach, it is foreseen that the a-lattice parameter of buffer LNO and TiO would have influence on the PZT a-lattice parameter. The theoretical hypothesis was well-aligned with the obtained a-lattice parameters of PZT film on LNO and LNO/TiO buffers. This clearly states that there is a buffer layer induced in-plane (+/-) stresses at the Pt/PZT interface. The schematic atomic structure of PZT film on different buffers on Pt substrate has been created using Vesta software using CIF files and depicted in. The atomic structure shows the lattice matching buffer layer induced compressive stress on PZT lattice. It is well-understood from the atomic structure representations that the stress induced by different buffer layers on PZT lattice will have influenced on its ferro and piezoelectric properties. Qin et al. reported that the compressive stress on the substrate promotes the (100) and tensile stress promotes (111) orientation of PZT film , which is in good agreement with our XRD results. Another discrepancy is the decrease in c/a ratio on LNO buffer and increase in c/a ratio on LNO/TiO buffer of PZT films are still-in debate. This further confirm that the TiO layer deposited on Pt and Pt/LNO are disparate and their surface energy and the nucleation behaviour of PZT film will also dissimilar. From the previous studies it is revealed, the increase in c/a ratio might be due to the favourable nucleation of PbTiO3 (PTO) phase at the TiO/PZT interface. The increase in \u03b1(100) value of PZT on LNO/TiO interface also evident this anomaly. These results further confirms that the TiO grown on LNO has low surface energy which promotes either (100) or (110) orientation of PZT film. shows the FESEM morphology of PZT films on different buffer layers. To examined further the average grain size distribution was measured using imageJ software and the extracted grain size were interpreted by Gaussian fit using origin software ( in SI). The histogram gaussian fit images is incorporated within FESEM images. The average grain size of PZT were as follows; 487, 200, 100 and 134 nm on Pt, TiO, LNO and LNO/TiO buffer layers respectively. This shows that the nucleation behaviour of PZT film is disparate in all the films. The smaller and uniform grain size indicates that there is a significant change in the interfacial energy on LNO buffer. From the FESEM images the thickness to grain size aspect ratio was examined and it implies the degree of columnar structure and the values are 1.54 (Pt), 4.5 (TiO), 9.1 (LNO) and 6.34 (LNO/TiO) ( in SI). The highest columnar structure on LNO buffer layer is attributed to decrease in misfit strain or internal energy due to lattice-matched interface. These findings support the highly textured (100) oriented PZT film on LNO buffer. These difference in the nucleation behaviour and the grain size distribution will have influence on the ferroelectric and dielectric properties of PZT films. a shows the polarization vs electric field hysteresis loops of PZT films on different buffer layers. All the films show strong ferroelectric switching characteristic with applied electric field. b shows the comparison bar chart representing the saturated polarization (P max ) and remanent polarization (P r ) values of PZT films on different buffer layers. The highest P max value is shown by bare Pt and lowest by LNO buffer. It is reported that the P max value is higher for (111) oriented and lower for (100) oriented PZT films agrees well with our results. Typically, the ferroelectric properties were evaluated from the obtained P r values and it is related to the distortion of the TiO6 octahedra from its Centro-of symmetry along the poling axis. Overall, the ferroelectric property is decided by the P r /P max ratio and it is found to be 0.25(Pt), 0.236(TiO), 0.193(LNO) and 0.446(LNO/TiO) respectively. Though the c/a ratio of bare Pt and Pt/LNO/TiO are similar, however the significant increase in P r /P max ratio of LNO/TiO buffer is uncertain. The low P r value implies the population of ferroelastic domains (non-180\xb0 domains) is higher in LNO buffer. d) illustrate the formation of ferroelectric (180\xb0) and ferroelastic (90\xb0) domains due to in-plane compressive stress on tetragonal structure. Theoretically, to minimize the elastic energy the long cT-axis of the tetragonal cell will split in to ferroelectric 180\xb0 and ferroelastic non-180\xb0 domains. Due to the high compressive stress induced by the LNO layer favours the formation of 90\xb0 domains (aT-axis) inorder to reduce the elastic along cT-axis. From the XRD analysis it is inferred that the decrease in a-lattice and decrease in c/a ratio might be associated with the formation of non-180\xb0 domains of PZT film on LNO buffer. In the case of LNO/TiO the higher P r /P max value is associated to higher c/a ratio and reduced misfit strain. Other possible reason behind the high P r /P max values is the formation of PTO (PbTiO3) interface, which might increase the ferroelectric phase on LNO/TiO interface. Moreover, the high relative intensity \u03b1 (100)value of LNO/TiO/PZT compared to TiO/PZT film confirms the formation of PTO phase. Thus the underlying LNO buffer layer plays a vital role in the formation of tetragonal ferroelectric phase on the hetero-structured interface. The insight plot at b shows the coercive field (E c ) of PZT film on different buffers and it is found to be lower in LNO (100 kV/cm) and highest for both bare Pt and Pt/LNO/TiO (\u223c130 kV/cm). It is recognized that the smaller grains, columnar structure reduces the domain wall clamping and facilitates the easy domain wall motion leads to low E c in LNO buffered PZT film. The discrepant in the high E c value of PZT on bare Pt and on LNO/TiO is quite distinguishable. It is well-understood that the higher E c value in LNO/TiO is associated with the high P r value. In the case of bare Pt/PZT, though the P r is low but it shows higher E c value. These might be associate to the interface defect-dipoles includes oxygen vacancies or trapped free carriers at the grain boundaries which pinned the domains in Pt/PZT film. These findings emphasizes that the hetero-structured LNO/TiO buffer is favour over other buffer layer to grow stable ferroelectric domains. To validate the quality of the film, leakage current measurement was carried out using DC bias of 20 V at room temperature (c). The high switching current peak (\u223c1700 \xb5A/cmE^{2}) is shown by Pt/PZT and the lowest (400 \xb5A/cmE^{2}) is shown by Pt/LNO/PZT film. The asymmetricity in the switching current and peak splitting indicates the domain wall pinning effect is obvious at the Pt/PZT interface. The symmetric and low leakage current replicates the decrease in domain wall pinning due to lattice matched LNO/PZT interface. It is also believed that the introduction of LNO buffer reduces the interfacial energy and act as an oxygen source during voltage cycling, which leads to increase in life span of the ferroelectric device. To confirm the reliability of the ferroelectric domains the polarization fatigue measurements was carried out on Pt/PZT and Pt/LNO/TiO/PZT films ( in SI) and it was found to be stable on hetero-structed PZT films. depicts the room temperature piezoelectric properties of PZT films on different buffered platinum substrates. The measurements were carried out using a Radian Ferroelectric Tester in conjunction with a single-beam laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) at a frequency of 10 Hz. To mitigate substrate deformation, the test samples were initially glued to a thick glass plate with a 100 mm diameter and 5 mm thickness before the measurements were conducted. It is understood that the error margin for the single beam laser interferometer is approximately 50\u201370 % of the obtained values. The measured piezoelectric coefficient (d33,f) values for the PZT films, adjusted to account for a 50 % error margin (considering the samples were bonded to a thick glass holder), are 80, 153, 156 and 260 pm/V for Pt, Pt/TiO, Pt/LNO and Pt/LNO/TiO respectively. From this observation, it is evident that the hetero-structured PZT film exhibits a higher d33,f value compared to other buffers and Pt substrates. Previous study has also reported that randomly oriented PZT films demonstrate piezoelectric coefficient values that are eight times higher than those with (111) orientation and twice as high as those with (100) orientation. XRD analysis confirms that the hetero-structured PZT film exhibits random orientation, and the suppression of (111) peak further supports the high d33,f value obtained in this study. To investigate the thermodynamic stability of ferroelectric domains, all the films were examined under elevated temperature range from 30 \xb0C to 180 \xb0C. (a-d) depicts the leakage current plot vs voltage of PZT films deposited on different buffered Pt substrate at elevated temperature. From a, it is seen that the leakage current increases at higher temperature (180\xb0 C) indicates the pinned domain gets relaxed at elevated temperature. It is also observed the leakage current increases at higher voltage at elevated temperature obeys the thermal activation mechanism in both Pt/PZT and Pt/TiO/PZT films. From c and d, it is observed that there were very less significant changes in the leakage current values of PZT films on LNO and LNO/TiO buffer. The low leakage current replicates the presence of stable ferroelectric domains in Pt/LNO/TiO/PZT film. This study further confirms the introduction of TiO on LNO buffers facilitates the growth of stable ferroelectric phase and considerably reduces the population of defective-dipoles at the interface on LNO/TiO/PZT interface. To support the above findings the temperature dependent P-E hysteresis loop measurements ( ) were carried out on all the PZT films. The polarization values are inconsistent for all the PZT films except on LNO/TiO buffer. This further confirms the presence of defective interface that gets migrated into the bulk contribute to higher leakage current as observed on Pt/PZT film. In the case of only TiO2 buffer the PZT film lost its ferroelectric character and device failure occurs at < 150 \xb0C, this suggest the only TiO buffer is not the suitable buffer to obtain stable interface on Pt substrate. In summary, the introduction of hetero-structure buffers considerable reduces the defective-dipoles at the ferroelectric/electrode interface and thus improves the thermal stability of the ferroelectric domains. shows the dielectric constant and tan delta loss factor with increasing in frequency of PZT films on different buffer layers. The obtained dielectric values at 1 kHz and 1 Vac are as follows: 842, 1029, 1065, 935 and dielectric loss are 0.264, 0.108, 0.087, 0.068 for Pt, Pt/TiO, Pt/LNO and Pt/LNO/TiO respectively. According to Maxwell-Wagner effect, if the dielectric constant is higher then the loss factor also should be higher but it is not so in buffered PZT films. From the above discussions the reason for high dielectric constant on LNO are as follows; it is associated to the presence of easy non-180\xb0 domains switching, smaller and uniform grain size distribution and reduced misfit strain at the interface. In the case of bare Pt/PZT film, the low dielectric constant is attributed to the domain wall pinning includes oxygen vacancies at the interface which impedes the reorientation of polarization. The obtained lower tangent loss behaviour is consistent with the lower leakage current of the LNO buffer PZT film. It is also observed from the plot that the tangent loss increases at higher frequency (i.e., \u223c100 kHz) of PZT film on the heterojunction interface. The increase in dielectric loss of PZT film on heterostructure is attributed to the formation of thin leaky capacitive layer at the film/oxide interface. The finite conductance at LNO/TiO interface increases at specific frequency, leading to increase in dielectric loss. However, this effect is not observed in conducting oxide buffer (Pt/LNO/PZT). The slop is constant in LNO buffer and it is much steeper in bare Pt/PZT film further confirms the presence of the mobile charge defect is constrained at the buffer interface. Thus, the LNO/TiO buffer layers play a major role in obtaining device quality ferroelectric films with low leakage current on Pt substrates.

# TITLE
Improving the thermal stability of 180<sup>Â°</sup> domain switching by engineering the ferroelectric/electrode interface

# ABSTRACT
In this investigation, we engineered the interface by employing lattice-matching buffer layers (TiO2, LaNiO3, and LaNiO3/TiO2) on a Pt substrate to reduce defects at the Pt/PZT interface. XRD and SEM studies reveal highly textured and columnar grain structures on the buffered PZT films. The hetero-structured LNO/TiO/PZT interface shows enhanced polarizability (Pr/Pmax) and reduced leakage current. The piezoelectric properties shows higher d33,f value for the hetero-structure buffer PZT film. Frequency-dependent dielectric studies reveal enhanced dielectric properties with a low loss factor, likely due to the reduction of defect-dipoles at the LNO/TiO buffer interface.

# INTRODUCTION
It is known that the ferroelectric materials, especially a well-established PbZrTiO3 (PZT) films which have the capability of sensing as well as harvesting energy from mechanical vibration is an added advantages for using this material in smart sensing applications. The recent advancement in nano-fabrication and miniaturization technology have brought evolution in the development of embedded ferroelectric MEMS devices within the microfluidic channels for earlier diseases diagnosing, tagging data-over sounds, advanced piezo-MEMS speakers etc.. Several studies have been carried out for the past two decades to improve the electrical fatigue properties of PZT films. It is well-established from the previous work that the PZT film shows the decrease in polarization value due to fatigue beyond 10E^{6} cycles. Comprehensive studies on the leakage current and ferroelectric switching behaviour have been implemented on PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 (PZT) films with different buffer interface. For the PZT films, TiO2 (TiO), LaNiO3 (LNO) and LaNiO3/TiO2 (LNO/TiO) combination is selected as interfacial buffer candidates and explored how these buffer layers influence the defect-dipoles formation by analysing the ferroelectricity and leakage current behaviour at elevated temperatures.

# CONCLUSION
In summary, we have successfully grown PZT films on different buffers (TiO, LNO and LNO/TiO) and studied its functional properties. The XRD and FESEM analysis reveals the increase in tetragonality factor (c/a ratio) and columnar grain structure in LNO buffered PZT films. The ferroelectric properties reveal high P r /P max ratio with low leakage current in LNO/TiO/PZT film. The comprehensive studies on temperature dependent ferroelectric and leakage current shows considerable decrease in interface defects and it shows thermodynamically stable ferroelectric domains on Pt/LNO/TiO/PZT film. Thus, with this studies it is explored that the degradation mechanism in ferroelectric properties is associated to domain pinning due to oxygen vacancies at Pt/PZT interface. The increase in dielectric constant and decrease in loss factor on Pt/LNO/TiO/PZT stack is another remarkable achievement of this present work. The measured piezocoefficient values on this buffered PZT films shows higher at the hetero-structured buffer.

From the previous studies it is revealed, the increase in c/a ratio might be due to the favourable nucleation of PbTiO3 (PTO) phase at the TiO/PZT interface. The increase in \u03b1(100) value of PZT on LNO/TiO interface also evident this anomaly. These results further confirms that the TiO grown on LNO has low surface energy which promotes either (100) or (110) orientation of PZT film. shows the FESEM morphology of PZT films on different buffer layers. To examined further the average grain size distribution was measured using imageJ software and the extracted grain size were interpreted by Gaussian fit using origin software ( in SI). The histogram gaussian fit images is incorporated within FESEM images. The average grain size of PZT were as follows; 487, 200, 100 and 134 nm on Pt, TiO, LNO and LNO/TiO buffer layers respectively. This shows that the nucleation behaviour of PZT film is disparate in all the films. The smaller and uniform grain size indicates that there is a significant change in the interfacial energy on LNO buffer. From the FESEM images the thickness to grain size aspect ratio was examined and it implies the degree of columnar structure and the values are 1.54 (Pt), 4.5 (TiO), 9.1 (LNO) and 6.34 (LNO/TiO) ( in SI). The highest columnar structure on LNO buffer layer is attributed to decrease in misfit strain or internal energy due to lattice-matched interface. These findings support the highly textured (100) oriented PZT film on LNO buffer. These difference in the nucleation behaviour and the grain size distribution will have influence on the ferroelectric and dielectric properties of PZT films. a shows the polarization vs electric field hysteresis loops of PZT films on different buffer layers. All the films show strong ferroelectric switching characteristic with applied electric field. b shows the comparison bar chart representing the saturated polarization (P max ) and remanent polarization (P r ) values of PZT films on different buffer layers. The highest P max value is shown by bare Pt and lowest by LNO buffer. It is reported that the P max value is higher for (111) oriented and lower for (100) oriented PZT films agrees well with our results. Typically, the ferroelectric properties were evaluated from the obtained P r values and it is related to the distortion of the TiO6 octahedra from its Centro-of symmetry along the poling axis. Overall, the ferroelectric property is decided by the P r /P max ratio and it is found to be 0.25(Pt), 0.236(TiO), 0.193(LNO) and 0.446(LNO/TiO) respectively. Though the c/a ratio of bare Pt and Pt/LNO/TiO are similar, however the significant increase in P r /P max ratio of LNO/TiO buffer is uncertain. The low P r value implies the population of ferroelastic domains (non-180\xb0 domains) is higher in LNO buffer. d) illustrate the formation of ferroelectric (180\xb0) and ferroelastic (90\xb0) domains due to in-plane compressive stress on tetragonal structure. Theoretically, to minimize the elastic energy the long cT-axis of the tetragonal cell will split in to ferroelectric 180\xb0 and ferroelastic non-180\xb0 domains. Due to the high compressive stress induced by the LNO layer favours the formation of 90\xb0 domains (aT-axis) inorder to reduce the elastic along cT-axis. From the XRD analysis it is inferred that the decrease in a-lattice and decrease in c/a ratio might be associated with the formation of non-180\xb0 domains of PZT film on LNO buffer. In the case of LNO/TiO the higher P r /P max value is associated to higher c/a ratio and reduced misfit strain. Other possible reason behind the high P r /P max values is the formation of PTO (PbTiO3) interface, which might increase the ferroelectric phase on LNO/TiO interface. Moreover, the high relative intensity \u03b1 (100)value of LNO/TiO/PZT compared to TiO/PZT film confirms the formation of PTO phase. Thus the underlying LNO buffer layer plays a vital role in the formation of tetragonal ferroelectric phase on the hetero-structured interface. The insight plot at b shows the coercive field (E c ) of PZT film on different buffers and it is found to be lower in LNO (100 kV/cm) and highest for both bare Pt and Pt/LNO/TiO (\u223c130 kV/cm). It is recognized that the smaller grains, columnar structure reduces the domain wall clamping and facilitates the easy domain wall motion leads to low E c in LNO buffered PZT film. The discrepant in the high E c value of PZT on bare Pt and on LNO/TiO is quite distinguishable. It is well-understood that the higher E c value in LNO/TiO is associated with the high P r value. In the case of bare Pt/PZT, though the P r is low but it shows higher E c value. These might be associate to the interface defect-dipoles includes oxygen vacancies or trapped free carriers at the grain boundaries which pinned the domains in Pt/PZT film. These findings emphasizes that the hetero-structured LNO/TiO buffer is favour over other buffer layer to grow stable ferroelectric domains. To validate the quality of the film, leakage current measurement was carried out using DC bias of 20 V at room temperature (c). The high switching current peak (\u223c1700 \xb5A/cmE^{2}) is shown by Pt/PZT and the lowest (400 \xb5A/cmE^{2}) is shown by Pt/LNO/PZT film. The asymmetricity in the switching current and peak splitting indicates the domain wall pinning effect is obvious at the Pt/PZT interface. The symmetric and low leakage current replicates the decrease in domain wall pinning due to lattice matched LNO/PZT interface. It is also believed that the introduction of LNO buffer reduces the interfacial energy and act as an oxygen source during voltage cycling, which leads to increase in life span of the ferroelectric device. To confirm the reliability of the ferroelectric domains the polarization fatigue measurements was carried out on Pt/PZT and Pt/LNO/TiO/PZT films ( in SI) and it was found to be stable on hetero-structed PZT films. depicts the room temperature piezoelectric properties of PZT films on different buffered platinum substrates. The measurements were carried out using a Radian Ferroelectric Tester in conjunction with a single-beam laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) at a frequency of 10 Hz. To mitigate substrate deformation, the test samples were initially glued to a thick glass plate with a 100 mm diameter and 5 mm thickness before the measurements were conducted. It is understood that the error margin for the single beam laser interferometer is approximately 50\u201370 % of the obtained values. The measured piezoelectric coefficient (d33,f) values for the PZT films, adjusted to account for a 50 % error margin (considering the samples were bonded to a thick glass holder), are 80, 153, 156 and 260 pm/V for Pt, Pt/TiO, Pt/LNO and Pt/LNO/TiO respectively. From this observation, it is evident that the hetero-structured PZT film exhibits a higher d33,f value compared to other buffers and Pt substrates. Previous study has also reported that randomly oriented PZT films demonstrate piezoelectric coefficient values that are eight times higher than those with (111) orientation and twice as high as those with (100) orientation. XRD analysis confirms that the hetero-structured PZT film exhibits random orientation, and the suppression of (111) peak further supports the high d33,f value obtained in this study. To investigate the thermodynamic stability of ferroelectric domains, all the films were examined under elevated temperature range from 30 \xb0C to 180 \xb0C. (a-d) depicts the leakage current plot vs voltage of PZT films deposited on different buffered Pt substrate at elevated temperature. From a, it is seen that the leakage current increases at higher temperature (180\xb0 C) indicates the pinned domain gets relaxed at elevated temperature. It is also observed the leakage current increases at higher voltage at elevated temperature obeys the thermal activation mechanism in both Pt/PZT and Pt/TiO/PZT films. From c and d, it is observed that there were very less significant changes in the leakage current values of PZT films on LNO and LNO/TiO buffer. The low leakage current replicates the presence of stable ferroelectric domains in Pt/LNO/TiO/PZT film. This study further confirms the introduction of TiO on LNO buffers facilitates the growth of stable ferroelectric phase and considerably reduces the population of defective-dipoles at the interface on LNO/TiO/PZT interface. To support the above findings the temperature dependent P-E hysteresis loop measurements ( ) were carried out on all the PZT films. The polarization values are inconsistent for all the PZT films except on LNO/TiO buffer. This further confirms the presence of defective interface that gets migrated into the bulk contribute to higher leakage current as observed on Pt/PZT film. In the case of only TiO2 buffer the PZT film lost its ferroelectric character and device failure occurs at < 150 \xb0C, this suggest the only TiO buffer is not the suitable buffer to obtain stable interface on Pt substrate. In summary, the introduction of hetero-structure buffers considerable reduces the defective-dipoles at the ferroelectric/electrode interface and thus improves the thermal stability of the ferroelectric domains. shows the dielectric constant and tan delta loss factor with increasing in frequency of PZT films on different buffer layers. The obtained dielectric values at 1 kHz and 1 Vac are as follows: 842, 1029, 1065, 935 and dielectric loss are 0.264, 0.108, 0.087, 0.068 for Pt, Pt/TiO, Pt/LNO and Pt/LNO/TiO respectively. According to Maxwell-Wagner effect, if the dielectric constant is higher then the loss factor also should be higher but it is not so in buffered PZT films. From the above discussions the reason for high dielectric constant on LNO are as follows; it is associated to the presence of easy non-180\xb0 domains switching, smaller and uniform grain size distribution and reduced misfit strain at the interface. In the case of bare Pt/PZT film, the low dielectric constant is attributed to the domain wall pinning includes oxygen vacancies at the interface which impedes the reorientation of polarization. The obtained lower tangent loss behaviour is consistent with the lower leakage current of the LNO buffer PZT film. It is also observed from the plot that the tangent loss increases at higher frequency (i.e., \u223c100 kHz) of PZT film on the heterojunction interface. The increase in dielectric loss of PZT film on heterostructure is attributed to the formation of thin leaky capacitive layer at the film/oxide interface. The finite conductance at LNO/TiO interface increases at specific frequency, leading to increase in dielectric loss. However, this effect is not observed in conducting oxide buffer (Pt/LNO/PZT). The slop is constant in LNO buffer and it is much steeper in bare Pt/PZT film further confirms the presence of the mobile charge defect is constrained at the buffer interface. Thus, the LNO/TiO buffer layers play a major role in obtaining device quality ferroelectric films with low leakage current on Pt substrates.

# TITLE
Improving the thermal stability of 180<sup>Â°</sup> domain switching by engineering the ferroelectric/electrode interface

# ABSTRACT
In this investigation, we engineered the interface by employing lattice-matching buffer layers (TiO2, LaNiO3, and LaNiO3/TiO2) on a Pt substrate to reduce defects at the Pt/PZT interface. XRD and SEM studies reveal highly textured and columnar grain structures on the buffered PZT films. The hetero-structured LNO/TiO/PZT interface shows enhanced polarizability (Pr/Pmax) and reduced leakage current. The piezoelectric properties shows higher d33,f value for the hetero-structure buffer PZT film. Frequency-dependent dielectric studies reveal enhanced dielectric properties with a low loss factor, likely due to the reduction of defect-dipoles at the LNO/TiO buffer interface.

# INTRODUCTION
It is known that the ferroelectric materials, especially a well-established PbZrTiO3 (PZT) films which have the capability of sensing as well as harvesting energy from mechanical vibration is an added advantages for using this material in smart sensing applications. The recent advancement in nano-fabrication and miniaturization technology have brought evolution in the development of embedded ferroelectric MEMS devices within the microfluidic channels for earlier diseases diagnosing, tagging data-over sounds, advanced piezo-MEMS speakers etc.. Several studies have been carried out for the past two decades to improve the electrical fatigue properties of PZT films. It is well-established from the previous work that the PZT film shows the decrease in polarization value due to fatigue beyond 10E^{6} cycles. Comprehensive studies on the leakage current and ferroelectric switching behaviour have been implemented on PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 (PZT) films with different buffer interface. For the PZT films, TiO2 (TiO), LaNiO3 (LNO) and LaNiO3/TiO2 (LNO/TiO) combination is selected as interfacial buffer candidates and explored how these buffer layers influence the defect-dipoles formation by analysing the ferroelectricity and leakage current behaviour at elevated temperatures.

# CONCLUSION
In summary, we have successfully grown PZT films on different buffers (TiO, LNO and LNO/TiO) and studied its functional properties. The XRD and FESEM analysis reveals the increase in tetragonality factor (c/a ratio) and columnar grain structure in LNO buffered PZT films. The ferroelectric properties reveal high P r /P max ratio with low leakage current in LNO/TiO/PZT film. The comprehensive studies on temperature dependent ferroelectric and leakage current shows considerable decrease in interface defects and it shows thermodynamically stable ferroelectric domains on Pt/LNO/TiO/PZT film. Thus, with this studies it is explored that the degradation mechanism in ferroelectric properties is associated to domain pinning due to oxygen vacancies at Pt/PZT interface. The increase in dielectric constant and decrease in loss factor on Pt/LNO/TiO/PZT stack is another remarkable achievement of this present work. The measured piezocoefficient values on this buffered PZT films shows higher at the hetero-structured buffer.
