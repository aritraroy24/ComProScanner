Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'Solid-state reaction', 'precursors': [], 'steps': ['Raw materials prepared according to calculated ratios', 'Planetary ball mill for 4 hours', 'Slurry dried at 100 ℃', 'Calcined at 850 ℃ for 2 hours', '7 wt.% of binder (polyvinyl alcohol) added to dried slurry', 'Powder well grounded', 'Powder pressed into 10 mm diameter discs', 'Calcined at 1100 °C for 2 hours'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'SEM', 'XPS', 'DC resistivity measurement', 'LCR analyzer', 'Quasi-static d33 meter']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
