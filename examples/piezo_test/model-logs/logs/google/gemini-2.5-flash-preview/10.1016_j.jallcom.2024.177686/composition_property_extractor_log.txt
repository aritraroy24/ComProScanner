# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of xTa-Sm-PZT ceramics are shown in. (b) and (c) show the diffraction peak splitting of (001)/(100) and (002)/(200), which is typical of tetragonal phase. Changes in the phase structure occurred for samples with different Ta-doping amounts, as seen from the changes in the shapes of the (001)/(100) and (002)/(200) diffraction peaks in (b) and (c), as indicated by the change in the relative content fraction of the T phase as shown in (e), which reaches a maximum at x = 0.01. shows the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the fracture surfaces of the as-sintered ceramics with different Ta doping amounts. Compared with other samples, the grain size of the sample with x = 0.01 is much smaller. With further increasing Ta doping amount, the cation vacancy concentration also further increases, which promotes mass transportation during the sintering process, gradually increasing grain size. (a)\u2013(d) display the curves of temperature-dependent dielectric permittivity (\u03b5 r) for xTa-Sm-PZT. As shown in (e), the TaE^{5+}-ion doping concentration has little effect on the Curie temperature (T C) of xTa-Sm-PZT ceramics, with the T C values fluctuating between 343 \xb0C and 363 \xb0C. (f) shows the variation of the dielectric permittivity (\u03b5 r) and loss (tan\u03b4) of the ceramic samples with the TaE^{5+}-ion doping content. As the TaE^{5+}-ion amount increases from 0 to 0.01, the dielectric permittivity increases from 1491 to 1788, while the dielectric loss decreases from 0.017 to 0.015 [(f)]. TaE^{5+}-ion doping in PZT ceramics helps to enhance the dielectric permittivity and reduce the dielectric loss, indicating the characteristics of soft doping. The dispersion of a relaxing ferroelectric can be studied using a modified Curie-Weiss law, which is given as : where \u03b5 max denotes the maximum value of the dielectric permittivity, \u03b5 r denotes the dielectric permittivity at a temperature of T, T max denotes the temperature at the \u03b5 r peak and \u03b3 denotes the diffuseness degree. (g) demonstrates the plots of ln(1/\u03b5 r\u20131/\u03b5 max) vs ln(T\u2013T max) based on curves of temperature-dependent dielectric permittivity. As shown in (h), the \u03b3 value exhibits the dispersion degree of ferroelectric relaxors. The \u03b3 value of ceramic specimens without Ta-ion doping is 1.67, and the \u03b3 values of ceramic samples doped with TaE^{5+} ions of 0.01, 0.02, and 0.03 have been significantly enhanced to 1.77, 1.76, and 1.80, respectively. The closer the \u03b3 value is to 1, the weaker the relaxation properties of the piezoceramics are, and the closer they are to normal ferroelectrics. The closer the \u03b3 value is to 2, the stronger the relaxation properties of the piezoceramics. This indicates that xTa-Sm-PZT ceramics are typical relaxor ferroelectrics, and the TaE^{5+}-ion doping enhances the dielectric relaxation. (a)\u2013(d) show the temperature dependence of the reciprocal of the \u03b5 r for xTa-Sm-PZT ceramic specimens. When T > T C, the Curie-Weiss law is applied to describe the \u03b5 r of normal ferroelectric materials and the Curie-Weiss law is given as : where C represents the Curie-Weiss constant, which reflects the nature of ferroelectric transition, and T 0 represents the Curie-Weiss temperature. The C values of magnitude 10E^{5}, as shown in (f), can be obtained from the slope of the fitted line in (a)\u2013(d), suggesting that xTa-Sm-PZT ceramics are displacive-type ferroelectrics. The \u03b5 r values significantly deviate from the Curie-Weiss law above T C [(e)], and the deviation degree \u2206T is defined as : where T cw is the temperature at which \u03b5 r begins to comply with Equation (2) and T m represents the temperature corresponding to the \u03b5 r peak. The \u2206T value for the ceramic without Ta-ion doping is 22 \xb0C, while the \u2206T value for the ceramic doped with 0.01Ta increases to 40.8 \xb0C, as shown in (e). The deviation degree \u2206T is closely related to the relaxation behavior of the piezoceramics. This implies that the TaE^{5+}-ion doping improves the local structural inhomogeneity and increases the piezoelectric properties. Considering that the radii of TaE^{5+} and SmE^{3+} ions are 0.64 \xc5 and 0.958 \xc5, respectively, while the radii of ZrE^{4+} and TiE^{4+} B-site ions are 0.72 \xc5 and 0.605 \xc5, respectively. The A-site PbE^{2+}-ion radius is 1.19 \xc5, SmE^{3+} ions are preferred to enter the A site and replace the PbE^{2+} ions in the A site, and TaE^{5+} ions are preferred to enter the B site and replace the TiE^{4+}/ZrE^{4+} ions at the B site. The SmE^{3+} ions doped as an A-site donor, due to their charge neutrality, generate Pb vacancies, leading to a decrease in the concentration of oxygen vacancies , as illustrated by the defect chemistry. TaE^{5+}-ion doping as a B-site donor, due to charge neutrality, generates A-site Pb vacancies, B-site Ti or Zr vacancies, and lattice oxygen, leading to a decrease in the concentration of oxygen vacancies, as explained by the vacancy reaction. There is no signal of the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra in the 2.0\u20132.1 g range, indicating a low oxygen vacancy concentration. As shown in (a)\u2013(c), the cationic vacancies (B-site Ti or Zr and A-site Pb) associated with defect dipoles (Ta Zr,Ti \u2022\u2013 V Pb \u2032\u2032,Ta Zr,Ti \u2022\u2013 V Zr,Ti \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032, Sm Pb \u2022\u2013 V Pb \u2032\u2032) cause low amplitude lattice relaxation in the adjacent atomic layers and enhance the dielectric relaxation. As shown in (d)\u2013(g), O 1s X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) high-resolution spectra of xTa-Sm-PZT ceramics indicate that the cationic vacancies (B-site Ti or Zr and A-site Pb) lead to a decrease in the oxygen vacancy concentration. As shown in the defect chemistry on doping produces oxygen vacancies, shown as typical hard doping, whereas TaE^{5+}-ion doping reduces the oxygen vacancy concentration, shown as typical soft doping. Soft doping is an effective way to enhance the piezoelectricity of ABO3-type piezoceramics. Ferroelectric materials have spontaneous polarization (P s) and there are two or more possible orientations for the P s, which can be varied under the action of an electric field, manifested by having a hysteresis loop. (a) displays the hysteresis polarization (P)\u2013electric field (E) loops of xTa-Sm-PZT ceramics, the loops of the ceramic samples all exhibit a high degree of symmetry and saturation without significant leakage currents, and these P\u2013E loops dominate the saturation by the complete polarization reversal process of the ferroelectric domains. The ceramic samples without Ta-ion doping have a remnant polarization (P r) of 21.1 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} [(b)]. The P r of the ceramic samples doped with 0.01 Ta-ions increases to 25.5 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} and decreases gradually with increasing Ta-ion doping content (x). The coercive field (E c) increases with increasing the Ta-ion doping content from 0.00 to 0.002 and decreases at 0.03. A moderate amount of doped TaE^{5+} ions into the B-site produces a moderate amount of defect dipoles (Ta Zr,Ti \u2022\u2013 V Pb \u2032\u2032,Ta Zr,Ti \u2022\u2013 V Zr,Ti \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032, Sm Pb \u2022\u2013 V Pb \u2032\u2032) as shown in the defect chemistry. The diminution in oxygen vacancy concentration due to cationic vacancies (V Zr,Ti \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 or V Pb \u2032\u2032) reduces the internal stresses between the domains switched with the electric field, resulting in fewer domains rotating after removal of the electric field and thus an increase in the P r. However, the entry of excessively doped TaE^{5+} ions into the B-site generates too many defect dipoles, which produces a pinning effect on the domain rotation, thus decreasing the P r and increasing the E c. Doping with TaE^{5+} ions leads to lattice distortion, while the B-site ions deviate from the center of the unit cell and the production of defect dipoles (Ta Zr,Ti \u2022\u2013 V Pb \u2032\u2032,Ta Zr,Ti \u2022\u2013 V Zr,Ti \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032, Sm Pb \u2022\u2013 V Pb \u2032\u2032) as shown in the defect chemistry. The defect dipole moment becomes larger and the ion mobility of the crystal structure becomes higher under an applied electric field, which promotes domain rotation and thus improves the piezoelectric properties of xTa-Sm-PZT ceramics. The d 33 and k p of 0.01Ta-Sm-PZT ceramic samples reach their maximum values and gradually decrease with increasing Ta-ion doping amount [(c)]. This is because excessive doping of TaE^{5+} ions leads to the creation of too many defect dipoles, which can produce a pinning effect that increases the internal stresses between the domains switched with the electric field, leading to more domain rotation upon removal of the electric field, thus reducing the piezoelectric response. The piezoelectric coefficient d 33 can be related to the \u03b5 r and the P r, and their relationship is given in the equation : where Q 33 is the electrostrictive coefficient and the d 33 is proportional to \u03b5 r\xb7 P r in terms of. The d 33 and the \u03b5 r\xb7 P r curves in (d) have the same trend. (a) shows the temperature-dependent quasi-static d 33 obtained from in situ measurements as the temperature slowly increases from room temperature to 450\xb0C. (b) shows the variation rate of d 33 (\u2206d 33%) of xTa-Sm-PZT ceramics. The change rate of d 33 (\u2206d 33%) is given as: where \u2206d 33@T is the change rate of d 33 at a temperature T, d 33@T is the d 33 at the temperature T, and d 33@RT is the d 33 at room temperature. The inset in (b) shows the \u2206d 33% within 25\u2013257 \xb0C, the values of the d 33 change rate of \xb12 % and \xb15 % marked by the red and black horizontal lines, respectively. The d 33 of 0.01Ta-Sm-PZT ceramic sample varies only 2.2 % in the 25\u2013200 \xb0C temperature range. The d 33 of 0.00Ta-Sm-PZT ceramic sample varies only 4.6 % in the 25\u2013257 \xb0C temperature range. The temperature stability of the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 of the ceramics is reflected in the microstructure as the crystal and domain structures remain stable within a certain temperature range. This temperature stability of the microstructure can be closely related to the effect of the defect dipoles (Ta Zr,Ti \u2022\u2013 V Pb \u2032\u2032,Ta Zr,Ti \u2022\u2013 V Zr,Ti \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032, Sm Pb \u2022\u2013 V Pb \u2032\u2032). As shown in (b), the samples with Ta-ion doping concentrations of 0.00 and 0.01 have excellent temperature stability of the piezoelectric constant d 33. The samples doped with further increased concentrations have deteriorative temperature stability of the piezoelectric constant d 33, which is in accordance with our previous work. Excessive Ta ion doping concentration produces too many dipoles, and the dipole moment and direction of these dipoles are sensitive to temperature, resulting in poor temperature stability of the piezoelectric coefficient d 33. (a) displays the temperature-dependent Raman spectra of 0.01Ta-Sm-PZT ceramic sample. At first glance, the Raman spectra show little variation over 25\u2013320 \xb0C. To reveal the temperature stability of the phase structure, the focus is on the \u03c52 modes indicating the presence of the R and T phases , where the \u03c51 modes indicate the O-B-O bending vibrations of the tetragonal phase. The peak position and intensity of the \u03c52 mode do not vary significantly as the temperature increases from room temperature to 320 \xb0C [(a)]. The Raman spectra in the 160\u2013315 cmE^{\u22121} range are fitted utilizing the Lorentz function to examine the variation of the peak positions of the \u03c52 mode with temperature [(b)]. The change of \u03c52 mode with temperature is summarized in (c). The peak positions of \u03c52 mode show little variation over the 25\u2013320 \xb0C temperature range, indicating the stable phase structure. To understand the temperature stability of the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 of the sample, the variation of the crystal structure with temperature needs to be investigated, we heated 0.01Ta-Sm-PZT ceramic sample from 25 \xb0C to 370 \xb0C and scanned the XRD patterns in situ at ten temperature points (25, 50, 90, 130, 170, 200, 257, 290, 330, and 370 \xb0C), and did the Rietveld refinements with Maud software to obtain the lattice parameters and bond lengths and bond angles. The generator voltage and X-ray tube currents are 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively, the Cu K\u03b11 wavelength is 1.540598 \xc5, the fixed divergence slit is 0.38 mm wide, the step size of the scan is 0.01313\xb0, and the time per step is 23.97 s. The value ranges of the R w (%) and Sig error factors for the Rietveld refinements are [1.37, 1.41] and [4.89, 5.51], respectively, which satisfy the conditions of R w\u226410 % and Sig\u22642, which indicates that the results of the Rietveld refinements are reliable. (a) and (b) show the XRD patterns of 0.01Ta-Sm-PZT ceramic sample scanned at ten temperature points from 25\u2013370 \xb0C in the 2\u03b8 range of 15\u201390\xb0 and 43\u201345.5\xb0, respectively. The XRD patterns in the 43\u201345.5\xb0 2\u03b8 range shown in (b) are represented as a color-filled contour/heat map in (c). The sample has coexisting R and T phases, as unit cells of the R and T phases illustrated in (d), and the Curie temperature of the sample is 343 \xb0C. As demonstrated in (b), especially as illustrated in (c), the (002) and (200) split diffraction peaks of the T phase gradually approach each other with increasing temperature, and finally merge into a single diffraction peak of the cubic paraelectric phase at 370 \xb0C. We performed Rietveld refinements on the XRD patterns scanned at ten temperature points, of which the Rietveld refinements at 25 \xb0C and 200 \xb0C are shown in (e) and (f), respectively. As the temperature increases, the B-O and A-O bond lengths of the R phase exhibit roughly opposite trends, nevertheless the\u2220B-O-A bond angle shows an overall decreasing trend [(j)]. With the increase of temperature, the cell volume V and the lattice parameter a of the R phase have the same trend, nevertheless, the lattice parameter \u03b1 angle changes little in the 25\u2013200 \xb0C temperature range and changes drastically after exceeding 200 \xb0C, which suggests that the temperature stability of the piezoelectric constant of the PZT sample originates from the temperature stability of the lattice parameter \u03b1 of the R phase [(h)]. As the temperature increases, the B-O1A and B-O1B bond lengths of the tetragonal lattice have opposite trends, while the B-O2A bond length changes very little. Moreover, the \u2220B-O2A-B bond angle changes little in the 25\u2013200 \xb0C temperature range and changes drastically after exceeding 200 \xb0C, which suggests that the temperature stability of piezoelectricity of the PZT sample originates from the temperature stability of the \u2220B-O2A-B bond angle of the T phase [(i)]. In addition, the \u2220B-O2A-B bond angle and \u2220O2A-B-O2 C bond angle of the T phase are equal during the heating process. Overall, the temperature stability of piezoelectricity of the PZT sample (the d 33 varies only 2.2 % in the 25\u2013200 \xb0C range) derives from the temperature stability of the \u2220B-O2A-B/\u2220O2A-B-O2 C bond angles of the T phase and the lattice parameter \u03b1 of the R phase. To deeply understand the mechanism of piezoelectricity from the domain structure, the domain morphology and local piezoelectric response were observed using PFM ( ) to scan the surface of 0.01Ta-Sm-PZT ceramic over an area of 4\xd74 \u03bcmE^{2}. The widths of the bright yellow and dark blue striped domains are in the 107\u2212150 nm and 57\u221275 nm ranges, respectively. The nanodomain structure in the PZT sample favours its high piezoelectricity. (e) shows schematic illustrations of defect dipoles in domains gradually turning under the action of an electric field. The defect dipoles rotate to the direction of an increased electric field, which elucidates that the high piezoelectric properties of the PZT sample originate from the electric-field-driven poling rotation [(e)]. The local poling (litho mode) treatment is utilized to observe the domain switching with the applied voltage (10, 20, 30, and 40 V) [(c)]. Domain switching is realized in the regions of 10, 20, 30, and 40 V, which means that the domains in the sample are easy to rotate. The easier the domains are to rotate, the higher the piezoelectricity of the piezoceramic. (d) shows the local domain switching of the unpoled sample observed by switching spectroscopy piezoresponse force microscopy (SS-PFM) with the 4\xd74 \u03bcm area scanned by applying a voltage of 15 V. The butterfly-shaped loop of amplitude and the hysteresis-like loop of phase in (d) are offset by +3.1 V from their centers. The left and right wings of the butterfly-shaped loop are asymmetrically shaped, where the amplitude values of the highest points in the positive and negative voltage directions are 608 pm and 844 pm, respectively.

                     33 by doping heterovalent ions in the PbZr0.54Ti0.46O3 ceramics at the A/B sites in the ABO3 lattice. The Sm3+-ion amount at the A-site remains constant, while the Ta5+-ion amount at the B-site changes. We utilized electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to investigate the reduction of oxygen vacancies, which are closely associated with the defect dipoles formed by heterovalent doping. We utilized piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction (XRD) combined with Rietveld refinement, and temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy to understand the mechanism of the temperature stability of the piezoelectric coefficient d

# INTRODUCTION
The conversion of mechanical energy and electrical energy can be realized by piezoelectric ceramics, and lead zirconate titanate (PZT)-based piezoceramics have been extensively used in civilian and military fields such as sensors, ultrasonic transducers, microdisplacement devices, and other electronic components. In light of the brisk evolution in IoT and AI technologies, there's a critical demand for cutting-edge electronics that rely on piezoelectric materials. Such materials should boast high values of the piezoelectric constant d 33, considerable electromechanical coupling coefficients k p, and dependable performance over a wide temperature range. In recent years, the study of heterovalent-ion doping at the A/B site of the ABO3 lattice of lead-based piezoelectric ceramics has been developed. Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 (PMN-PT) piezoceramics doped with A-site SmE^{3+}-ions have an ultrahigh d 33 of 1500 pC/N. High piezoelectric activity (d 33 = 680 pC/N and T C = 269 \xb0C) was achieved in A-site LiE^{+}-ion doped Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O3-Pb(Ni1/3Nb2/3)O3-Pb(Zr0.46Ti0.54)O3 (PNN-PZN-PZT) piezoceramics. High piezoelectric activity (d 33 = 563 pC/N and T C = 301 \xb0C) was obtained in Pb(Zr0.5Ti0.5)O3-Pb(Mg0.5W0.5)O3-Pb(Ni1/3Nb2/3)O3 (PZT-PMW-PNN) ceramics by doping B-site YbE^{3+} ions. High piezoelectric activity (d 33 = 640 pC/N and T C = 303 \xb0C) was achieved in Pb(Zr0.5Ti0.5)O3-Pb(Mg0.5W0.5)O3-Pb(Ni1/3Nb2/3)O3 (PZT-PMW-PNN) ceramics by doping B-site TaE^{5+} ions. High piezoelectric activity (d 33 = 864 pC/N and T C = 201 \xb0C) was achieved in PZT ceramics by doping B-site NbE^{5+} ions. The variation rate of the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 of PZT ceramics in the room temperature range to about 160 \xb0C can currently be as low as about 10 %. Further improvement of the temperature stability of the d 33 is an urgent problem for PZT ceramics. Our previous work has shown that PZT piezoceramics doped with A-site NdE^{3+} ions have excellent temperature stability of the piezoelectric coefficient d 33, with a d 33 change of only 3.6 % from 30 to 260 \xb0C. Studies on the temperature stability of the piezoelectric constant d 33 of piezoelectric ceramics are gradually emerging by in situ testing d 33 with temperature. and summarize some of the relevant data from the literature. In this work, we doped the A-site of the ABO3 lattice of PbZr0.54Ti0.46O3 ceramics with 0.01 SmE^{3+} ions and the B-site with different concentrations of TaE^{5+} ions to enhance the piezoelectric properties, in particular the piezoelectric temperature stability. We achieved an ultrahigh temperature stability of the piezoelectric constant d 33. The d 33 varies only 2.2 % over the 25\u2013200 \xb0C temperature range.

# CONCLUSION
The piezoelectric coefficient of piezoelectric ceramics has an ultrahigh temperature stability over a broad temperature range, which is extremely important for piezoelectric devices and sensors operating over a wide temperature range. 0.01Ta-Sm-PZT ceramic samples have a d 33 variation of only 2.2 % in the 25\u2013200 \xb0C range. 0.00Ta-Sm-PZT ceramic samples have a d 33 variation of only 4.3 % in the 25\u2013200 \xb0C range and 4.6 % in the 25\u2013257 \xb0C range. The ultrahigh temperature stability of the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 of the PZT piezoceramics arises from the stable phase structure (coexistence of tetragonal and rhombohedral phases) and the stable domain structure (large-size domains of a few micrometers), and in particular from the stable crystal structures (stabilized bond angles \u2220B-O2A-B/\u2220O2A-B-O2C of the tetragonal lattices and \u03b1 angles of the rhombohedral lattices).

**Notes**:

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of xTa-Sm-PZT ceramics are shown in. (b) and (c) show the diffraction peak splitting of (001)/(100) and (002)/(200), which is typical of tetragonal phase. Changes in the phase structure occurred for samples with different Ta-doping amounts, as seen from the changes in the shapes of the (001)/(100) and (002)/(200) diffraction peaks in (b) and (c), as indicated by the change in the relative content fraction of the T phase as shown in (e), which reaches a maximum at x = 0.01. shows the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the fracture surfaces of the as-sintered ceramics with different Ta doping amounts. Compared with other samples, the grain size of the sample with x = 0.01 is much smaller. With further increasing Ta doping amount, the cation vacancy concentration also further increases, which promotes mass transportation during the sintering process, gradually increasing grain size. (a)\u2013(d) display the curves of temperature-dependent dielectric permittivity (\u03b5 r) for xTa-Sm-PZT. As shown in (e), the TaE^{5+}-ion doping concentration has little effect on the Curie temperature (T C) of xTa-Sm-PZT ceramics, with the T C values fluctuating between 343 \xb0C and 363 \xb0C. (f) shows the variation of the dielectric permittivity (\u03b5 r) and loss (tan\u03b4) of the ceramic samples with the TaE^{5+}-ion doping content. As the TaE^{5+}-ion amount increases from 0 to 0.01, the dielectric permittivity increases from 1491 to 1788, while the dielectric loss decreases from 0.017 to 0.015 [(f)]. TaE^{5+}-ion doping in PZT ceramics helps to enhance the dielectric permittivity and reduce the dielectric loss, indicating the characteristics of soft doping. The dispersion of a relaxing ferroelectric can be studied using a modified Curie-Weiss law, which is given as : where \u03b5 max denotes the maximum value of the dielectric permittivity, \u03b5 r denotes the dielectric permittivity at a temperature of T, T max denotes the temperature at the \u03b5 r peak and \u03b3 denotes the diffuseness degree. (g) demonstrates the plots of ln(1/\u03b5 r\u20131/\u03b5 max) vs ln(T\u2013T max) based on curves of temperature-dependent dielectric permittivity. As shown in (h), the \u03b3 value exhibits the dispersion degree of ferroelectric relaxors. The \u03b3 value of ceramic specimens without Ta-ion doping is 1.67, and the \u03b3 values of ceramic samples doped with TaE^{5+} ions of 0.01, 0.02, and 0.03 have been significantly enhanced to 1.77, 1.76, and 1.80, respectively. The closer the \u03b3 value is to 1, the weaker the relaxation properties of the piezoceramics are, and the closer they are to normal ferroelectrics. The closer the \u03b3 value is to 2, the stronger the relaxation properties of the piezoceramics. This indicates that xTa-Sm-PZT ceramics are typical relaxor ferroelectrics, and the TaE^{5+}-ion doping enhances the dielectric relaxation. (a)\u2013(d) show the temperature dependence of the reciprocal of the \u03b5 r for xTa-Sm-PZT ceramic specimens. When T > T C, the Curie-Weiss law is applied to describe the \u03b5 r of normal ferroelectric materials and the Curie-Weiss law is given as : where C represents the Curie-Weiss constant, which reflects the nature of ferroelectric transition, and T 0 represents the Curie-Weiss temperature. The C values of magnitude 10E^{5}, as shown in (f), can be obtained from the slope of the fitted line in (a)\u2013(d), suggesting that xTa-Sm-PZT ceramics are displacive-type ferroelectrics. The \u03b5 r values significantly deviate from the Curie-Weiss law above T C [(e)], and the deviation degree \u2206T is defined as : where T cw is the temperature at which \u03b5 r begins to comply with Equation (2) and T m represents the temperature corresponding to the \u03b5 r peak. The \u2206T value for the ceramic without Ta-ion doping is 22 \xb0C, while the \u2206T value for the ceramic doped with 0.01Ta increases to 40.8 \xb0C, as shown in (e). The deviation degree \u2206T is closely related to the relaxation behavior of the piezoceramics. This implies that the TaE^{5+}-ion doping improves the local structural inhomogeneity and increases the piezoelectric properties. Considering that the radii of TaE^{5+} and SmE^{3+} ions are 0.64 \xc5 and 0.958 \xc5, respectively, while the radii of ZrE^{4+} and TiE^{4+} B-site ions are 0.72 \xc5 and 0.605 \xc5, respectively. The A-site PbE^{2+}-ion radius is 1.19 \xc5, SmE^{3+} ions are preferred to enter the A site and replace the PbE^{2+} ions in the A site, and TaE^{5+} ions are preferred to enter the B site and replace the TiE^{4+}/ZrE^{4+} ions at the B site. The SmE^{3+} ions doped as an A-site donor, due to their charge neutrality, generate Pb vacancies, leading to a decrease in the concentration of oxygen vacancies , as illustrated by the defect chemistry. TaE^{5+}-ion doping as a B-site donor, due to charge neutrality, generates A-site Pb vacancies, B-site Ti or Zr vacancies, and lattice oxygen, leading to a decrease in the concentration of oxygen vacancies, as explained by the vacancy reaction. There is no signal of the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra in the 2.0\u20132.1 g range, indicating a low oxygen vacancy concentration. As shown in (a)\u2013(c), the cationic vacancies (B-site Ti or Zr and A-site Pb) associated with defect dipoles (Ta Zr,Ti \u2022\u2013 V Pb \u2032\u2032,Ta Zr,Ti \u2022\u2013 V Zr,Ti \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032, Sm Pb \u2022\u2013 V Pb \u2032\u2032) cause low amplitude lattice relaxation in the adjacent atomic layers and enhance the dielectric relaxation. As shown in (d)\u2013(g), O 1s X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) high-resolution spectra of xTa-Sm-PZT ceramics indicate that the cationic vacancies (B-site Ti or Zr and A-site Pb) lead to a decrease in the oxygen vacancy concentration. As shown in the defect chemistry on doping produces oxygen vacancies, shown as typical hard doping, whereas TaE^{5+}-ion doping reduces the oxygen vacancy concentration, shown as typical soft doping. Soft doping is an effective way to enhance the piezoelectricity of ABO3-type piezoceramics. Ferroelectric materials have spontaneous polarization (P s) and there are two or more possible orientations for the P s, which can be varied under the action of an electric field, manifested by having a hysteresis loop. (a) displays the hysteresis polarization (P)\u2013electric field (E) loops of xTa-Sm-PZT ceramics, the loops of the ceramic samples all exhibit a high degree of symmetry and saturation without significant leakage currents, and these P\u2013E loops dominate the saturation by the complete polarization reversal process of the ferroelectric domains. The ceramic samples without Ta-ion doping have a remnant polarization (P r) of 21.1 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} [(b)]. The P r of the ceramic samples doped with 0.01 Ta-ions increases to 25.5 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} and decreases gradually with increasing Ta-ion doping content (x). The coercive field (E c) increases with increasing the Ta-ion doping content from 0.00 to 0.002 and decreases at 0.03. A moderate amount of doped TaE^{5+} ions into the B-site produces a moderate amount of defect dipoles (Ta Zr,Ti \u2022\u2013 V Pb \u2032\u2032,Ta Zr,Ti \u2022\u2013 V Zr,Ti \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032, Sm Pb \u2022\u2013 V Pb \u2032\u2032) as shown in the defect chemistry. The diminution in oxygen vacancy concentration due to cationic vacancies (V Zr,Ti \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 or V Pb \u2032\u2032) reduces the internal stresses between the domains switched with the electric field, resulting in fewer domains rotating after removal of the electric field and thus an increase in the P r. However, the entry of excessively doped TaE^{5+} ions into the B-site generates too many defect dipoles, which produces a pinning effect on the domain rotation, thus decreasing the P r and increasing the E c. Doping with TaE^{5+} ions leads to lattice distortion, while the B-site ions deviate from the center of the unit cell and the production of defect dipoles (Ta Zr,Ti \u2022\u2013 V Pb \u2032\u2032,Ta Zr,Ti \u2022\u2013 V Zr,Ti \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032, Sm Pb \u2022\u2013 V Pb \u2032\u2032) as shown in the defect chemistry. The defect dipole moment becomes larger and the ion mobility of the crystal structure becomes higher under an applied electric field, which promotes domain rotation and thus improves the piezoelectric properties of xTa-Sm-PZT ceramics. The d 33 and k p of 0.01Ta-Sm-PZT ceramic samples reach their maximum values and gradually decrease with increasing Ta-ion doping amount [(c)]. This is because excessive doping of TaE^{5+} ions leads to the creation of too many defect dipoles, which can produce a pinning effect that increases the internal stresses between the domains switched with the electric field, leading to more domain rotation upon removal of the electric field, thus reducing the piezoelectric response. The piezoelectric coefficient d 33 can be related to the \u03b5 r and the P r, and their relationship is given in the equation : where Q 33 is the electrostrictive coefficient and the d 33 is proportional to \u03b5 r\xb7 P r in terms of. The d 33 and the \u03b5 r\xb7 P r curves in (d) have the same trend. (a) shows the temperature-dependent quasi-static d 33 obtained from in situ measurements as the temperature slowly increases from room temperature to 450\xb0C. (b) shows the variation rate of d 33 (\u2206d 33%) of xTa-Sm-PZT ceramics. The change rate of d 33 (\u2206d 33%) is given as: where \u2206d 33@T is the change rate of d 33 at a temperature T, d 33@T is the d 33 at the temperature T, and d 33@RT is the d 33 at room temperature. The inset in (b) shows the \u2206d 33% within 25\u2013257 \xb0C, the values of the d 33 change rate of \xb12 % and \xb15 % marked by the red and black horizontal lines, respectively. The d 33 of 0.01Ta-Sm-PZT ceramic sample varies only 2.2 % in the 25\u2013200 \xb0C temperature range. The d 33 of 0.00Ta-Sm-PZT ceramic sample varies only 4.6 % in the 25\u2013257 \xb0C temperature range. The temperature stability of the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 of the ceramics is reflected in the microstructure as the crystal and domain structures remain stable within a certain temperature range. This temperature stability of the microstructure can be closely related to the effect of the defect dipoles (Ta Zr,Ti \u2022\u2013 V Pb \u2032\u2032,Ta Zr,Ti \u2022\u2013 V Zr,Ti \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032, Sm Pb \u2022\u2013 V Pb \u2032\u2032). As shown in (b), the samples with Ta-ion doping concentrations of 0.00 and 0.01 have excellent temperature stability of the piezoelectric constant d 33. The samples doped with further increased concentrations have deteriorative temperature stability of the piezoelectric constant d 33, which is in accordance with our previous work. Excessive Ta ion doping concentration produces too many dipoles, and the dipole moment and direction of these dipoles are sensitive to temperature, resulting in poor temperature stability of the piezoelectric coefficient d 33. (a) displays the temperature-dependent Raman spectra of 0.01Ta-Sm-PZT ceramic sample. At first glance, the Raman spectra show little variation over 25\u2013320 \xb0C. To reveal the temperature stability of the phase structure, the focus is on the \u03c52 modes indicating the presence of the R and T phases , where the \u03c51 modes indicate the O-B-O bending vibrations of the tetragonal phase. The peak position and intensity of the \u03c52 mode do not vary significantly as the temperature increases from room temperature to 320 \xb0C [(a)]. The Raman spectra in the 160\u2013315 cmE^{\u22121} range are fitted utilizing the Lorentz function to examine the variation of the peak positions of the \u03c52 mode with temperature [(b)]. The change of \u03c52 mode with temperature is summarized in (c). The peak positions of \u03c52 mode show little variation over the 25\u2013320 \xb0C temperature range, indicating the stable phase structure. To understand the temperature stability of the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 of the sample, the variation of the crystal structure with temperature needs to be investigated, we heated 0.01Ta-Sm-PZT ceramic sample from 25 \xb0C to 370 \xb0C and scanned the XRD patterns in situ at ten temperature points (25, 50, 90, 130, 170, 200, 257, 290, 330, and 370 \xb0C), and did the Rietveld refinements with Maud software to obtain the lattice parameters and bond lengths and bond angles. The generator voltage and X-ray tube currents are 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively, the Cu K\u03b11 wavelength is 1.540598 \xc5, the fixed divergence slit is 0.38 mm wide, the step size of the scan is 0.01313\xb0, and the time per step is 23.97 s. The value ranges of the R w (%) and Sig error factors for the Rietveld refinements are [1.37, 1.41] and [4.89, 5.51], respectively, which satisfy the conditions of R w\u226410 % and Sig\u22642, which indicates that the results of the Rietveld refinements are reliable. (a) and (b) show the XRD patterns of 0.01Ta-Sm-PZT ceramic sample scanned at ten temperature points from 25\u2013370 \xb0C in the 2\u03b8 range of 15\u201390\xb0 and 43\u201345.5\xb0, respectively. The XRD patterns in the 43\u201345.5\xb0 2\u03b8 range shown in (b) are represented as a color-filled contour/heat map in (c). The sample has coexisting R and T phases, as unit cells of the R and T phases illustrated in (d), and the Curie temperature of the sample is 343 \xb0C. As demonstrated in (b), especially as illustrated in (c), the (002) and (200) split diffraction peaks of the T phase gradually approach each other with increasing temperature, and finally merge into a single diffraction peak of the cubic paraelectric phase at 370 \xb0C. We performed Rietveld refinements on the XRD patterns scanned at ten temperature points, of which the Rietveld refinements at 25 \xb0C and 200 \xb0C are shown in (e) and (f), respectively. As the temperature increases, the B-O and A-O bond lengths of the R phase exhibit roughly opposite trends, nevertheless the\u2220B-O-A bond angle shows an overall decreasing trend [(j)]. With the increase of temperature, the cell volume V and the lattice parameter a of the R phase have the same trend, nevertheless, the lattice parameter \u03b1 angle changes little in the 25\u2013200 \xb0C temperature range and changes drastically after exceeding 200 \xb0C, which suggests that the temperature stability of the piezoelectric constant of the PZT sample originates from the temperature stability of the lattice parameter \u03b1 of the R phase [(h)]. As the temperature increases, the B-O1A and B-O1B bond lengths of the tetragonal lattice have opposite trends, while the B-O2A bond length changes very little. Moreover, the \u2220B-O2A-B bond angle changes little in the 25\u2013200 \xb0C temperature range and changes drastically after exceeding 200 \xb0C, which suggests that the temperature stability of piezoelectricity of the PZT sample originates from the temperature stability of the \u2220B-O2A-B bond angle of the T phase [(i)]. In addition, the \u2220B-O2A-B bond angle and \u2220O2A-B-O2 C bond angle of the T phase are equal during the heating process. Overall, the temperature stability of piezoelectricity of the PZT sample (the d 33 varies only 2.2 % in the 25\u2013200 \xb0C range) derives from the temperature stability of the \u2220B-O2A-B/\u2220O2A-B-O2 C bond angles of the T phase and the lattice parameter \u03b1 of the R phase. To deeply understand the mechanism of piezoelectricity from the domain structure, the domain morphology and local piezoelectric response were observed using PFM ( ) to scan the surface of 0.01Ta-Sm-PZT ceramic over an area of 4\xd74 \u03bcmE^{2}. The widths of the bright yellow and dark blue striped domains are in the 107\u2212150 nm and 57\u221275 nm ranges, respectively. The nanodomain structure in the PZT sample favours its high piezoelectricity. (e) shows schematic illustrations of defect dipoles in domains gradually turning under the action of an electric field. The defect dipoles rotate to the direction of an increased electric field, which elucidates that the high piezoelectric properties of the PZT sample originate from the electric-field-driven poling rotation [(e)]. The local poling (litho mode) treatment is utilized to observe the domain switching with the applied voltage (10, 20, 30, and 40 V) [(c)]. Domain switching is realized in the regions of 10, 20, 30, and 40 V, which means that the domains in the sample are easy to rotate. The easier the domains are to rotate, the higher the piezoelectricity of the piezoceramic. (d) shows the local domain switching of the unpoled sample observed by switching spectroscopy piezoresponse force microscopy (SS-PFM) with the 4\xd74 \u03bcm area scanned by applying a voltage of 15 V. The butterfly-shaped loop of amplitude and the hysteresis-like loop of phase in (d) are offset by +3.1 V from their centers. The left and right wings of the butterfly-shaped loop are asymmetrically shaped, where the amplitude values of the highest points in the positive and negative voltage directions are 608 pm and 844 pm, respectively.

                     33 by doping heterovalent ions in the PbZr0.54Ti0.46O3 ceramics at the A/B sites in the ABO3 lattice. The Sm3+-ion amount at the A-site remains constant, while the Ta5+-ion amount at the B-site changes. We utilized electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to investigate the reduction of oxygen vacancies, which are closely associated with the defect dipoles formed by heterovalent doping. We utilized piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction (XRD) combined with Rietveld refinement, and temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy to understand the mechanism of the temperature stability of the piezoelectric coefficient d

# INTRODUCTION
The conversion of mechanical energy and electrical energy can be realized by piezoelectric ceramics, and lead zirconate titanate (PZT)-based piezoceramics have been extensively used in civilian and military fields such as sensors, ultrasonic transducers, microdisplacement devices, and other electronic components. In light of the brisk evolution in IoT and AI technologies, there's a critical demand for cutting-edge electronics that rely on piezoelectric materials. Such materials should boast high values of the piezoelectric constant d 33, considerable electromechanical coupling coefficients k p, and dependable performance over a wide temperature range. In recent years, the study of heterovalent-ion doping at the A/B site of the ABO3 lattice of lead-based piezoelectric ceramics has been developed. Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 (PMN-PT) piezoceramics doped with A-site SmE^{3+}-ions have an ultrahigh d 33 of 1500 pC/N. High piezoelectric activity (d 33 = 680 pC/N and T C = 269 \xb0C) was achieved in A-site LiE^{+}-ion doped Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O3-Pb(Ni1/3Nb2/3)O3-Pb(Zr0.46Ti0.54)O3 (PNN-PZN-PZT) piezoceramics. High piezoelectric activity (d 33 = 563 pC/N and T C = 301 \xb0C) was obtained in Pb(Zr0.5Ti0.5)O3-Pb(Mg0.5W0.5)O3-Pb(Ni1/3Nb2/3)O3 (PZT-PMW-PNN) ceramics by doping B-site YbE^{3+} ions. High piezoelectric activity (d 33 = 640 pC/N and T C = 303 \xb0C) was achieved in Pb(Zr0.5Ti0.5)O3-Pb(Mg0.5W0.5)O3-Pb(Ni1/3Nb2/3)O3 (PZT-PMW-PNN) ceramics by doping B-site TaE^{5+} ions. High piezoelectric activity (d 33 = 864 pC/N and T C = 201 \xb0C) was achieved in PZT ceramics by doping B-site NbE^{5+} ions. The variation rate of the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 of PZT ceramics in the room temperature range to about 160 \xb0C can currently be as low as about 10 %. Further improvement of the temperature stability of the d 33 is an urgent problem for PZT ceramics. Our previous work has shown that PZT piezoceramics doped with A-site NdE^{3+} ions have excellent temperature stability of the piezoelectric coefficient d 33, with a d 33 change of only 3.6 % from 30 to 260 \xb0C. Studies on the temperature stability of the piezoelectric constant d 33 of piezoelectric ceramics are gradually emerging by in situ testing d 33 with temperature. and summarize some of the relevant data from the literature. In this work, we doped the A-site of the ABO3 lattice of PbZr0.54Ti0.46O3 ceramics with 0.01 SmE^{3+} ions and the B-site with different concentrations of TaE^{5+} ions to enhance the piezoelectric properties, in particular the piezoelectric temperature stability. We achieved an ultrahigh temperature stability of the piezoelectric constant d 33. The d 33 varies only 2.2 % over the 25\u2013200 \xb0C temperature range.

# CONCLUSION
The piezoelectric coefficient of piezoelectric ceramics has an ultrahigh temperature stability over a broad temperature range, which is extremely important for piezoelectric devices and sensors operating over a wide temperature range. 0.01Ta-Sm-PZT ceramic samples have a d 33 variation of only 2.2 % in the 25\u2013200 \xb0C range. 0.00Ta-Sm-PZT ceramic samples have a d 33 variation of only 4.3 % in the 25\u2013200 \xb0C range and 4.6 % in the 25\u2013257 \xb0C range. The ultrahigh temperature stability of the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 of the PZT piezoceramics arises from the stable phase structure (coexistence of tetragonal and rhombohedral phases) and the stable domain structure (large-size domains of a few micrometers), and in particular from the stable crystal structures (stabilized bond angles \u2220B-O2A-B/\u2220O2A-B-O2C of the tetragonal lattices and \u03b1 angles of the rhombohedral lattices).

**Notes**:
- Write complete chemical formulas (e.g. '(Use the abbreviation key-value pair to track the abbreviations while extracting composition-property keywords). Don't use abbreviations, but you can use different environment if multiple compositions have different d33 values in different environments. For e.g.: 'LiNbO3-Air' and 'LiNbO3-Vacuum'.
- If multiple compositions are mentioned with different d33 values, extract all compositions mentioning different type/environment with a '-' and coreresponding d33 values.
- Mos of the formula are provided in ABSTRACT or INTRODUCTION or first part of EXPERIMENTAL SYNTHESIS.
- Use element symbols (e.g. 'K' not 'Potassium')
- For compositions with variables:
   * If multiple d33 values exist: Extract all compositions by substituting each variable value
   * If single d33 value: Extract only the best composition
- Prioritize data from tables
- Preserve proper chemical notation including:
   * Subscripts for atom counts
   * Parentheses for grouped elements
   * Proper fraction formatting
- Include the measurement unit for d33 values (usually pC/N or pm/V)
- Identify the broader family/class of materials - can be abbreviated forms
- Include if there is any doping in the composition using '+' sign with the composition, e.g. 'LiNbO3 + 2%wt Mg'
- Don't remove brackets or parentheses from the chemical formula which is already in the composition. Also, sometimes fractions are written before the composition (mostly in ()) for composition mixtures, don't remove them.
- Don't modify the abbreviation from referenced papers unless full composition is not available.
- ALWAYS follow the asked JSON format. DON'T write any extra information such as note points or explanations.
", agent="Material Composition and Property Extractor", status="completed", output="I need to extract the material compositions, their corresponding d33 values, the unit for d33, and the material family from the provided text. I will focus only on the data from "This work" as specified in the instructions, and ignore data from referenced papers. I will also identify any abbreviations for the compositions from "This work".

From the "TABLES" section, specifically "Table 1. Reported data of temperature stability of piezoelectric constant d 33.", I can find the relevant data for "This work".

Compositions and d33 values from "This work":
- "0.01Ta-Sm-PZT": 530 pC/N
- "0.00Ta-Sm-PZT": 513 pC/N

The unit for d33 is "pC/N".

Now, I need to find the full chemical formula for "PZT" and "Sm-PZT" and "Ta-Sm-PZT".
From the "ABSTRACT": "We achieved ultrahigh temperature stability of the piezoelectric coefficient d33 by doping heterovalent ions in the PbZr0.54Ti0.46O3 ceramics at the A/B sites in the ABO3 lattice. The Sm3+-ion amount at the A-site remains constant, while the Ta5+-ion amount at the B-site changes. ... When x = 0.01, the performance of xTa-0.01Sm-PbZr0.54Ti0.46O3 ceramic is optimal: d33 = 530 pC/N..."
From the "INTRODUCTION": "...In this work, we doped the A-site of the ABO3 lattice of PbZr0.54Ti0.46O3 ceramics with 0.01 SmE^{3+} ions and the B-site with different concentrations of TaE^{5+} ions to enhance the piezoelectric properties, in particular the piezoelectric temperature stability."

So, the base composition is PbZr0.54Ti0.46O3.
The Sm3+-ion amount at the A-site remains constant at 0.01.
The Ta5+-ion amount at the B-site changes, represented by 'x'.

Therefore, the full composition is (x)Ta-0.01Sm-PbZr0.54Ti0.46O3.
Let's break down the compositions:
- "0.01Ta-Sm-PZT" corresponds to x=0.01 in xTa-0.01Sm-PbZr0.54Ti0.46O3. So, the full composition is 0.01Ta-0.01Sm-PbZr0.54Ti0.46O3.
- "0.00Ta-Sm-PZT" corresponds to x=0.00 in xTa-0.01Sm-PbZr0.54Ti0.46O3. So, the full composition is 0.00Ta-0.01Sm-PbZr0.54Ti0.46O3.

The family of the material is "PZT" (Lead Zirconate Titanate).

Abbreviations:
- PZT: PbZr0.54Ti0.46O3
