# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Powder XRD patterns of the CBNO-100xLBM ceramics are presented in (a). The diffraction peaks of all samples can be matched with the CBNO, indicating that Li, Bi, and Mn can diffuse into the CBNO crystal structure to form a solid solution within the experimental doping range. Notably, all samples exhibit abnormally strong (00l) diffraction peaks after doping, e.g. (008) and (0010). The bulk XRD patterns of all samples are shown in (b). The plane corresponding to the strongest reflection is the (115), consistent with previous reports that the strongest reflection of the BLSF compound is the (112 m + 1). No abnormal increase in the intensity of the diffraction peak is observed in the XRD data for the bulk samples. Based on the CBNO structure model (orthorhombic, A2 1 am space group) proposed by Blake et al. , Rietveld refinement results for x = 0 and x = 0.02 components are presented in (c)\u2013(d). The calculated results show good agreement with the experimental data (R wp = 8.23%\u20138.44 %, R p = 5.41%\u20136.29 %), and the calculated atomic coordinates are listed in. The contribution of each constituent ion to spontaneous polarization (P s) was estimated using the displacement-type ferroelectric volumetric spontaneous polarization intensity calculation method proposed by Shimakawa (Eq. ) , as illustrated in (e). where, m i, \u0394x i, Q i e, and V represent the site multiplicity, relative displacement of atoms along the a axis relative to the corresponding position in the parent phase structure, charge carried by ions, and unit cell volume, respectively. Notably, the P s of CBNO-2LBM (29.05 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}) was significantly higher than that of CBNO (24.4 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}), which may be attributed to local lattice distortion caused by doping. The orthorhombicity of the reaction sample, characterized by the ratio 2 (a\u2212b)/(a+b), exhibits an initial increase followed by a decrease as the doping amount increases. At x = 0.02, the sample displays the highest orthorhombicity, indicating the lowest symmetry. The crystal structures of the x = 0 and x = 0.02 components are depicted in (f). The introduction of Li, Bi, and Mn leads to compression of the NbO6 octahedron along the c axis, resulting in a significant reduction of the tilt angle (the angle between O1-O2 and the c axis) from 11.3908\xb0 to 8.9596\xb0, while the rotation angle (\u2220O4-O4-O4) remains relatively unchanged (9.9632\xb0\u20139.3610\xb0). Raman spectra of the CBNO-100xLBM ceramics in the wavenumber range from 20 cmE^{\u22121} to 1000 cmE^{\u22121} are shown in (g). All components exhibit similar phonon modes within this wavenumber range, consistent with the phonon modes of the orthorhombic CBNO structure reported by Shen et al.. The deconvolution of the Raman spectrum using Lorentz functions resulted in 16 peaks. Among these, strong phonon vibration modes are observed near 41.52, 64.03, 182.98, 205.76, 592.13, and 819.65 cmE^{\u22121}, marked as v1-v6, respectively. The evolution of the Raman peak positions for modes v1-v6 in CBNO-100xLBM ceramics with varying x values is depicted in (h). Modes v1-v3 are attributed to A site ion vibrations within the perovskite-like layer. The v5 mode corresponds to the stretching of oxygen atoms at the vertex of the NbO6 octahedron, while the v6 mode represents the symmetric stretching vibration of the NbO6 octahedron. As the doping amount increases, v1-v6 exhibit a shift toward lower wavenumbers. These results suggest that the introduction of Li, Bi, and Mn into the CBNO lattice induces significant local distortion due to mismatches in ionic radii and chemical valence states. To further analyze the grain growth of ceramics, the surface and cross-section of CBNO-100xLBM ceramics are characterized by scanning electron microscopy, as shown in and , respectively. The relative density of all samples was found to be greater than 95 %. Due to the low surface energy of the (00l) crystal plane, the growth rate of ceramics perpendicular to the c axis is accelerated, resulting in anisotropic strip-like grains, a morphological characteristic of BLSF compounds. With increasing doping amounts, grain growth on the surface is inhibited, and the micro-morphology gradually transitions to a disk shape, as shown in (a1-a5). Additionally, doping affects anisotropy during ceramic grain growth, causing the average grain size to decrease drastically from 10.73 \u03bcm (length) to 5.31 \u03bcm (length), accompanied by a decrease in the length/width value, as shown in (b)\u2013(c). The elemental composition and distribution of CBNO-2LBM ceramics are analyzed using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping, as shown in (d1-d5). The uniform distribution of all the constituent elements indicates that the doped elements enter the CBNO lattice. shows the cross-sectional morphology of CBNO-100xLBM ceramics, revealing anisotropic growth patterns. The fracture surface exhibits parallel stripes and a rough texture, attributable to the layered structure of CBNO-based ceramics. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to characterize the domain structure of CBNO-2LBM ceramic samples. The sample displays a high density of nanodomains, with a measured domain width ranging from approximately 4 \u03bcm to 10 nm, as shown in (a). In previous studies, Wang et al. systematically analyzed the domain structure of CBNO ceramics, which feature submicron domains with widths ranging from approximately 0.1 \u03bcm\u20130.5 \u03bcm. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) of CBNO-2LBM ceramics revealed periodic lattice fringes, as shown in (b). The spacing between adjacent fringes, accurately measured after fourier analysis using GMS3 software, was 0.53 nm, corresponding to the [011] plane , as shown in (c). (d)\u2013(e) presents the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of CBNO-2LBM ceramics along the [011] and [2\u203e1 1\u203e] zone axises, respectively. Patterns exhibit weak superlattice reflections of the (h00) and (hk0) types, a similar superlattice phenomenon was observed in SrBi2Nb2O9 and BaBi4Ti4O15 ceramics of BLSF compounds. illustrates the frequency dependence of the dielectric permittivity (\u03b5 r) and dielectric loss tangent (tan\u03b4) for the unpoled and poled CBNO-100xLBM ceramics. The anomalous peaks in dielectric permittivity and loss near 10 MHz for polarized samples can be ascribed to the piezoelectric effect. shows the variation in dielectric permittivity and dielectric loss tangent before and after the sample polarized at 100 kHz. The dielectric permittivity decreases after polarization by a DC field, indicating that non-180\xb0 domains predominantly contribute to the dielectric permittivity in unpoled ceramics. The temperature dependence of the \u03b5 r and tan\u03b4 for CBNO-100xLBM ceramics at 100 kHz, measured over the range from 50 \xb0C to 1000 \xb0C, is shown in (a)\u2013(b). As the doping concentration increases, the T C gradually decreases from 939 \xb0C to 917 \xb0C. No significant change is observed after doping for tan\u03b4. (a\u2013e) presents the ferroelectric hysteresis loops (P-E) and current density curves (J-E) for CBNO-100xLBM ceramics at 10 Hz, 160 \xb0C, and 250 kV/cm. The P-E loop of CBNO (x = 0) ceramic exhibits a narrow and flat shape, indicating poor ferroelectric properties. In contrast, the P-E loops of the doped samples are more saturated, suggesting that Li, Bi, and Mn doping significantly enhances the ferroelectric properties of CBNO ceramics. Particularly, the P-E loops and J-E curves of the x > 0.02 samples exhibit asymmetry, which can be attributed to the internal bias electric field within the doped samples. Doped samples show pronounced current peaks in the J-E curves, indicating that the ferroelectric domains within the ceramics are beginning to switch, which allows for the assessment of the coercive electric field (E C) of CBNO-100xLBM ceramics. The remanent polarization (P r) and E C values for the CBNO-100xLBM ceramics are shown in (f). The sample with x = 0.02 demonstrates the highest P r (\u223c9.42 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}) and the lowest E C (\u223c118 kV/cm), indicating a lower energy barrier for domain switching at this doping level and thereby exhibiting the best ferroelectric properties. Moreover, the experimentally measured value of P s (\u223c14.85 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}) is about half of our calculated result (\u223c29.05 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}). The reason to the difference may be that only the electric domains in the (CaNb2O7)E^{2-} layer can be switched under the action of an applied electric field. (a) illustrates the composition dependence of the piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) and planar electromechanical coupling coefficient (k p) of CBNO-100xLBM ceramics. It is evident that moderate Li, Bi, and Mn doping enhances the piezoelectric properties of CBNO ceramics. The trends in piezoelectric properties closely resemble those observed in ferroelectric properties, with both d 33 and k p reaching their maximum values at x = 0.02, which are 15.2 pC/N and 6.9 %, respectively. According to the empirical equation for piezoelectric properties (d33=2Q \u03b50 \u03b5r Pr), the d 33 of piezoelectric materials can be estimated from the product of \u03b5 r and P r. (a) shows that the composition dependence of \u03b5 r P r and its trend is the same as that of d 33. To assess the temperature stability of CBNO-100xLBM high-temperature piezoelectric ceramics, samples were annealed at selected temperatures for 2 h, after which the remaining d 33 at room temperature was measured, as shown in (b)\u2013(c). In the low-temperature range (T < 400 \xb0C), the d 33 of the samples shows a slight decrease, attributed to the presence of unstable non-180\xb0 domain walls within the ceramics. When the temperature exceeds 900 \xb0C, the d 33 of all samples begins to decrease sharply, indicating that the T C of these samples is higher than this temperature. Piezoelectric material undergoes a ferroelectric to paraelectric phase transition near the T C, resulting in the loss of its piezoelectric response. (d) shows the compositional dependence of the ratio of d 33 at 900 \xb0C to the initial d 33 E^{RT} value. It indicates that Li, Bi, and Mn doping significantly enhances the temperature stability of CBNO ceramics. Specifically, the remaining d 33 of CBNO-2LBM and CBNO-3LBM ceramics after annealing at 900 \xb0C for 2 h is 14.4 pC/N (\u223c94 %) and 13.5 pC/N (\u223c95 %), respectively. To reveal changes in the elemental composition and chemical valence states of the CBNO-100xLBM ceramics, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted, as shown in (a). The carbon peak (C 1s, 284.6 eV) is attributed to the testing process and can be corrected in the data analysis. The high-resolution XPS data of O 1s are shown in (b\u2013f). Based on previous studies, these peaks correspond to lattice oxygen (529.4 eV, OL), highly oxidized oxygen (530.8 eV, O2 E^{2\u2212}/OE^{\u2212}), and hydroxyl or carbonate groups (531.9 eV, -OH/CO3 E^{2\u2212}). The presence of O2 E^{2\u2212}/OE^{\u2212} is associated with the formation of oxygen vacancies, and the surface oxygen vacancy concentration of the sample can be evaluated by the area percentage of the O2 E^{2\u2212}/OE^{\u2212} peaks. (g) shows the relative proportions of OL, O2 E^{2\u2212}/OE^{\u2212}, and -OH/CO3 E^{2\u2212} in the O 1s spectra. It is observed that the proportion of OL decreases while the proportion of -OH/CO3 E^{2\u2212} increases with higher doping content, suggesting that doping alters the physical properties of the material surface. Additionally, with increased doping content, the intensity and area of peaks corresponding to O2 E^{2\u2212}/OE^{\u2212} increase, reflecting an increase in oxygen vacancy concentration. High-resolution XPS spectra of Ca 2p, Nb 3d, and Bi 4f orbitals are shown in. The binding energies of Ca 2p and Nb 3d remained relatively stable after doping with Li, Bi, and Mn, indicating that the electronic structure of the original perovskite layer did not undergo significant changes. The Bi 4f peaks are split into two components near 159.0 eV and 164.3 eV, corresponding to Bi 4f 7/2 and Bi 4f 5/2 spin orbitals from bismuth oxide in CBNO ceramics. The resistivity (\u03c1) of ceramics is a critical factor in practical applications as it directly affects the conductivity and dielectric properties of the material. Ceramics with high resistivity can effectively prevent current leakage and short circuiting. (h) illustrates the temperature dependence of the DC resistivity of CBNO-100xLBM ceramics in the range of 350 \xb0C\u2013750 \xb0C. The data show that the resistivity of the ceramics decreases gradually with increasing temperature, indicating that CBNO-100xLBM ceramics exhibit a negative temperature coefficient. Compared to CBNO (x = 0) ceramics, the resistivity of CBNO-100xLBM ceramics is enhanced by an order of magnitude. Firstly, introduction of LiE^{+}, BiE^{3+}, and MnE^{2+} increases the number of ionic types within the system and alters the potential field. Additionally, the substitution of low-valence MnE^{2+} for NbE^{5+} introduces lattice defects and oxygen vacancies, as shown in Eq. , these vacancies can closely combine with low-valence cations to form (Mn Nb\u2034\u2212 VO \xb7\xb7)\u2032 defect dipoles. CBNO-2LBM ceramics exhibit the outstanding \u03c1 of 2.85 M\u03a9 cm (at 600 \xb0C).  (i) illustrates the variation in DC resistivity with temperature for CBNO-2LBM ceramics under different oxygen concentrations. It is observed that resistivity decreases gradually as the oxygen partial pressure increases from 10E^{\u22124} atm (pure N2) to 1 atm (pure O2). This behavior suggests the presence of a p-type (holes) conduction mechanism in the ceramics, where the conduction is facilitated by the generation of holes due to the oxidation of oxygen vacancies (VO\u2033). These vacancies are primarily formed by the volatilization of Bi2O3 during the sintering process. As previously discussed, CBNO ceramics can enhance their electrical properties through the co-substitution of (Li0.5Bi0.5) at the A site and Mn at the B site. presents the Curie temperature, resistivity, and piezoelectric coefficient of CBNO-based high-temperature piezoelectric ceramics reported in recent years. The d 33 (\u223c15.2 pC/N) and T C (\u223c928 \xb0C) of CBNO-2LBM ceramics are comparable to those in other studies. Notably, it exhibits a higher \u03c1 (\u223c2.85 M\u03a9 cm at 600 \xb0C).

# TITLE
Achieving ultra-high resistivity and outstanding piezoelectric properties by co-substitution in CaBi<inf>2</inf>Nb<inf>2</inf>O<inf>9</inf> ceramics

# ABSTRACT
CaBi2Nb2O9 (CBNO) ceramics exhibit significant potential in the development of piezoelectric sensors suitable for extreme environments such as aerospace, metallurgy, and nuclear power plants. While previous studies have enhanced the piezoelectric response of CBNO ceramics, their insulating properties at high temperatures still require improvement. In this work, co-substitution of (Li0.5Bi0.5) at A site and Mn at B site was designed to improve the electrical properties of CBNO ceramics. Meanwhile, co-substitution of Ca by (Li0.5Bi0.5) reduces both the sintering temperature and volatilization of Bi2O3 during the sintering process. This modification results in an ultra-high T

# INTRODUCTION
In addition to a large piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) and high Curie temperature (T C), piezoelectric materials for high-temperature sensors must also exhibit excellent resistivity (\u03c1), particularly at 600 \xb0C or higher. High \u03c1 ensures accurate transmission of electrical signals, reduces noise and signal loss, and enables effective conversion of mechanical strain into electrical signals. Compared to traditional perovskite structure piezoelectric materials, bismuth layered structure piezoelectric ceramics (BLSF) are emerging as promising candidates for high-temperature sensors due to their outstanding \u03c1, high T C, and low dielectric loss. Calcium bismuth niobate (CaBi2Nb2O9, CBNO) is a well-known bismuth layered structure ferroelectric (BLSF) that has attracted considerable attention due to its ultra-high T C (\u223c940 \xb0C) and depoling temperature (up to 800 \xb0C). However, the unique arrangement of the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layers and (CaNb2O7)E^{2-} layers in the CBNO structure results in a piezoelectric response that is typically inferior to that of commercially available lead-based piezoelectric ceramics. The d 33 value of CBNO samples obtained via conventional sintering methods is approximately 6 pC/N. Additionally, in the BLSF system, the volatilization of bismuth oxide (Bi2O3) at high temperatures generates intrinsic oxygen vacancies, which inevitably leads to a decrease in the resistivity of the ceramics. Currently, researchers primarily employ texture engineering and compositional control strategies to enhance the piezoelectric properties of CBNO ceramics. Key texture engineering techniques include Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) , Hot-Pressing Sintering (HPS) , Two-Step Sintering (TSS)  and Templated Grain Growth (TGG). These methods can significantly improve the piezoelectric response of CBNO ceramics, with d 33 values ranging from 9.8 pC/N to 19.5 pC/N. However, it is important to note that the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layer acts as an insulating medium within the structure. For instance, the resistivity of CBNO ceramics prepared by TGG and TGG + HPS methods at 600 \xb0C is 4.5 \xd7 10E^{3} \u03a9 cm and 8.2 \xd7 10E^{4} \u03a9 cm, respectively. Recent research indicates that component regulation for BLSF system can simultaneously improve both d 33 and \u03c1. For instance, doping alkali and rare earth metals at the A site, such as NaBi , LiCe , LiBiPr , LiCeGd , has been shown to effectively enhance the electrical properties of CBNO ceramics. For example, doping with WCr , MoCr , WCu  exemplifies this effect. Moreover, simultaneous doping of A site and B site ions is more effective in improving the electrical properties of ceramics, as evidenced by studies on BaSr-WMn , Ce-W , Ce-WMn. Research indicates that appropriate lattice distortion can enhance the electrical properties of CBNO ceramics. In addition, numerous studies have demonstrated that the perovskite-like layer in the Mn-doped CBNO structure can enhance both resistivity and piezoelectric properties. In this work, co-substitution of (Li0.5Bi0.5) at A site and Mn at B site was proposed to improve the electrical properties of CBNO ceramics. This modification gives rise to the reductions of sintering temperature and volatilization of Bi2O3. MnE^{2+} can capture weakly bonded vacancies to form defect dipoles, thereby enhancing the insulation properties of CBNO ceramics. The observed improvement in electrical properties can be attributed to the local distortion of the crystal structure, small ferroelectric domain size, formation of defect dipoles, carrier localization, and dense microstructure, as shown in (a\u2013d). The d 33 and P r of the designed Ca1-2x (Li0.5Bi0.5)2x Bi2Nb2-x Mn x O9 with x = 0.02 are increased by 134 % and 122 %, respectively. The electrical resistance of the ceramic is 2.85 M\u03a9 cm at 600 \xb0C, which is 11 times higher than that of CBNO (x = 0), as indicated in (e).

# CONCLUSION
In summary, the phase structure, micro-morphology, and electrical properties of CBNO-100xLBM ceramics have been extensively investigated. The replacement of NbE^{5+} with low-valent MnE^{2+} induces lattice defects and oxygen vacancies. However, these vacancies can form (Mn Nb\u2034\u2212 VO \xb7\xb7)\u2032 defect dipoles tightly bound with low-valent MnE^{2+}, thereby reducing long-range migration at high temperatures. Additionally, co-doping with Li, Bi, and Mn results in lattice distortion and small domain size, which significantly enhances piezoelectric, ferroelectric, and insulating properties in CBNO-100xLBM ceramics. Particularly, CBNO-2LBM ceramic exhibits excellent electrical properties with T C, d 33, k p, P r, and \u03c1 values of 928 \xb0C, 15.2 pC/N, 6.9 %, 9.42 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, and 2.85 M\u03a9 cm (at 600 \xb0C), respectively. These results indicate that CBNO-2LBM ceramics have potential applications in high-temperature piezoelectric sensors.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Powder XRD patterns of the CBNO-100xLBM ceramics are presented in (a). The diffraction peaks of all samples can be matched with the CBNO, indicating that Li, Bi, and Mn can diffuse into the CBNO crystal structure to form a solid solution within the experimental doping range. Notably, all samples exhibit abnormally strong (00l) diffraction peaks after doping, e.g. (008) and (0010). The bulk XRD patterns of all samples are shown in (b). The plane corresponding to the strongest reflection is the (115), consistent with previous reports that the strongest reflection of the BLSF compound is the (112 m + 1). No abnormal increase in the intensity of the diffraction peak is observed in the XRD data for the bulk samples. Based on the CBNO structure model (orthorhombic, A2 1 am space group) proposed by Blake et al. , Rietveld refinement results for x = 0 and x = 0.02 components are presented in (c)\u2013(d). The calculated results show good agreement with the experimental data (R wp = 8.23%\u20138.44 %, R p = 5.41%\u20136.29 %), and the calculated atomic coordinates are listed in. The contribution of each constituent ion to spontaneous polarization (P s) was estimated using the displacement-type ferroelectric volumetric spontaneous polarization intensity calculation method proposed by Shimakawa (Eq. ) , as illustrated in (e). where, m i, \u0394x i, Q i e, and V represent the site multiplicity, relative displacement of atoms along the a axis relative to the corresponding position in the parent phase structure, charge carried by ions, and unit cell volume, respectively. Notably, the P s of CBNO-2LBM (29.05 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}) was significantly higher than that of CBNO (24.4 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}), which may be attributed to local lattice distortion caused by doping. The orthorhombicity of the reaction sample, characterized by the ratio 2 (a\u2212b)/(a+b), exhibits an initial increase followed by a decrease as the doping amount increases. At x = 0.02, the sample displays the highest orthorhombicity, indicating the lowest symmetry. The crystal structures of the x = 0 and x = 0.02 components are depicted in (f). The introduction of Li, Bi, and Mn leads to compression of the NbO6 octahedron along the c axis, resulting in a significant reduction of the tilt angle (the angle between O1-O2 and the c axis) from 11.3908\xb0 to 8.9596\xb0, while the rotation angle (\u2220O4-O4-O4) remains relatively unchanged (9.9632\xb0\u20139.3610\xb0). Raman spectra of the CBNO-100xLBM ceramics in the wavenumber range from 20 cmE^{\u22121} to 1000 cmE^{\u22121} are shown in (g). All components exhibit similar phonon modes within this wavenumber range, consistent with the phonon modes of the orthorhombic CBNO structure reported by Shen et al.. The deconvolution of the Raman spectrum using Lorentz functions resulted in 16 peaks. Among these, strong phonon vibration modes are observed near 41.52, 64.03, 182.98, 205.76, 592.13, and 819.65 cmE^{\u22121}, marked as v1-v6, respectively. The evolution of the Raman peak positions for modes v1-v6 in CBNO-100xLBM ceramics with varying x values is depicted in (h). Modes v1-v3 are attributed to A site ion vibrations within the perovskite-like layer. The v5 mode corresponds to the stretching of oxygen atoms at the vertex of the NbO6 octahedron, while the v6 mode represents the symmetric stretching vibration of the NbO6 octahedron. As the doping amount increases, v1-v6 exhibit a shift toward lower wavenumbers. These results suggest that the introduction of Li, Bi, and Mn into the CBNO lattice induces significant local distortion due to mismatches in ionic radii and chemical valence states. To further analyze the grain growth of ceramics, the surface and cross-section of CBNO-100xLBM ceramics are characterized by scanning electron microscopy, as shown in and , respectively. The relative density of all samples was found to be greater than 95 %. Due to the low surface energy of the (00l) crystal plane, the growth rate of ceramics perpendicular to the c axis is accelerated, resulting in anisotropic strip-like grains, a morphological characteristic of BLSF compounds. With increasing doping amounts, grain growth on the surface is inhibited, and the micro-morphology gradually transitions to a disk shape, as shown in (a1-a5). Additionally, doping affects anisotropy during ceramic grain growth, causing the average grain size to decrease drastically from 10.73 \u03bcm (length) to 5.31 \u03bcm (length), accompanied by a decrease in the length/width value, as shown in (b)\u2013(c). The elemental composition and distribution of CBNO-2LBM ceramics are analyzed using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping, as shown in (d1-d5). The uniform distribution of all the constituent elements indicates that the doped elements enter the CBNO lattice. shows the cross-sectional morphology of CBNO-100xLBM ceramics, revealing anisotropic growth patterns. The fracture surface exhibits parallel stripes and a rough texture, attributable to the layered structure of CBNO-based ceramics. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to characterize the domain structure of CBNO-2LBM ceramic samples. The sample displays a high density of nanodomains, with a measured domain width ranging from approximately 4 \u03bcm to 10 nm, as shown in (a). In previous studies, Wang et al. systematically analyzed the domain structure of CBNO ceramics, which feature submicron domains with widths ranging from approximately 0.1 \u03bcm\u20130.5 \u03bcm. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) of CBNO-2LBM ceramics revealed periodic lattice fringes, as shown in (b). The spacing between adjacent fringes, accurately measured after fourier analysis using GMS3 software, was 0.53 nm, corresponding to the [011] plane , as shown in (c). (d)\u2013(e) presents the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of CBNO-2LBM ceramics along the [011] and [2\u203e1 1\u203e] zone axises, respectively. Patterns exhibit weak superlattice reflections of the (h00) and (hk0) types, a similar superlattice phenomenon was observed in SrBi2Nb2O9 and BaBi4Ti4O15 ceramics of BLSF compounds. illustrates the frequency dependence of the dielectric permittivity (\u03b5 r) and dielectric loss tangent (tan\u03b4) for the unpoled and poled CBNO-100xLBM ceramics. The anomalous peaks in dielectric permittivity and loss near 10 MHz for polarized samples can be ascribed to the piezoelectric effect. shows the variation in dielectric permittivity and dielectric loss tangent before and after the sample polarized at 100 kHz. The dielectric permittivity decreases after polarization by a DC field, indicating that non-180\xb0 domains predominantly contribute to the dielectric permittivity in unpoled ceramics. The temperature dependence of the \u03b5 r and tan\u03b4 for CBNO-100xLBM ceramics at 100 kHz, measured over the range from 50 \xb0C to 1000 \xb0C, is shown in (a)\u2013(b). As the doping concentration increases, the T C gradually decreases from 939 \xb0C to 917 \xb0C. No significant change is observed after doping for tan\u03b4. (a\u2013e) presents the ferroelectric hysteresis loops (P-E) and current density curves (J-E) for CBNO-100xLBM ceramics at 10 Hz, 160 \xb0C, and 250 kV/cm. The P-E loop of CBNO (x = 0) ceramic exhibits a narrow and flat shape, indicating poor ferroelectric properties. In contrast, the P-E loops of the doped samples are more saturated, suggesting that Li, Bi, and Mn doping significantly enhances the ferroelectric properties of CBNO ceramics. Particularly, the P-E loops and J-E curves of the x > 0.02 samples exhibit asymmetry, which can be attributed to the internal bias electric field within the doped samples. Doped samples show pronounced current peaks in the J-E curves, indicating that the ferroelectric domains within the ceramics are beginning to switch, which allows for the assessment of the coercive electric field (E C) of CBNO-100xLBM ceramics. The remanent polarization (P r) and E C values for the CBNO-100xLBM ceramics are shown in (f). The sample with x = 0.02 demonstrates the highest P r (\u223c9.42 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}) and the lowest E C (\u223c118 kV/cm), indicating a lower energy barrier for domain switching at this doping level and thereby exhibiting the best ferroelectric properties. Moreover, the experimentally measured value of P s (\u223c14.85 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}) is about half of our calculated result (\u223c29.05 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}). The reason to the difference may be that only the electric domains in the (CaNb2O7)E^{2-} layer can be switched under the action of an applied electric field. (a) illustrates the composition dependence of the piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) and planar electromechanical coupling coefficient (k p) of CBNO-100xLBM ceramics. It is evident that moderate Li, Bi, and Mn doping enhances the piezoelectric properties of CBNO ceramics. The trends in piezoelectric properties closely resemble those observed in ferroelectric properties, with both d 33 and k p reaching their maximum values at x = 0.02, which are 15.2 pC/N and 6.9 %, respectively. According to the empirical equation for piezoelectric properties (d33=2Q \u03b50 \u03b5r Pr), the d 33 of piezoelectric materials can be estimated from the product of \u03b5 r and P r. (a) shows that the composition dependence of \u03b5 r P r and its trend is the same as that of d 33. To assess the temperature stability of CBNO-100xLBM high-temperature piezoelectric ceramics, samples were annealed at selected temperatures for 2 h, after which the remaining d 33 at room temperature was measured, as shown in (b)\u2013(c). In the low-temperature range (T < 400 \xb0C), the d 33 of the samples shows a slight decrease, attributed to the presence of unstable non-180\xb0 domain walls within the ceramics. When the temperature exceeds 900 \xb0C, the d 33 of all samples begins to decrease sharply, indicating that the T C of these samples is higher than this temperature. Piezoelectric material undergoes a ferroelectric to paraelectric phase transition near the T C, resulting in the loss of its piezoelectric response. (d) shows the compositional dependence of the ratio of d 33 at 900 \xb0C to the initial d 33 E^{RT} value. It indicates that Li, Bi, and Mn doping significantly enhances the temperature stability of CBNO ceramics. Specifically, the remaining d 33 of CBNO-2LBM and CBNO-3LBM ceramics after annealing at 900 \xb0C for 2 h is 14.4 pC/N (\u223c94 %) and 13.5 pC/N (\u223c95 %), respectively. To reveal changes in the elemental composition and chemical valence states of the CBNO-100xLBM ceramics, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted, as shown in (a). The carbon peak (C 1s, 284.6 eV) is attributed to the testing process and can be corrected in the data analysis. The high-resolution XPS data of O 1s are shown in (b\u2013f). Based on previous studies, these peaks correspond to lattice oxygen (529.4 eV, OL), highly oxidized oxygen (530.8 eV, O2 E^{2\u2212}/OE^{\u2212}), and hydroxyl or carbonate groups (531.9 eV, -OH/CO3 E^{2\u2212}). The presence of O2 E^{2\u2212}/OE^{\u2212} is associated with the formation of oxygen vacancies, and the surface oxygen vacancy concentration of the sample can be evaluated by the area percentage of the O2 E^{2\u2212}/OE^{\u2212} peaks. (g) shows the relative proportions of OL, O2 E^{2\u2212}/OE^{\u2212}, and -OH/CO3 E^{2\u2212} in the O 1s spectra. It is observed that the proportion of OL decreases while the proportion of -OH/CO3 E^{2\u2212} increases with higher doping content, suggesting that doping alters the physical properties of the material surface. Additionally, with increased doping content, the intensity and area of peaks corresponding to O2 E^{2\u2212}/OE^{\u2212} increase, reflecting an increase in oxygen vacancy concentration. High-resolution XPS spectra of Ca 2p, Nb 3d, and Bi 4f orbitals are shown in. The binding energies of Ca 2p and Nb 3d remained relatively stable after doping with Li, Bi, and Mn, indicating that the electronic structure of the original perovskite layer did not undergo significant changes. The Bi 4f peaks are split into two components near 159.0 eV and 164.3 eV, corresponding to Bi 4f 7/2 and Bi 4f 5/2 spin orbitals from bismuth oxide in CBNO ceramics. The resistivity (\u03c1) of ceramics is a critical factor in practical applications as it directly affects the conductivity and dielectric properties of the material. Ceramics with high resistivity can effectively prevent current leakage and short circuiting. (h) illustrates the temperature dependence of the DC resistivity of CBNO-100xLBM ceramics in the range of 350 \xb0C\u2013750 \xb0C. The data show that the resistivity of the ceramics decreases gradually with increasing temperature, indicating that CBNO-100xLBM ceramics exhibit a negative temperature coefficient. Compared to CBNO (x = 0) ceramics, the resistivity of CBNO-100xLBM ceramics is enhanced by an order of magnitude. Firstly, introduction of LiE^{+}, BiE^{3+}, and MnE^{2+} increases the number of ionic types within the system and alters the potential field. Additionally, the substitution of low-valence MnE^{2+} for NbE^{5+} introduces lattice defects and oxygen vacancies, as shown in Eq. , these vacancies can closely combine with low-valence cations to form (Mn Nb\u2034\u2212 VO \xb7\xb7)\u2032 defect dipoles. CBNO-2LBM ceramics exhibit the outstanding \u03c1 of 2.85 M\u03a9 cm (at 600 \xb0C).  (i) illustrates the variation in DC resistivity with temperature for CBNO-2LBM ceramics under different oxygen concentrations. It is observed that resistivity decreases gradually as the oxygen partial pressure increases from 10E^{\u22124} atm (pure N2) to 1 atm (pure O2). This behavior suggests the presence of a p-type (holes) conduction mechanism in the ceramics, where the conduction is facilitated by the generation of holes due to the oxidation of oxygen vacancies (VO\u2033). These vacancies are primarily formed by the volatilization of Bi2O3 during the sintering process. As previously discussed, CBNO ceramics can enhance their electrical properties through the co-substitution of (Li0.5Bi0.5) at the A site and Mn at the B site. presents the Curie temperature, resistivity, and piezoelectric coefficient of CBNO-based high-temperature piezoelectric ceramics reported in recent years. The d 33 (\u223c15.2 pC/N) and T C (\u223c928 \xb0C) of CBNO-2LBM ceramics are comparable to those in other studies. Notably, it exhibits a higher \u03c1 (\u223c2.85 M\u03a9 cm at 600 \xb0C).

Achieving ultra-high resistivity and outstanding piezoelectric properties by co-substitution in CaBi<inf>2</inf>Nb<inf>2</inf>O<inf>9</inf> ceramics

# ABSTRACT
CaBi2Nb2O9 (CBNO) ceramics exhibit significant potential in the development of piezoelectric sensors suitable for extreme environments such as aerospace, metallurgy, and nuclear power plants. While previous studies have enhanced the piezoelectric response of CBNO ceramics, their insulating properties at high temperatures still require improvement. In this work, co-substitution of (Li0.5Bi0.5) at A site and Mn at B site was designed to improve the electrical properties of CBNO ceramics. Meanwhile, co-substitution of Ca by (Li0.5Bi0.5) reduces both the sintering temperature and volatilization of Bi2O3 during the sintering process. This modification results in an ultra-high T

# INTRODUCTION
In addition to a large piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) and high Curie temperature (T C), piezoelectric materials for high-temperature sensors must also exhibit excellent resistivity (\u03c1), particularly at 600 \xb0C or higher. High \u03c1 ensures accurate transmission of electrical signals, reduces noise and signal loss, and enables effective conversion of mechanical strain into electrical signals. Compared to traditional perovskite structure piezoelectric materials, bismuth layered structure piezoelectric ceramics (BLSF) are emerging as promising candidates for high-temperature sensors due to their outstanding \u03c1, high T C, and low dielectric loss. Calcium bismuth niobate (CaBi2Nb2O9, CBNO) is a well-known bismuth layered structure ferroelectric (BLSF) that has attracted considerable attention due to its ultra-high T C (\u223c940 \xb0C) and depoling temperature (up to 800 \xb0C). However, the unique arrangement of the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layers and (CaNb2O7)E^{2-} layers in the CBNO structure results in a piezoelectric response that is typically inferior to that of commercially available lead-based piezoelectric ceramics. The d 33 value of CBNO samples obtained via conventional sintering methods is approximately 6 pC/N. Additionally, in the BLSF system, the volatilization of bismuth oxide (Bi2O3) at high temperatures generates intrinsic oxygen vacancies, which inevitably leads to a decrease in the resistivity of the ceramics. Currently, researchers primarily employ texture engineering and compositional control strategies to enhance the piezoelectric properties of CBNO ceramics. Key texture engineering techniques include Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) , Hot-Pressing Sintering (HPS) , Two-Step Sintering (TSS)  and Templated Grain Growth (TGG). These methods can significantly improve the piezoelectric response of CBNO ceramics, with d 33 values ranging from 9.8 pC/N to 19.5 pC/N. However, it is important to note that the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layer acts as an insulating medium within the structure. For instance, the resistivity of CBNO ceramics prepared by TGG and TGG + HPS methods at 600 \xb0C is 4.5 \xd7 10E^{3} \u03a9 cm and 8.2 \xd7 10E^{4} \u03a9 cm, respectively. Recent research indicates that component regulation for BLSF system can simultaneously improve both d 33 and \u03c1. For instance, doping alkali and rare earth metals at the A site, such as NaBi , LiCe , LiBiPr , LiCeGd , has been shown to effectively enhance the electrical properties of CBNO ceramics. For example, doping with WCr , MoCr , WCu  exemplifies this effect. Moreover, simultaneous doping of A site and B site ions is more effective in improving the electrical properties of ceramics, as evidenced by studies on BaSr-WMn , Ce-W , Ce-WMn. Research indicates that appropriate lattice distortion can enhance the electrical properties of CBNO ceramics. In addition, numerous studies have demonstrated that the perovskite-like layer in the Mn-doped CBNO structure can enhance both resistivity and piezoelectric properties. In this work, co-substitution of (Li0.5Bi0.5) at A site and Mn at B site was proposed to improve the electrical properties of CBNO ceramics. This modification gives rise to the reductions of sintering temperature and volatilization of Bi2O3. MnE^{2+} can capture weakly bonded vacancies to form defect dipoles, thereby enhancing the insulation properties of CBNO ceramics. The observed improvement in electrical properties can be attributed to the local distortion of the crystal structure, small ferroelectric domain size, formation of defect dipoles, carrier localization, and dense microstructure, as shown in (a\u2013d). The d 33 and P r of the designed Ca1-2x (Li0.5Bi0.5)2x Bi2Nb2-x Mn x O9 with x = 0.02 are increased by 134 % and 122 %, respectively. The electrical resistance of the ceramic is 2.85 M\u03a9 cm at 600 \xb0C, which is 11 times higher than that of CBNO (x = 0), as indicated in (e).

# CONCLUSION
In summary, the phase structure, micro-morphology, and electrical properties of CBNO-100xLBM ceramics have been extensively investigated. The replacement of NbE^{5+} with low-valent MnE^{2+} induces lattice defects and oxygen vacancies. However, these vacancies can form (Mn Nb\u2034\u2212 VO \xb7\xb7)\u2032 defect dipoles tightly bound with low-valent MnE^{2+}, thereby reducing long-range migration at high temperatures. Additionally, co-doping with Li, Bi, and Mn results in lattice distortion and small domain size, which significantly enhances piezoelectric, ferroelectric, and insulating properties in CBNO-100xLBM ceramics. Particularly, CBNO-2LBM ceramic exhibits excellent electrical properties with T C, d 33, k p, P r, and \u03c1 values of 928 \xb0C, 15.2 pC/N, 6.9 %, 9.42 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, and 2.85 M\u03a9 cm (at 600 \xb0C), respectively. These results indicate that CBNO-2LBM ceramics have potential applications in high-temperature piezoelectric sensors.
