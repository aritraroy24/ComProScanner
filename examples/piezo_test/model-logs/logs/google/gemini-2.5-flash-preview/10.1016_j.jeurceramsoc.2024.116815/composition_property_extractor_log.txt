# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Thermal analysis was performed on the starting powders of K2CO3, Na2CO3, and Nb2O5 with designated stoichiometry for KNN synthesis in air, as depicted in. The thermal decomposition consists of two stages; the first starts at 200 \xb0C and finishes at 413 \xb0C, in which a steady decrease of mass up to 413 \xb0C is visible. The second stage begins at 413 \xb0C, indicated by a slope change in the TG curve, and finishes at 640 \xb0C, with an exothermic peak. The summary reaction of alkali carbonates and niobium oxide is described by  Therefore, based on the TG/DTA analysis, a calcination temperature above 640 \xb0C should be necessary to complete the formation of the KNN phase ( it has also been previously shown that the formation of KNN occurs between 400 and 700 \xb0C , mostly characterized with the same decomposition step between 400 and 540 \xb0C and the reaction one between 540 \xb0C and the end of the reaction. For pure KNN, temperatures above 700 \xb0C are often suggested for the completion of solid-state chemical reactions. At all calcination temperatures, KNN phase peaks are present, but the peaks become sharper with increasing calcination temperatures. That means a higher crystallinity and could be confirmed by the full width at half maximum (FWHM) value of (110) diffraction peak. It should be noted that the powder calcined at 875 \xb0C shows less bimodality and tends to show a unimodal distribution, while the two others have two merged distributions, revealing a strong bimodal particle size distribution. However, the average particle size of the calcined powder at 875 \xb0C is 3.35 \xb5m, which is twice as large as powders calcined at lower temperatures ( ). XRD patterns of ceramics after densification and re-oxidation exhibit a typical orthorhombic perovskite structure, as shown in c. A stable solid solution with a small amount of secondary phase of K2Nb8O21 for P-KNN-750 and P-KNN-875 can be observed. Notably, the processing temperatures during densification (200 \xb0C) and re-oxidation (850 \xb0C) are much lower than the conventional sintering temperature window of 1100\u20131140 \xb0C and the SPS temperature window of 900\u20131000 \xb0C. The densities of the ceramics are nearly identical, approaching a value of 4.48\u20134.50 g/cm\xb3, corresponding to a relative density of 99.5\u201399.7 %. shows a fractured surface. The ceramics have a dense microstructure with cubic-shaped grains in all cases, which is typical for KNN. The grain size increases between P-KNN-700 and P-KNN-875, i.e., from 700 \xb0C to 850 \xb0C , but is generally in the range of the powder particle size, indicating very little grain growth. Within these SEM images, bimodal grain size distributions become evident. Bimodal grain size distributions and abnormal grain growth were previously reported for KNN and other niobates. A clear evolution emerges as we explore the relationship between calcination temperature and ceramic\u2019s final average grain size. The average grain size evolves from 0.227 \xb5m to 1.25 \xb5m for calcination temperatures 700 \xb0C and 875 \xb0C, respectively, as illustrated in. However, the calcination temperature does not influence the ceramics\u2019 density. To make sure that the presented route could produce a chemically homogeneous ceramic, EDS was performed. This is particularly important in the case of KNN, where the different dissolution rates of K, Na, and Nb might induce inhomogeneity. No discernible chemical contrast was evident by EDS Mapping (d), further ruling out the chemical inhomogeneity of our materials. Bright-field TEM images are shown in a\u2013f. In this aspect, KNN is different from other cold-sintered ferroelectric perovskites, such as BaTiO3, where dislocations are very uncommon. The observation of dislocations aligns, to some extent, with the findings of Tsuji and Nakagawa et al. in their study of KNN. Nakagawa et al. have claimed that dislocations could be largely eliminated by annealing at 700 \xb0C for 1 h. Hence, one could conclude that O 2 annealing at 850 \xb0C might have reduced the number of dislocations, although it did not completely eliminate them. This could be related to the nature of KNN, as the end member KNbO3 is one of the rare perovskite materials plastically deformable already at room temperature. One could consider the role of dislocations as 1D-defects and their contribution to electrical conductivity as a conductive and charge transport pathway or to large-signal piezoelectric coefficients or diffuse phase transition, where an increase in dislocation density may reduce the permittivity and cause a broadening of the phase transition region. Previous cold sintering approaches, using water as a liquid, yielded a density of only 85 % after annealing of 800 \xb0C for 2 h in air. Although ceramics prepared using KOH+NaOH (10 mol/L) could achieve densities above 95 % for KNN and BaTiO3 , the use of KOH+NaOH as the transient liquid can hinder industrial-scale production. In the cold-sintering assisted processes, stainless steel components such as punch, die, and cylinder are highly prone to corrosion, particularly at 300 \xb0C. Compared to previous work , in which it is claimed that post-annealing temperatures above 1000 \xb0C are necessary for the final densification of KNN, our investigation reveals that a high-density, pure KNN material can be successfully obtained through a CSA approach and subsequent O 2 annealing offering a promising avenue for sintering of pure and chemically-modified KNN. highlights a comparative view of the temperature-dependent dielectric permittivity and dielectric loss. Significantly, at room temperature, the relative permittivity of P-KNN-875 is observed to be the highest among the samples. However, there is no clear trend with increasing temperature as P-KNN-700 exhibits greater permittivity values compared to P-KNN-750. In this sequence, P-KNN-875 exhibits a higher permittivity than both P-KNN-700 and P-KNN-750, in descending order. The cold-sintered KNN ceramics exhibit a phase transition from orthorhombic to tetragonal (T O-T ) at 200 \xb0C. The Curie temperature T c is 410 \xb0C. Interestingly, the slightly higher T c observed in P-KNN-875 may be attributed to a subtle change in the lattice distortion , compositional fluctuations or due to a grain-size effect. In , the variations in permittivity (\u03b5\u2032 r ) with temperature are also depicted across different frequencies. At room temperature, the increased dielectric loss of P-KNN-700 and P-KNN-750 at low frequencies is evident. Meanwhile, a stable capacitance (C\u2019 P ) is observed for the P-KNN-875 sample. For P-KNN-700 and P-KNN-750 samples, leaky loops were discerned, indicative of a notable contribution from leakage current (a). Conversely, our large-signal data analysis reveals that the P-KNN-875 sample boasts well-defined ferroelectric polarization loops devoid of leakage with a saturated ferroelectric curve and a remnant polarization (P r ) of 26.7 \u03bcC/cm\xb2. This value surpasses the reported data for cold-sintered KNN ceramics in the literature. It is worth noting that pure KNN ceramics, in most cases, could not be densified through conventional sintering , thereby measuring a ferroelectric polarization loop was always challenging. Nevertheless, Haugen et al. reported that phase-pure KNN ceramic with a relative density of 94 % could only yield a remnant polarization of 9.8 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, which is significantly lower than that value of P-KNN-875. b shows the butterfly strain-electric field (S-E) curve for P-KNN-875 and P-KNN-700. For P-KNN-700, the significant differences between the samples were confirmed. Domain wall pinning by dislocation network has been observed for the BaTiO3 single crystals, where P r was hugely suppressed, and E c has been largely increased. Although high dislocation density exists in P-KNN-875, it seems that P r value is not noticeably affected by 1D defects, as P-KNN-875 still shows high Pr values similar to the highly dense hot-pressed KNN, where the sample was dislocation-free. Hence, the dislocation effect on KNN in the present study is not conclusive. Ultimately, a significant electromechanical response was observed for the sample when the calcining temperature increased to 875 \xb0C, as evidenced by the direct piezoelectric coefficient d 33 increase. This could be correlated with the highest permittivity and room temperature \u03b5 r (d 33\u221d \u03b5 r* P r/s) of this ceramic. For a more comprehensive perspective, unipolar strain measurements were conducted under a maximum electric field of 4 kV/mm (as depicted in c). These measurements revealed a significantly improved unipolar strain of 0.10 % within the P-KNN-875 ceramic, accompanied by an enhanced converse piezoelectric coefficient d 33 * value of 248 pm/V. This d 33 * value is 1.7 times higher than that of P-KNN-700 and P-KNN-750 ceramics. The pinnacle of these findings is the P-KNN-875 sample, showcasing the highest piezoelectric properties with a d 33 value of 120 pC/N and d 33 * value of 248 pm/V. These values could be particularly compared with KNN produced with other techniques. Regularly-sintered pure K0.5Na0.5NbO3 originally shows poor piezoelectric properties (d 33 \u223c 80\u2013100 pC/N) However, hot-pressed counterparts have been reported to have higher piezoelectric properties of d 33 = 141\u2013148 pC/N. To further evaluate the electrical properties of the ceramic samples, we conducted measurements of the frequency-dependent impedance across a temperature spectrum. displays the Nyquist plot of the complex resistance (Z\u2019-Z\u2019\u2019) at 400 \xb0C for all specimens. By investigating these two, measured data have been fitted using an equivalent circuit comprising one R-CPE-C (resistance-constant phase elements and capacitance). The semicircle with a capacitance range of 0.5 \xd7 10E^{\u201310} to 9 \xd7 10E^{\u201310} F can be observed within the measured frequency range (a), which can be correlated with the bulk ferroelectric response. Comparing the P-KNN-875 and P-KNN-750, we find a difference in the resistance values by a factor of 3  at 500 \xb0C. We noted differences between the samples\u2019 electrical conductivity with the help of Arrhenius plots (b). The activation energies (E a ) are determined to be 1.04\u20131.36 eV based on the slopes of fitting lines (b). Those extracted E a values are in the range of values reported for KNN and perovskite ceramics. When comparing ceramics, the changes in electrical conductivity and activation energy, then, could probably be rationalized through an intrinsic defect structure variation due to the unintentionally formed A-site vacancies and respective charge-compensating oxygen vacancies (V A \u2032 and V O \u2022\u2022) and holes h \u2022. The data were compared with hot-pressed pure KNN, shown by the solid line, which has comparable dielectric and electrochemical properties. The impedance results suggest that the current route eventually leads to a lower concentration of the intrinsic charge carriers and, subsequently, drastically lower conductivity than the hot-pressed KNN (as plotted in b). It would mean that although a larger/comparable d 33 can usually be realized in KNN produced with alternative techniques, such as hot pressing or spark plasma sintering , the higher concentration of intrinsic defects and, hence, increased conductivity make them unsuitable for high-temperature practical applications.

# TITLE
Water-mediated production of K<inf>0.5</inf>Na<inf>0.5</inf>NbO<inf>3</inf> piezoelectric ceramics with cold-sintering assisted route: Enhanced dielectric properties

# ABSTRACT
In this work, cold-sintering assisted production of KNN ceramics with water (no corrosive transient liquid) leads to a homogenous, high-density pure KNN with high dielectric permittivity and lower dielectric losses as compared to high-temperature sintering techniques.

# INTRODUCTION
As a candidate for replacement of hazardous lead-based piezoelectric materials, Potassium Sodium Niobate (KNN)-based materials have garnered significant attention for their enticing combination of high Curie temperature (T C ) and mechanical quality factor (Q m ). However, harnessing the functionality of this lead-free piezoelectric material remains a central focus, driven by various challenges encountered during the production of pure KNN. Notably, pure KNN exhibits a high leakage current and is particularly sensitive to processing conditions when subjected to high-temperature sintering. In the last decade, a novel densification approach was developed by using hydrothermal conditions, employing high pressure, moderate temperatures of about 300 \xb0C, and small additions of water. The significance of this so-called \u201cCold Sintering\u201d method becomes evident when considering the drawbacks of conventional or high-temperature sintering. The allure of highly dense pure KNN ceramics with reasonable properties has driven the exploration of the Cold Sintering (CS) approach. CS allows for low-temperature processing, which helps retain A-site stoichiometry by inhibiting alkali metal volatilization. This translates to typically faster processing times and lower energy consumption than conventional methods (778 kWh/kg) , with a very low energy consumption of 27 kWh/kg. In such systems, the major effect of a thermal post-treatment is the decomposition of carbides and hydroxides (Y(OH)3 forms as an unstable side product in sintering of BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-\u1e9f) and a re-formation of the perovskite phase from the remaining oxides, which in turn, results in enhanced chemical and phase homogenization. BZCY can be tuned through the phase composition of the starting powder. For BaZr0.7Ce0.2Y0.1O3-\u1e9f ceramics incomplete calcination allows (partial) solution and this would make reprecipitation easier. Only a few projects explored cold-sintered KNN systems and achieved satisfactory piezoelectric properties ; most have primarily focused on sintering conditions, such as temperature and the ratio of solvent to the green body , mainly overlooking the influence of calcination temperature. Prior studies for ceramics have underlined the significance of mixing, solid-state reactions, and the evolution of high crystallinity in conventionally sintered KNN. Thong et al. highlighted the role of calcination temperature, specifically around 1000 \xb0C, in achieving excellent piezoelectric properties in KNN powder. Therefore, a thorough investigation into the influence of the initial powder's characteristics is crucial for achieving good performance in cold-sintered KNN ceramics. This work is focused on investigating the cold-sintering process of KNN materials, assessing the structural properties of ceramics sintered with a cold-sintering assisted technique, and examining the effects of initial powder calcination temperatures. The CS process presented here involves only water as the transport phase, eliminating the need for the potentially corrosive NaOH + KOH transient flux mentioned in previous work. The electrical and electromechanical properties of KNN were investigated, and our results reveal that the suggested sintering route can realize improved piezoelectric properties.

# CONCLUSION
A new method was introduced for producing dense K0.5Na0.5NbO3 (KNN) ceramics using a cold-sintering-assisted process without the need for corrosive solvents. This study examined how calcined powders affect the performance of pure KNN ceramics, rationalizing that both powder size and crystallinity increase with higher calcination temperatures. The ceramics exhibited good ferroelectric and dielectric properties (with a d 33 value of 120 pC/N and d 33 * value of 248 pm/V), surpassing those typically achieved through high-temperature, pressure-assisted sintering techniques. While this study illustrates the process technique, it also opens avenues for enhancing the phase structure and electrical properties of KNN-based materials. Moreover, the role of dislocations in defect chemistry, and its interaction with 0D defects like intrinsic point defects, remains an area for further exploration.

This could be related to the nature of KNN, as the end member KNbO3 is one of the rare perovskite materials plastically deformable already at room temperature. One could consider the role of dislocations as 1D-defects and their contribution to electrical conductivity as a conductive and charge transport pathway or to large-signal piezoelectric coefficients or diffuse phase transition, where an increase in dislocation density may reduce the permittivity and cause a broadening of the phase transition region. Previous cold sintering approaches, using water as a liquid, yielded a density of only 85 % after annealing of 800 \xb0C for 2 h in air. Although ceramics prepared using KOH+NaOH (10 mol/L) could achieve densities above 95 % for KNN and BaTiO3 , the use of KOH+NaOH as the transient liquid can hinder industrial-scale production. In the cold-sintering assisted processes, stainless steel components such as punch, die, and cylinder are highly prone to corrosion, particularly at 300 \xb0C. Compared to previous work , in which it is claimed that post-annealing temperatures above 1000 \xb0C are necessary for the final densification of KNN, our investigation reveals that a high-density, pure KNN material can be successfully obtained through a CSA approach and subsequent O 2 annealing offering a promising avenue for sintering of pure and chemically-modified KNN. highlights a comparative view of the temperature-dependent dielectric permittivity and dielectric loss. Significantly, at room temperature, the relative permittivity of P-KNN-875 is observed to be the highest among the samples. However, there is no clear trend with increasing temperature as P-KNN-700 exhibits greater permittivity values compared to P-KNN-750. In this sequence, P-KNN-875 exhibits a higher permittivity than both P-KNN-700 and P-KNN-750, in descending order. The cold-sintered KNN ceramics exhibit a phase transition from orthorhombic to tetragonal (T O-T ) at 200 \xb0C. The Curie temperature T c is 410 \xb0C. Interestingly, the slightly higher T c observed in P-KNN-875 may be attributed to a subtle change in the lattice distortion , compositional fluctuations or due to a grain-size effect. In , the variations in permittivity (\u03b5\u2032 r ) with temperature are also depicted across different frequencies. At room temperature, the increased dielectric loss of P-KNN-700 and P-KNN-750 at low frequencies is evident. Meanwhile, a stable capacitance (C\u2019 P ) is observed for the P-KNN-875 sample. For P-KNN-700 and P-KNN-750 samples, leaky loops were discerned, indicative of a notable contribution from leakage current (a). Conversely, our large-signal data analysis reveals that the P-KNN-875 sample boasts well-defined ferroelectric polarization loops devoid of leakage with a saturated ferroelectric curve and a remnant polarization (P r ) of 26.7 \u03bcC/cm\xb2. This value surpasses the reported data for cold-sintered KNN ceramics in the literature. It is worth noting that pure KNN ceramics, in most cases, could not be densified through conventional sintering , thereby measuring a ferroelectric polarization loop was always challenging. Nevertheless, Haugen et al. reported that phase-pure KNN ceramic with a relative density of 94 % could only yield a remnant polarization of 9.8 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, which is significantly lower than that value of P-KNN-875. b shows the butterfly strain-electric field (S-E) curve for P-KNN-875 and P-KNN-700. For P-KNN-700, the significant differences between the samples were confirmed. Domain wall pinning by dislocation network has been observed for the BaTiO3 single crystals, where P r was hugely suppressed, and E c has been largely increased. Although high dislocation density exists in P-KNN-875, it seems that P r value is not noticeably affected by 1D defects, as P-KNN-875 still shows high Pr values similar to the highly dense hot-pressed KNN, where the sample was dislocation-free. Hence, the dislocation effect on KNN in the present study is not conclusive. Ultimately, a significant electromechanical response was observed for the sample when the calcining temperature increased to 875 \xb0C, as evidenced by the direct piezoelectric coefficient d 33 increase. This could be correlated with the highest permittivity and room temperature \u03b5 r (d 33\u221d \u03b5 r* P r/s) of this ceramic. For a more comprehensive perspective, unipolar strain measurements were conducted under a maximum electric field of 4 kV/mm (as depicted in c). These measurements revealed a significantly improved unipolar strain of 0.10 % within the P-KNN-875 ceramic, accompanied by an enhanced converse piezoelectric coefficient d 33 * value of 248 pm/V. This d 33 * value is 1.7 times higher than that of P-KNN-700 and P-KNN-750 ceramics. The pinnacle of these findings is the P-KNN-875 sample, showcasing the highest piezoelectric properties with a d 33 value of 120 pC/N and d 33 * value of 248 pm/V. These values could be particularly compared with KNN produced with other techniques. Regularly-sintered pure K0.5Na0.5NbO3 originally shows poor piezoelectric properties (d 33 \u223c 80\u2013100 pC/N) However, hot-pressed counterparts have been reported to have higher piezoelectric properties of d 33 = 141\u2013148 pC/N. To further evaluate the electrical properties of the ceramic samples, we conducted measurements of the frequency-dependent impedance across a temperature spectrum. displays the Nyquist plot of the complex resistance (Z\u2019-Z\u2019\u2019) at 400 \xb0C for all specimens. By investigating these two, measured data have been fitted using an equivalent circuit comprising one R-CPE-C (resistance-constant phase elements and capacitance). The semicircle with a capacitance range of 0.5 \xd7 10E^{\u201310} to 9 \xd7 10E^{\u201310} F can be observed within the measured frequency range (a), which can be correlated with the bulk ferroelectric response. Comparing the P-KNN-875 and P-KNN-750, we find a difference in the resistance values by a factor of 3  at 500 \xb0C. We noted differences between the samples\u2019 electrical conductivity with the help of Arrhenius plots (b). The activation energies (E a ) are determined to be 1.04\u20131.36 eV based on the slopes of fitting lines (b). Those extracted E a values are in the range of values reported for KNN and perovskite ceramics. When comparing ceramics, the changes in electrical conductivity and activation energy, then, could probably be rationalized through an intrinsic defect structure variation due to the unintentionally formed A-site vacancies and respective charge-compensating oxygen vacancies (V A \u2032 and V O \u2022\u2022) and holes h \u2022. The data were compared with hot-pressed pure KNN, shown by the solid line, which has comparable dielectric and electrochemical properties. The impedance results suggest that the current route eventually leads to a lower concentration of the intrinsic charge carriers and, subsequently, drastically lower conductivity than the hot-pressed KNN (as plotted in b). It would mean that although a larger/comparable d 33 can usually be realized in KNN produced with alternative techniques, such as hot pressing or spark plasma sintering , the higher concentration of intrinsic defects and, hence, increased conductivity make them unsuitable for high-temperature practical applications.

# TITLE
Water-mediated production of K<inf>0.5</inf>Na<inf>0.5</inf>NbO<inf>3</inf> piezoelectric ceramics with cold-sintering assisted route: Enhanced dielectric properties

# ABSTRACT
In this work, cold-sintering assisted production of KNN ceramics with water (no corrosive transient liquid) leads to a homogenous, high-density pure KNN with high dielectric permittivity and lower dielectric losses as compared to high-temperature sintering techniques.

# INTRODUCTION
As a candidate for replacement of hazardous lead-based piezoelectric materials, Potassium Sodium Niobate (KNN)-based materials have garnered significant attention for their enticing combination of high Curie temperature (T C ) and mechanical quality factor (Q m ). However, harnessing the functionality of this lead-free piezoelectric material remains a central focus, driven by various challenges encountered during the production of pure KNN. Notably, pure KNN exhibits a high leakage current and is particularly sensitive to processing conditions when subjected to high-temperature sintering. In the last decade, a novel densification approach was developed by using hydrothermal conditions, employing high pressure, moderate temperatures of about 300 \xb0C, and small additions of water. The significance of this so-called \u201cCold Sintering\u201d method becomes evident when considering the drawbacks of conventional or high-temperature sintering. The allure of highly dense pure KNN ceramics with reasonable properties has driven the exploration of the Cold Sintering (CS) approach. CS allows for low-temperature processing, which helps retain A-site stoichiometry by inhibiting alkali metal volatilization. This translates to typically faster processing times and lower energy consumption than conventional methods (778 kWh/kg) , with a very low energy consumption of 27 kWh/kg. In such systems, the major effect of a thermal post-treatment is the decomposition of carbides and hydroxides (Y(OH)3 forms as an unstable side product in sintering of BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-\u1e9f) and a re-formation of the perovskite phase from the remaining oxides, which in turn, results in enhanced chemical and phase homogenization. BZCY can be tuned through the phase composition of the starting powder. For BaZr0.7Ce0.2Y0.1O3-\u1e9f ceramics incomplete calcination allows (partial) solution and this would make reprecipitation easier. Only a few projects explored cold-sintered KNN systems and achieved satisfactory piezoelectric properties ; most have primarily focused on sintering conditions, such as temperature and the ratio of solvent to the green body , mainly overlooking the influence of calcination temperature. Prior studies for ceramics have underlined the significance of mixing, solid-state reactions, and the evolution of high crystallinity in conventionally sintered KNN. Thong et al. highlighted the role of calcination temperature, specifically around 1000 \xb0C, in achieving excellent piezoelectric properties in KNN powder. Therefore, a thorough investigation into the influence of the initial powder's characteristics is crucial for achieving good performance in cold-sintered KNN ceramics. This work is focused on investigating the cold-sintering process of KNN materials, assessing the structural properties of ceramics sintered with a cold-sintering assisted technique, and examining the effects of initial powder calcination temperatures. The CS process presented here involves only water as the transport phase, eliminating the need for the potentially corrosive NaOH + KOH transient flux mentioned in previous work. The electrical and electromechanical properties of KNN were investigated, and our results reveal that the suggested sintering route can realize improved piezoelectric properties.

# CONCLUSION
A new method was introduced for producing dense K0.5Na0.5NbO3 (KNN) ceramics using a cold-sintering-assisted process without the need for corrosive solvents. This study examined how calcined powders affect the performance of pure KNN ceramics, rationalizing that both powder size and crystallinity increase with higher calcination temperatures. The ceramics exhibited good ferroelectric and dielectric properties (with a d 33 value of 120 pC/N and d 33 * value of 248 pm/V), surpassing those typically achieved through high-temperature, pressure-assisted sintering techniques. While this study illustrates the process technique, it also opens avenues for enhancing the phase structure and electrical properties of KNN-based materials. Moreover, the role of dislocations in defect chemistry, and its interaction with 0D defects like intrinsic point defects, remains an area for further exploration.
