Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same.

**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'Flux growth', 'precursors': ['Bi2O3', 'Na2CO3', 'NaF', 'K2CO3', 'BaCO3', 'TiO2', 'Nb2O5'], 'steps': ['Precursor powders were prepared according to stoichiometric ratios.', 'Components were thoroughly mixed in ethanol via ball milling for 15 h.', 'After drying, the mixture was placed into a covered alumina crucible and calcined at 810 °C for 5 h to produce the precursor powders.', 'The mixture was heated to 1200 °C and slowly cooled to 850 °C to promote single crystal growth.', 'Cut crystal wafers were coated with silver paste and sintered at 850 °C for 30 min.', 'Poling was achieved by immersing the single crystals in silicone oil and applying a DC electric field of 40 kV/cm for 10 min at room temperature.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'Raman spectroscopy', 'PFM', 'Piezoelectric d33 meter', 'LCR meter', 'Ferroelectric test system']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
