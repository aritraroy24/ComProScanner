", agent="Synthesis Data Formatter", status="completed", output="Thought: The user wants to format the provided synthesis data.
I need to:
1.  Keep 'method' as 'Solid-state reaction' since no allowed entities are provided for 'methods'.
2.  Keep 'precursors' as they are: ['Bi2O3', 'TiO2', 'Na2CO3', 'MnO2', 'BaCO3', 'Fe2O3', 'polyvinyl alcohol'].
3.  Keep 'steps' as they are.
4.  Keep 'characterization_techniques' as they are since no allowed entities are provided for 'characterization_techniques'.

Therefore, I will return the dictionary with the original values for all fields.```json
