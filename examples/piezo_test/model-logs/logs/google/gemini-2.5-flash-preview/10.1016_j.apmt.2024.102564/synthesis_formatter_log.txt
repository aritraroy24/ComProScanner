Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'Solution Dropping and Solvent Removal', 'precursors': ['L-phenylalanyl-L-leucine', 'L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine', 'Methanol', 'Silicon substrate'], 'steps': ['Prepare a dipeptide solution in methanol (1 mg mL-1).', 'Drop 10 μL of the freshly prepared dipeptide solution onto the surface of a silicon substrate.', 'Remove the solvent using one of three methods: (1) spontaneous evaporation, (2) forced drying with warm air (45°C), or (3) spin-coating at 3000 rpm.', 'For saturation experiments, place a silicon substrate with a deposited dipeptide film in a Petri dish containing an organic solvent to create saturated vapor (P/P0=1).', 'Seal the Petri dish and keep it at room temperature for 10 minutes to 24 hours.', 'After saturation, dry the film with warm air (45°C).', 'Perform all experiments three times to ensure reproducibility and consistency of crystal growth.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRPD', 'Raman spectroscopy', 'AFM', 'PFM']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
