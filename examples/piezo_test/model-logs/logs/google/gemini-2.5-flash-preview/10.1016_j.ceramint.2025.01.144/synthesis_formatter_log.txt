", agent="Synthesis Data Formatter", status="completed", output="Thought: The user wants me to format the provided synthesis data.
I need to:
1.  Keep the 'method' as 'sol-gel' since no allowed entities for 'methods' are provided.
2.  Keep the 'precursors' as they are, as the instruction states "No need to change the 'steps' and 'precursors' values" in the initial prompt, and "Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified" in the detailed instructions.
3.  Keep the 'steps' as they are, as the instruction states "No need to change the 'steps' and 'precursors' values" in the initial prompt, and "Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified" in the detailed instructions.
4.  Keep the 'characterization_techniques' as they are, since no allowed entities for 'characterization_techniques' are provided.

Therefore, I will return the dictionary with the original values for all fields.```json
