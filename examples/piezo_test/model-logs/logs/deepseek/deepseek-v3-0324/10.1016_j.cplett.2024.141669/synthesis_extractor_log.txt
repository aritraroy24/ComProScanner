The phonon dispersion curves presented for \u03b1-TeO2 and \u03b2-TeO2 under 0 % and 2 % compressive strain in provide insight into their dynamic stability. For \u03b1-TeO2, the phonon dispersion at 0 % strain shows no imaginary frequencies, confirming that the material is dynamically stable in its unstrained state. Even when subjected to a 2 % compressive strain, the phonon bands remain free of any imaginary modes, indicating that the \u03b1-TeO2 structure retains its dynamic stability under compression. Similarly, \u03b2-TeO2 displays stable phonon behavior at 0 % strain, with no signs of instability across the Brillouin zone. Under 2 % compressive strain, the phonon dispersion continues to exhibit real frequencies throughout, suggesting that \u03b2-TeO2 is also dynamically stable under this strain. The tetragonal P41212 \u03b1-TeO2 structure is composed of a helical-type structure of corner-sharing TeO4 wedge-shaped disphenoids along the z-direction as depicted in (a). The \u03b2-TeO2 structure also contains a disphenoid structure, but here these are edge-sharing disphenoid layers rather than corner-sharing as displayed in (b). The distinction between these structures stems from the length of Te\u2013O bonds. In \u03b1-TeO2, each disphenoid has two longer axial and two shorter equatorial Te\u2013O bonds (second panel of (a)), while in the case of \u03b2-TeO2, each Te\u2013O bond the disphenoid has a different bond length (second panel of (b)). For \u03b1-TeO2, the a and b lattice parameters are somewhat similar to experimental lattice parameters. This could be due to the addition of van der Waals corrections in \u03b1-TeO2 with the fact that the chains are along the c-direction, the side chain interactions in the ab-plane are corrected while the c parameter is reduced. Similarly, the van der Waals corrections were added to \u03b2-TeO2 calculations to accommodate the weak interactions between TeO4 disphenoid layers which caused the computed values to slightly deviate from the experimental ones. The overall differences between the experimental and our calculated values are below 5 % which establishes the reliability of our calculations. The electronic bandstructure of \u03b1-TeO2 and \u03b2-TeO2 at ambient strain conditions plotted along high symmetry paths of the Brillouin zone are given in (a) and (b), respectively. \u03b1-TeO2 is an indirect band wideband semiconductor with a bandgap value of 3.64 eV as indicated on the graph. For example, Ngyuen et. al reported experimental and theoretical values of \u03b1-TeO2 to be 3.45 eV and 3.585 eV, respectively. The experimental bandgap value of TeO2 determined via UV\u2013Vis absorption by Santos et. al was 3.43 eV. The total as well as element-resolved PDOS for \u03b1-TeO2 as plotted in (c) indicate that the upper edge of the valence band (VB) is mainly formed mainly by O-2p states with equal contributions from the Te-5p and Te-5s states. On the other hand, the lower edge of the conduction band (CB) is formed mainly by Te-5p states with minor contributions from O-2p states. To describe the optical properties of a medium at all photon energies, the complex dielectric function is defined as \u03b5* = \u03b5\u2032 + \u03b5\u2033 where the dielectric real part \u03b5\u2032 describes the polarization caused by the incident electromagnetic radiation while the imaginary part \u03b5\u2033 represents energy dissipation. One can define the complex refractive index n \u2217 in terms of \u03b5\u2032 (\u03c9) and \u03b5\u2033(\u03c9) by using n \u2217 \u03c9=n \u03c9+i\u03ba \u03c9 where n \u03c9 and \u03ba \u03c9 are the experimentally measurable refractive index (related to the speed of the incident radiation), and extinction coefficient (related to the intensity decay during the propagation of radiation), respectively. The n \u03c9 and \u03ba \u03c9 are, thus, defined as: From these equations, the optical absorption function \u03b1 \u03c9 is defined as where \u03bb is the wavelength of light and it offers an estimate of a material\u2019s light absorption capability. (e) displays the optical absorption versus incident photon energy plots along three mutually perpendicular directions [100], [010], and [001]. The absorption curve shows an increase in absorption coefficient beyond 3.6 eV, confirming that photons with energies above this threshold can excite electrons across the bandgap. As seen in the figure, the absorption profiles are the same in [100] and [010] directions while it is substantially different in [001] direction, indicating anisotropy in the absorption. This anisotropy is a characteristic feature of the tetragonal P41212 space group in which the properties are expected to be isotropic within the x-y plane but not in the perpendicular z-direction. The \u03b2-TeO2 band structure in (b) indicates that it is a direct bandgap semiconductor with a bandgap of 3.62 eV. This bandgap value is in the vicinity of recently obtained experimental and theoretical values of 3.7 eV obtained by Shi et. al and Zavabeti et. al. , thereby confirming the accuracy of the current calculations. The density of states plots for \u03b2-TeO2 are given in (d) where one witnesses that the upper edge of VB is hugely dominated by O-2p states with minor contribution from Te-5s states. The lower edge of CB is dominated by Te-5p states small contribution from O-2p states. The optical absorption spectra of \u03b2-TeO2 are plotted in (f) along three mutually perpendicular directions. Similar to \u03b1-TeO2, the optical absorption is driven by electronic transitions between O-2p states in the valence band and Te-5p states in the conduction band. The absorption in \u03b2-TeO2 also shows pronounced anisotropy, as indicated by the distinct absorption curves for different crystallographic directions. The varying absorption intensities across three directions indicate that \u03b2-TeO2 has more pronounced directional dependencies in its optical properties than \u03b1-TeO2. The first absorption peak occurs slightly above the band gap energy of 3.632 eV, corresponding to the onset of allowed electronic transitions from the VBM to CBM. The second absorption peak of \u03b2-TeO2 reflects more complex transitions beyond the fundamental bandgap, involving states from the valence band that are further below the Fermi level (likely involving O-2p states) and higher-lying Te-5p states in the conduction band. This results in higher-energy photon absorption and gives rise to the peak around 4.5 eV in the spectrum. The effect of compressive strain in the range of 0 \u2013 2 % on structural and bandgap values is displayed in (a). The bandgap variation with compression is distinct in each case of \u03b1-TeO2 and \u03b2-TeO2. The bandgap values of \u03b1-TeO2 increase from 3.64 (at 0 strain) to 3.70 eV at 2 % strain. On the other hand, the bandgap decreased for \u03b2-TeO2 from 3.632 to 3.53 eV in the above-mentioned strain range. More precisely, all lattice parameters of \u03b1-TeO2 decrease linearly and at the same rate as the applied strain is increased. For \u03b2-TeO2, although all parameters decrease with increasing pressure, the variation rate is not the same for all. As indicated earlier, there are two types of unequal bond lengths in \u03b1-TeO2, i.e. axial and equatorial ones, and their variation as functions of compression are plotted in (b). On the other hand, for \u03b2-TeO2, there are four unequal bonds, out of which two (Te\u2013O1 and Te\u2013O2) increase with increasing compressions ((d)) while the remaining two (Te\u2013O3 and Te\u2013O4) decrease with increasing compressions ((f)). To understand the effect of strain variation, we next study the element-resolved PDOS for each polymorph. The strain vs PDOS variation of \u03b1-TeO2 and \u03b2-TeO2 are given in (a \u2013 f). The panels (a) and (b) give the PDOS of oxygen 2p states of each polymorph. We have already described that the O-2p states are major contributors near the E=0 VB edge. On the other hand, the O-2p states near the lower edge of CB shift to higher energies with increasing compressive strain, and the peak height slightly decreases. Interestingly, the exact same behavior is mimicked by the Te-5p states near the lower edge of CB ((c)), except that peak height remains almost constant. The least contributing states, the Te-5s states also duplicate the behavior of O-2p and Te-5p states near the CB edge, with a slight increase in their peak heights ((e)). Thus, we can conclude from the DOS analysis of \u03b1-TeO2 that the gap between lower energy and high energy features increases across the bandgap, thereby increasing the bandgap value of \u03b1-TeO2. The change in PDOS of \u03b2-TeO2 with strain variation is not as regular as that of \u03b1-TeO2. The low energy end O-2p PDOS shifts abruptly to lower energy after 0.4 % strain and then remains almost constant afterward. On the other hand, the high energy O-2p PDOS shifts to lower energies more dramatically for compressions greater than 0.4 % and remains almost constant for greater compression values. Similar shifting behavior was found in the case of Te-5p states for states near the CB edge and the appearance of some states within the bandgap is evident in (d). Since Te-5p states are responsible for CB lower edge formation, the decrease in bandgap can be attributed to the above-described PDOS behavior. A similar shift of PDOS was also found for Te-5s states but their contribution to the total DOS is negligible. The optical absorption \u03b1 \u03c9 was obtained from real and imaginary parts of the optical dielectric function (\u03b5' and \u03b5'' using Eq. ): Firstly, it is required to be established that due to tetragonal and orthorhombic symmetries of \u03b1-TeO2 and \u03b2-TeO2, the optical absorption spectra are anisotropic. The optical absorption spectra of \u03b1-TeO2 are isotropic in [100] and [010] directions, but not in [001] direction. On the other hand, the absorption spectra of \u03b2-TeO2 display trends consistent with the PDOS plots. The absorption plots show a slight shift of the lower absorption edge with increasing compression until 0.4 %. However, at reaching 0.8 % compression, there are sudden and huge shifts of the absorption edge to the lower energies as displayed in (b), (d), and (f), the change in [010] direction is the highest. Thus, it can be concluded that the small compressions change the value of the absorption edge in a regular manner for \u03b1-TeO2 while the changes are more abrupt for \u03b2-TeO2. Therefore, a small compressive strain is a good tool to control the optical properties of \u03b1-TeO2. Linear refractive index n was also calculated at all energies for both polymorphs and their standard values (effective polycrystalline limit) at 633 nm (1.95 eV) and their values as functions of applied compression are given in. The values at 0 % strain are comparable to those reported by earlier studies. Thus, again, compressive strain proves to be excellent in tuning this optical feature of both polymorphs of TeO2. As discussed in the introduction section, the term P= \u03c7 ijk 2 Ej Ek represents the optical nonlinearity effects and the \u03c7 ijk 2 is the nonlinear second-order third-rank optical susceptibility tensor. It is to be noted here that second-order nonlinear optical interactions can occur only in noncentrosymmetric crystals\u2014that is, in crystals that do not display inversion symmetry. Considering nonlinear \u03c7 ijk 2, it is useful to discuss some particular cases of frequency conversion, i.e. converting from frequencies \u03c9n and \u03c9m to frequencies \u03c9n+ \u03c9m (including negative frequencies). For example, the second harmonic generation corresponds to \u03c7 ijk 2 2\u03c9,\u03c9,\u03c9, optical rectification to \u03c7 ijk 2 0,\u03c9,-\u03c9, and difference in frequency generation to \u03c7 ijk 2 \u03c91- \u03c92, \u03c91, \u03c92. For the most general case when all frequencies are different: \u03c93= \u03c91+ \u03c92, there are 12 such tensors (considering both positive and negative values) with 27 permutations of each, making an overall 12 \xd7 27 = 324 complex tensors. However, due to the restrictions of real electric field values, permutation symmetry, lossless medium, and the Kleinman symmetry approximation (valid within near infra-red-visible frequency range), the tensors are reduced to 18 components only given by Eq.. It is usually convenient to use contracted notation of tensor components And if the Kleinman symmetry is valid, some of these 18 components turn out to be equal, we find that there are only 10 components of the tensor as given in Equation. In our case, the values of \u03c7 ijk 2 for pristine \u03b1-TeO2 are: The diagonal elements of the matrix \u03c7 ijk 2 matrix (d11, d22, and d33) represent the polarization responses of the crystal in the same direction as the applied electric field. The calculated values are d11= \u22120.00347 pm/V, d22= \u22120.00394 pm/V, and d33= \u22120.00699 pm/V indicates that the polarization response is stronger along the z-axis compared to the x and y axes. Significant off-diagonal values include d12 = \u2212 0.00022 pm/V and d13 = 0.00069 pm/V indicates the coupling between different polarization components. Overall, the nonlinear optical susceptibility values for the tetragonal \u03b1-TeO2 crystal reveal an anisotropic response with significant nonlinear effects along the principal axes. The values of \u03c7 ijk 2 for pristine \u03b2-TeO2 are given by: The diagonal elements of the matrix \u03c7 ijk 2 matrix are d11 \u200b= \u22120.00504 pm/V, \u200bd22 = 0.00729 pm/V, andd33 = 0.00021 pm/V indicate that the polarization response is anisotropic. The off-diagonal elements of the \u03c7 ijk 2 matrix (e.g., d12 = 0.00310 pm/V, d14= 0.00004 pm/V, and d16 = 0.00881 pm/V) highlight the complex interactions within the crystal, contributing to its overall nonlinear optical behavior. The anisotropic nature of the nonlinear optical susceptibility in Pbca of \u03b2-TeO2 crystals makes them suitable for applications in frequency doubling and other nonlinear optical processes. The large d16 value of 0.00881 pm/V, in particular, suggests that the crystal is highly efficient for second-harmonic generation (SHG). It is to be mentioned here that no previous DFT studies have reported non-zero \u03c7 ijk 2 values of \u03b1-TeO2, as pointed out by Berkaine et al. , however, experimentally obtained values of the order of 0 \u2013 5 pm/V were obtained for some tellurite glasses. Now let\u2019s discuss the effect of compressive strain on the nonlinear susceptibility components of both \u03b1-TeO2 and \u03b2-TeO2 as displayed in (a) and (b). For \u03b1-TeO2 ((a)), the components d15 and d33 are enhanced significantly, while the values of d24 and d22 are slightly decreased with increasing strain. In the case of \u03b2-TeO2, several of the component values are enhanced upon increasing strain e.g. the magnitudes of d11, d12, d13, d16, and d22 are enhanced as displayed in (b). Thus, it is pertinent to conclude this section with the result that the applied compressive strain significantly affects the components of the nonlinear susceptibility tensor of both polymorphs of TeO2. However, the enhancement of components of \u03b2-TeO2 is more pronounced in terms of a number of components as well their enhancements of magnitudes. The high-frequency polarizability tensor components of \u03b1-TeO2 are given below in Equation showing that only diagonal components are non-zero. These values of polarizability are comparable with previous experimental and DFT calculated values. \u03b1 xx and \u03b1 yy are equal, reflecting the tetragonal symmetry. Moreover, the \u03b1 zz has a much higher value showing that material is more polarizable in this direction. Also, for \u03b2-TeO2, only diagonal elements are non-zero, however, all have different values, reflecting the orthorhombic symmetry. Also, the highest value belongs to \u03b1 yy while the lowest to that of \u03b1 zz. The effect of compressive strain on \u03b1 ij of \u03b1-TeO2 is plotted in (a) where we notice that all non-zero tensor component values decrease with increasing strain from 0 to 2 %. On the other hand, all tensor components of \u03b2-TeO2 ( (b)) show appreciation in their values with increasing strain. Since high-frequency polarizability is responsible for the refractive index of a material, therefore, we see that \u03b2-TeO2 has better refractive index values in all directions than those of the \u03b1-TeO2. Also, increasing compression enhances the refractive index values even further for the \u03b2-TeO2. Born effective charges (BECs) provide insights into the dynamic response of a material's ions to an electric field. In materials like tetragonal \u03b1-TeO2, variations in Born effective charges under different compressive strains provide insights into the material's electronic structure and polarization behavior, which are essential for optimizing its performance in electronic and optoelectronic applications. The variation of BECs of various atoms for tetragonal \u03b1-TeO2 and orthorhombic \u03b2-TeO2 are consolidated in and , respectively. The diagonal elements of BECs for every atom in each case show enhancements in their magnitudes with increased strains while the off-diagonal elements do not depict any particular trend with increasing strain. Therefore, it can be concluded that small compressive strains may prove to be excellent tools for optimizing the dielectric and piezoelectric properties of both polymorphs of TeO2.

The electronic bandstructure of \u03b1-TeO2 and \u03b2-TeO2 at ambient strain conditions plotted along high symmetry paths of the Brillouin zone are given in (a) and (b), respectively. \u03b1-TeO2 is an indirect band wideband semiconductor with a bandgap value of 3.64 eV as indicated on the graph.

The n \u03c9 and \u03ba \u03c9 are, thus, defined as: From these equations, the optical absorption function \u03b1 \u03c9 is defined as where \u03bb is the wavelength of light and it offers an estimate of a material\u2019s light absorption capability. (e) displays the optical absorption versus incident photon energy plots along three mutually perpendicular directions [100], [010], and [001]. The absorption curve shows an increase in absorption coefficient beyond 3.6 eV, confirming that photons with energies above this threshold can excite electrons across the bandgap. As seen in the figure, the absorption profiles are the same in [100] and [010] directions while it is substantially different in [001] direction, indicating anisotropy in the absorption. This anisotropy is a characteristic feature of the tetragonal P41212 space group in which the properties are expected to be isotropic within the x-y plane but not in the perpendicular z-direction.

This bandgap value is in the vicinity of recently obtained experimental and theoretical values of 3.7 eV obtained by Shi et. al and Zavabeti et. al. , thereby confirming the accuracy of the current calculations. The density of states plots for \u03b2-TeO2 are given in (d) where one witnesses that the upper edge of VB is hugely dominated by O-2p states with minor contribution from Te-5s states. The lower edge of CB is dominated by Te-5p states small contribution from O-2p states. The optical absorption spectra of \u03b2-TeO2 are plotted in (f) along three mutually perpendicular directions. Similar to \u03b1-TeO2, the optical absorption is driven by electronic transitions between O-2p states in the valence band and Te-5p states in the conduction band. The absorption in \u03b2-TeO2 also shows pronounced anisotropy, as indicated by the distinct absorption curves for different crystallographic directions. The varying absorption intensities across three directions indicate that \u03b2-TeO2 has more pronounced directional dependencies in its optical properties than \u03b1-TeO2. The first absorption peak occurs slightly above the band gap energy of 3.632 eV, corresponding to the onset of allowed electronic transitions from the VBM to CBM. The second absorption peak of \u03b2-TeO2 reflects more complex transitions beyond the fundamental bandgap, involving states from the valence band that are further below the Fermi level (likely involving O-2p states) and higher-lying Te-5p states in the conduction band. This results in higher-energy photon absorption and gives rise to the peak around 4.5 eV in the spectrum. The effect of compressive strain in the range of 0 \u2013 2 % on structural and bandgap values is displayed in (a). The bandgap variation with compression is distinct in each case of \u03b1-TeO2 and \u03b2-TeO2. The bandgap values of \u03b1-TeO2 increase from 3.64 (at 0 strain) to 3.70 eV at 2 % strain. On the other hand, the bandgap decreased for \u03b2-TeO2 from 3.632 to 3.53 eV in the above-mentioned strain range. More precisely, all lattice parameters of \u03b1-TeO2 decrease linearly and at the same rate as the applied strain is increased. For \u03b2-TeO2, although all parameters decrease with increasing pressure, the variation rate is not the same for all. As indicated earlier, there are two types of unequal bond lengths in \u03b1-TeO2, i.e. axial and equatorial ones, and their variation as functions of compression are plotted in (b). On the other hand, for \u03b2-TeO2, there are four unequal bonds, out of which two (Te\u2013O1 and Te\u2013O2) increase with increasing compressions ((d)) while the remaining two (Te\u2013O3 and Te\u2013O4) decrease with increasing compressions ((f)). To understand the effect of strain variation, we next study the element-resolved PDOS for each polymorph. The strain vs PDOS variation of \u03b1-TeO2 and \u03b2-TeO2 are given in (a \u2013 f). The panels (a) and (b) give the PDOS of oxygen 2p states of each polymorph. We have already described that the O-2p states are major contributors near the E=0 VB edge. On the other hand, the O-2p states near the lower edge of CB shift to higher energies with increasing compressive strain, and the peak height slightly decreases. Interestingly, the exact same behavior is mimicked by the Te-5p states near the lower edge of CB ((c)), except that peak height remains almost constant. The least contributing states, the Te-5s states also duplicate the behavior of O-2p and Te-5p states near the CB edge, with a slight increase in their peak heights ((e)). Thus, we can conclude from the DOS analysis of \u03b1-TeO2 that the gap between lower energy and high energy features increases across the bandgap, thereby increasing the bandgap value of \u03b1-TeO2. The change in PDOS of \u03b2-TeO2 with strain variation is not as regular as that of \u03b1-TeO2. The low energy end O-2p PDOS shifts abruptly to lower energy after 0.4 % strain and then remains almost constant afterward. On the other hand, the high energy O-2p PDOS shifts to lower energies more dramatically for compressions greater than 0.4 % and remains almost constant for greater compression values. Similar shifting behavior was found in the case of Te-5p states for states near the CB edge and the appearance of some states within the bandgap is evident in (d). Since Te-5p states are responsible for CB lower edge formation, the decrease in bandgap can be attributed to the above-described PDOS behavior. A similar shift of PDOS was also found for Te-5s states but their contribution to the total DOS is negligible. The optical absorption \u03b1 \u03c9 was obtained from real and imaginary parts of the optical dielectric function (\u03b5' and \u03b5'' using Eq. ): Firstly, it is required to be established that due to tetragonal and orthorhombic symmetries of \u03b1-TeO2 and \u03b2-TeO2, the optical absorption spectra are anisotropic. The optical absorption spectra of \u03b1-TeO2 are isotropic in [100] and [010] directions, but not in [001] direction. On the other hand, the absorption spectra of \u03b2-TeO2 display trends consistent with the PDOS plots. The absorption plots show a slight shift of the lower absorption edge with increasing compression until 0.4 %. However, at reaching 0.8 % compression, there are sudden and huge shifts of the absorption edge to the lower energies as displayed in (b), (d), and (f), the change in [010] direction is the highest. Thus, it can be concluded that the small compressions change the value of the absorption edge in a regular manner for \u03b1-TeO2 while the changes are more abrupt for \u03b2-TeO2. Therefore, a small compressive strain is a good tool to control the optical properties of \u03b1-TeO2. Linear refractive index n was also calculated at all energies for both polymorphs and their standard values (effective polycrystalline limit) at 633 nm (1.95 eV) and their values as functions of applied compression are given in. The values at 0 % strain are comparable to those reported by earlier studies. Thus, again, compressive strain proves to be excellent in tuning this optical feature of both polymorphs of TeO2. As discussed in the introduction section, the term P= \u03c7 ijk 2 Ej Ek represents the optical nonlinearity effects and the \u03c7 ijk 2 is the nonlinear second-order third-rank optical susceptibility tensor. It is to be noted here that second-order nonlinear optical interactions can occur only in noncentrosymmetric crystals\u2014that is, in crystals that do not display inversion symmetry. Considering nonlinear \u03c7 ijk 2, it is useful to discuss some particular cases of frequency conversion, i.e. converting from frequencies \u03c9n and \u03c9m to frequencies \u03c9n+ \u03c9m (including negative frequencies). For example, the second harmonic generation corresponds to \u03c7 ijk 2 2\u03c9,\u03c9,\u03c9, optical rectification to \u03c7 ijk 2 0,\u03c9,-\u03c9, and difference in frequency generation to \u03c7 ijk 2 \u03c91- \u03c92, \u03c91, \u03c92. For the most general case when all frequencies are different: \u03c93= \u03c91+ \u03c92, there are 12 such tensors (considering both positive and negative values) with 27 permutations of each, making an overall 12 \xd7 27 = 324 complex tensors. However, due to the restrictions of real electric field values, permutation symmetry, lossless medium, and the Kleinman symmetry approximation (valid within near infra-red-visible frequency range), the tensors are reduced to 18 components only given by Eq.. It is usually convenient to use contracted notation of tensor components And if the Kleinman symmetry is valid, some of these 18 components turn out to be equal, we find that there are only 10 components of the tensor as given in Equation. In our case, the values of \u03c7 ijk 2 for pristine \u03b1-TeO2 are: The diagonal elements of the matrix \u03c7 ijk 2 matrix (d11, d22, and d33) represent the polarization responses of the crystal in the same direction as the applied electric field. The calculated values are d11= \u22120.00347 pm/V, d22= \u22120.00394 pm/V, and d33= \u22120.00699 pm/V indicates that the polarization response is stronger along the z-axis compared to the x and y axes. Significant off-diagonal values include d12 = \u2212 0.00022 pm/V and d13 = 0.00069 pm/V indicates the coupling between different polarization components. Overall, the nonlinear optical susceptibility values for the tetragonal \u03b1-TeO2 crystal reveal an anisotropic response with significant nonlinear effects along the principal axes. The values of \u03c7 ijk 2 for pristine \u03b2-TeO2 are given by: The diagonal elements of the matrix \u03c7 ijk 2 matrix are d11 \u200b= \u22120.00504 pm/V, \u200bd22 = 0.00729 pm/V, andd33 = 0.00021 pm/V indicate that the polarization response is anisotropic. The off-diagonal elements of the \u03c7 ijk 2 matrix (e.g., d12 = 0.00310 pm/V, d14= 0.00004 pm/V, and d16 = 0.00881 pm/V) highlight the complex interactions within the crystal, contributing to its overall nonlinear optical behavior. The anisotropic nature of the nonlinear optical susceptibility in Pbca of \u03b2-TeO2 crystals makes them suitable for applications in frequency doubling and other nonlinear optical processes. The large d16 value of 0.00881 pm/V, in particular, suggests that the crystal is highly efficient for second-harmonic generation (SHG). It is to be mentioned here that no previous DFT studies have reported non-zero \u03c7 ijk 2 values of \u03b1-TeO2, as pointed out by Berkaine et al. , however, experimentally obtained values of the order of 0 \u2013 5 pm/V were obtained for some tellurite glasses. Now let\u2019s discuss the effect of compressive strain on the nonlinear susceptibility components of both \u03b1-TeO2 and \u03b2-TeO2 as displayed in (a) and (b). For \u03b1-TeO2 ((a)), the components d15 and d33 are enhanced significantly, while the values of d24 and d22 are slightly decreased with increasing strain. In the case of \u03b2-TeO2, several of the component values are enhanced upon increasing strain e.g. the magnitudes of d11, d12, d13, d16, and d22 are enhanced as displayed in (b). Thus, it is pertinent to conclude this section with the result that the applied compressive strain significantly affects the components of the nonlinear susceptibility tensor of both polymorphs of TeO2. However, the enhancement of components of \u03b2-TeO2 is more pronounced in terms of a number of components as well their enhancements of magnitudes. The high-frequency polarizability tensor components of \u03b1-TeO2 are given below in Equation showing that only diagonal components are non-zero. These values of polarizability are comparable with previous experimental and DFT calculated values. \u03b1 xx and \u03b1 yy are equal, reflecting the tetragonal symmetry. Moreover, the \u03b1 zz has a much higher value showing that material is more polarizable in this direction. Also, for \u03b2-TeO2, only diagonal elements are non-zero, however, all have different values, reflecting the orthorhombic symmetry. Also, the highest value belongs to \u03b1 yy while the lowest to that of \u03b1 zz. The effect of compressive strain on \u03b1 ij of \u03b1-TeO2 is plotted in (a) where we notice that all non-zero tensor component values decrease with increasing strain from 0 to 2 %. On the other hand, all tensor components of \u03b2-TeO2 ( (b)) show appreciation in their values with increasing strain. Since high-frequency polarizability is responsible for the refractive index of a material, therefore, we see that \u03b2-TeO2 has better refractive index values in all directions than those of the \u03b1-TeO2. Also, increasing compression enhances the refractive index values even further for the \u03b2-TeO2. Born effective charges (BECs) provide insights into the dynamic response of a material's ions to an electric field. In materials like tetragonal \u03b1-TeO2, variations in Born effective charges under different compressive strains provide insights into the material's electronic structure and polarization behavior, which are essential for optimizing its performance in electronic and optoelectronic applications. The variation of BECs of various atoms for tetragonal \u03b1-TeO2 and orthorhombic \u03b2-TeO2 are consolidated in and , respectively. The diagonal elements of BECs for every atom in each case show enhancements in their magnitudes with increased strains while the off-diagonal elements do not depict any particular trend with increasing strain. Therefore, it can be concluded that small compressive strains may prove to be excellent tools for optimizing the dielectric and piezoelectric properties of both polymorphs of TeO2.
