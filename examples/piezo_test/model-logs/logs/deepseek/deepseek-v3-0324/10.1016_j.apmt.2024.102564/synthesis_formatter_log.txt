Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'spin-coating, spontaneous evaporation, forced drying', 'precursors': ['L-phenylalanyl-L-leucine', 'L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine', 'methanol'], 'steps': ['Dropping 10 μL of a freshly prepared dipeptide solution in methanol (1 mg mL⁻¹) on the surface of a silicon substrate', 'Removing the solvent by spontaneous evaporation, forced drying with warm air, or spin-coating at 3000 rpm', 'Placing the silicon substrate with deposited dipeptide film in a Petri dish containing methanol to create saturated vapor (P/P₀=1)', 'Sealing the Petri dish and keeping it from 10 minutes to 24 hours at room temperature', 'Drying the film with warm air (45°C)'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRPD', 'Raman spectroscopy', 'AFM', 'PFM']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
