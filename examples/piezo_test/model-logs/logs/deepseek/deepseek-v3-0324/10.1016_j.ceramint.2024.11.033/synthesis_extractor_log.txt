The substrate material used in this study is pure Mg (Mg > 99.95 wt%, Fe < 0.007 wt%, Al < 0.008 wt%, Mn < 0.005 wt%, provided by Suzhou JingJun New Materials Technology Co. Pure Mg was selected since our previous research experience can provide guidance for analyzing the growth process of PEO coatings. The sample size is 30 mm \xd7 15 mm \xd7 2 mm. The samples were mechanically ground with SiC paper up to 1000 grit, ultrasonically cleaned in ethyl alcohol, and then dried in the cold air before preparing PEO coatings. During the PEO process, Mg plates were used as the anode, and a stainless steel chamber was used as the cathode and reactor. The pulse reverse power provided a constant current of 2 A/dmE^{2} for 660 s under the frequency of 500 Hz and a duty cycle of 15 %. The electrolyte was prepared based on silicate salt (20 g/L Na2SiO3 + 4 g/L KF + 2 g/L NaOH). The BaTiO3 content in the PEO coating is controlled by the concentration of BaTiO3 powder (Macklin, China, 99.9 %, globular, 100\u2013200 nm) added to the electrolyte. The microstructural properties of applied BaTiO3 powder are shown in. PEO represents the PEO coating prepared without BaTiO3. PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 represents the PEO coating prepared in the electrolyte containing 2 g/L and 5 g/L BaTiO3 (Such concentration was selected by considering the doping amount of BaTiO3 in the PEO coating and the normal growth of the PEO coating). The solution was cooled down using a water-cooling system at 30 \xb1 5 \xb0C during the coating process. After PEO treatment the samples were rinsed in distilled water and dried in warm air. The microstructures and compositions of coatings were characterized with FEI Sirion 200 scanning electron microscope (SEM, Nova Nano SEM 450, FEI, America) equipped with an attached Oxford EDS detector (EDS, Oxford X-Max, FEI, America). The cross sections of the PEO-treated samples were cut, mounted in epoxy resin, and polished. X-ray diffractometer (PHILIPS, PW 1700, with a nickel-filtered Cu K\u03b1 radiation, and \u03bb = 0.154059 nm, Brucker, German) operating at 40 kV and 30 mA was used to analyze the different phases in the coatings. The chemical properties of coatings were characterized with attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR, Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS10, Thermo Scientific, America). The d33 value of all samples were measured with a Dielectric and Ferroelectric Testing System (ZJ-3, Jin Ke Zhi Chuang, China). Electric hysteresis loops of all samples under 1 Hz scanning from \u221220 V to 20 V with a scan rate of 0.1 V/s were measured using a ferroelectric tester (Precision LC II, Radiant Technology, Inc, USA.). The coating-substrate bonding strength was evaluated by an automatic pulling-off adhesion tester (BEVS 2201, provided by Guangzhou Shenghua Industrial Co., Ltd.). The pulling rate was 0.5 MPa sE^{\u22121}, and the contact area between was 49\u03c0 mmE^{2} (\u03a6 = 14 mm). The hardness of coatings was tested by the automatic microhardness measurement system (model: FM-700). The measurement interval is 0.2 mm, the applied load is 300 g, and the holding time is 20 s. The Luria-Bertani lysogeny broth (LB culture) was used for preparing bacterial suspension with the concentration of (1\u201310) \xd7 10E^{5} CFU/mL. The coated samples were sterilized and co-cultured with bacterial suspension for 24 h with and without the UV irradiation. After co-culturing 100 \u03bcL suspension was taken from each well to dilute by adding 900 \u03bcL LB culture, then 100 \u03bcL of suspension was spread onto the agar plates and incubated at 37 \xb0C for 24 h. All of the co-culturing suspension was collected and injected into a 96 well cell culture plate for measuring its OD value at 600 nm which represents the bacterial concentration on a microplate reader (MK3, Thermo, America). The co-culturing samples were cleaned and fixed in a 4 % glutaraldehyde solution. The sequential dehydration was achieved by immersing samples in ethanol solutions of different concentrations, which was finally dried prior to SEM observation. The coated samples were immersed in stirring 5 mg/L solutions of Rhodamine B or Methyl Blue. A UV (Ultraviolet) lamp with a power of 0.1 W/cmE^{2} was used to irradiate the dye solution containing coated sample for 3 h, 6 h and 9 h (9 h is the complete degradation time of dyes in some experimental groups), respectively. Afterwards, a UV spectrophotometer (F-7000, Hitachi, Japan) was used to detect the extracted dye solution for characterizing the antifouling performance of coatings. The degradation rate of dyes can be determined based on Lambert Beer's law : where A represents the absorption peak intensity at 554 nm and 664 nm (the main absorption band center of Rhodamine B and Methyl Blue). The degradation efficiency of the dye solution is defined as C/C0, where C0 and C represent the initial and actual concentrations of the dye after different durations of UV irradiation, respectively. Each sample was immersed into the LB culture for 24 h. The culture was removed and collected every 4 h during the last immersion period, followed by the addition of the fresh culture. An inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-OES, Thermo Scientific iCP 6500) was used to measure the concentrations of MgE^{2+} and BaE^{2+} respectively. Meanwhile, the pH value of the collected solution was measured in this study by a pH meter (PHS-3E, REX). The ROS generation ability of all samples was investigated. Terephthalic acid (TA) and 1, 3-diphenyl isobenzofuran (DPBF) were used as probing molecules for \u2022OH and \u2022O2. All samples were immersed in TA solution or DPBF solution under the ultraviolet irradiation. Afterwards, the spectral measurement (350\u2013600 nm) was subjected to using an excitation wavelength of 325 nm under a fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-7000, Hitachi, Japan). The Ultraviolet absorption spectrum (250\u2013600 nm) of the solution was measured by an ultraviolet spectrophotometer (Cary 5000, Agilent, Japan). The 3.5 wt% NaCl solution was used to distinguish the difference of corrosion resistance between different samples. The immersion tests were carried out by immersing coated samples in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution under a constant temperature (30 \xb1 1 \xb0C) maintaining solution volume to the surface area as 50 mL/cmE^{2}. The experiment was maintained for 15 d (Damage caused by corrosion appeared on all samples surfaces). The immersion solution was replaced per 24 h to stabilize its pH value at 7 \xb1 0.1. The evolved H2 was collected using inverted funnel and burette. Electrochemical tests were conducted in a 3.5 wt% NaCl solution at 30 \xb1 0.5 \xb0C by using an electrochemical workstation (PARSTAT 3000A-DX, Ametek, America). OCP was measured for 1 h until it was stable before all electrochemical tests. Potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) experiments were carried out under a scan rate of 1 mV/s. The cathodic or anodic potentiodynamic scans (PS) were performed separately. The anodic and the cathodic branch of the polarization curve was terminated when the potential reached \u2212300 mV against the OCP. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed applying a sinusoidal perturbation of 10 mV amplitude and a frequency sweep from 10E^{\u22121}\u201310E^{5} Hz. Results of EIS experiments were analyzed with Zsimpwin software.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
shows the surface micro-morphology of PEO, PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5. a reveals that there are a large number of micropores with the size of 2\u20135 \u03bcm distributed on the PEO surface. The EDS mapping states that the PEO is constituted by Mg, Si, O and F. BaTiO3 micro-particles are inlaid on the outer part of PEO-BTO2 (b), and the amount of BaTiO3 micro-particles adhered on the surface of PEO-BTO5 (c) is larger than that of PEO-BTO2. a indicates that the thickness of the PEO coating is about 18 \xb1 2 \u03bcm. F distributes in the inner part near to the substrate. b and c reveals that BaTiO3 particles attach to not only on the surface of coatings but also in the interior of the coating. shows the micro-morphology of PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 surface with lower magnification. Apparently, BaTiO3 particles distribute in PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 uniformly. The relevant porosity of coatings was analyzed by ImageJ. manifests that the porosity of PEO-BTO2 (9.23 %) is slightly lower than PEO (9.57 %), while PEO-BTO5 maintains the lowest porosity (8.97 %). This is because parts of the doped BaTiO3 particles accumulates in micropores on PEO coatings\u2019 surface, which results in the sealing of micropores. The XRD result of PEO ( a) implies that the PEO coating is composed of MgO and Mg2SiO4. For PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5, the phases of BaTiO3 (JCPDS No. 74\u20132491) are also observed except for MgO (JCPDS No. 75\u20131585) and Mg2SiO4 (JCPDS No. 75\u20131450). The peak of Mg (JCPDS No. 89\u20135003) which is corresponding to the substrate can also be detected according to the porous structure of coatings. FTIR results (b) of PEO, PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 show Mg-O-Si (attributed to peaks of 420 cmE^{\u22121}, 448 cmE^{\u22121}, 533 cmE^{\u22121} and 622 cmE^{\u22121}) , Mg-O (corresponding to multi-peaks around 501 cmE^{\u22121} and 867 cmE^{\u22121}) , Si-O (corresponding to multi-peaks around 943 cmE^{\u22121} and 1082 cmE^{\u22121}) and Mg-F groups (attributed to peaks of 469 cmE^{\u22121} and 1003 cmE^{\u22121}). Which manifests that except for MgO and Mg2SiO4, SiO2 and MgF also present in the PEO coating. c manifests that the d33 value of pure Mg and PEO only reach and 1.0 pC/N, which indicates their poor ferroelectric property. To PEO-BTO2, its d33 value is 1.9 pC/N, replying that the doping of BaTiO3 enhances ferroelectric property of the PEO coating. The d33 value of PEO-BTO5 which is 2.5 pC/N reveals that the with the content of BaTiO3 in the PEO coating increases, its d33 value increases. According to d, the remanent polarization (Pr) of PEO is calculated to about 38.28 \u03bcc/cmE^{2}, which is at the same level as Pr of uncoated Mg. To PEO-BTO2, Pr increases to 49.65 \u03bcc/cmE^{2}. PEO-BTO5 maintains the highest Pr among all samples with the value of 57.22 \u03bcc/cmE^{2}. Since the higher Pr represents more significant ferroelectric property, the above results reveals that the PEO coating cannot endow pure Mg with the ferroelectric property. However, the doping of BaTiO3 has the positive effect on the ferroelectric properties for PEO coated samples. S3a reveals that the coating-substrate bonding strength of PEO, PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 remains similar value, distributes between 7.64 MPa and 7.82 MPa. Results in illustrates that the hardness of all kinds of coatings maintains the same level (549\u2013568 HV). These results proves that the doping of BaTiO3 does not influence the mechanical properties of the PEO coating. Previous results have proved that the ferroelectric property of PEO-coated pure Mg without BaTiO3 are not enhanced compared to that of uncoated pure Mg. Therefore, only PEO-coated pure Mg was selected for the antibacterial and antifouling tests. a shows the antibacterial effect of all coated samples to bacteria without any external stimulation. When co-cultured with PEO, the growth and reproduction of E.coli and S.aureus is inhibited. According to the calculation, the antibacterial rate of PEO to E.coli and S.aureus is 47.95 % and 37.11 % ( a\u2013b). To PEO-BTO2, the inhibition effect to the activity of the bacterial is more pronounced compared with that of PEO. The antibacterial of PEO-BTO2 is 66.55 % and 51.87 % to E.coli and S.aureus (a\u2013b). Among all coated samples, PEO-BTO5 manifests the best antibacterial rate of 70.61 % and 56.18 % (a\u2013b). When the UV irradiation is applied as the external stimulation, as shown in b, the antibacterial effect of PEO maintains the same level compared with PEO under no external stimulation. However, to PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5, the UV irradiation obviously strengthen the antibacterial effect of them to E.coli and S.aureus. The antibacterial rate of PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 to E.coli and S.aureus reaches to 99.99 % and 99.99 % under the UV irradiation (a\u2013b). Under the condition of co-culturing with PEO, the bacterial abilities are still excellent. When co culturing with PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5, the OD value of the bacterial suspension decreases slightly, resulting in weak activity. When the UV irradiation is exerted, the bacterial suspension co-cultured with PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 decreases sharply, representing the inhibition of growth and reproduction of bacterial. shows that a large number of E. coli and S. aureus are distributed on the surface of PEO, PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 without irradiation, and only little amount of bacteria are observed on the PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 surface with the UV irradiation. a and b shows the UV absorption spectrum of the Rhodamine B and Methyl Blue solution when immersed with PEO-BTO2 or PEO-BTO5 under the UV irradiation. The results demonstrates that as the duration of UV irradiation increased, the intensity of the absorption peak corresponding to Rhodamine B and Methyl Blue decreases, which represents their degradation. Under the same UV irradiation duration, PEO-BTO5 can better promote the degradation of two kinds of dye compared with that of PEO-BTO-2. To better indicate the degradation effect of PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5, the degradation rate of the dye solution is calculated and shown in c and d, accompanied with the discoloration behavior of the dye solution. The degradation rate PEO-BTO2 reaches to around 70 % when irradiated for 30 min, while PEO-BTO5 can achieve a higher degradation rate of around 80 %. From e, under the UV irradiation, the intensity at 426 nm elevates since terephthalic acid (TA) can react with \u2022OH produce by PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5, then transform into fluorescent 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid (HTA) which has relevant peak at 426 nm. As shown in f, when adding UV irradiation, the typical absorption peak of 1, 3-diphenyl isobenzofuran (DPBF) at 411 nm declines slightly due to its degradation caused by PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5. The results also indicate that the \u2022OH and \u2022O2 concentration generated by PEO-BTO5 is higher than that of PEO-BTO2. To investigate the difference in the antibacterial effect of the different coatings, the BaE^{2+} and MgE^{2+} release of the coated samples and the pH change of the bacterial suspension during the co-culture period are measured, and the results are shown in. PEO-BTO5 results in a higher BaE^{2+} release content compared with that of PEO-BTO2. The MgE^{2+} release content of all samples During immersion for 24 h decrease with the following order: PEO, PEO-BTO2, PEO-BTO5. The pH values of all the suspensions containing different samples increase, and the pH value of the PEO immersed suspension reaches 8.58. PEO-BTO2 keeps the suspension at a lower pH value compared with PEO to 8.46. The increase in pH value of the suspension containing PEO-BTO5 is smaller compared with PEO and PEO-BTO2. shows the H2 evolution tests of all samples during 15 d of immersion. Compared to coated Mg, the H2 evolution volume of uncoated Mg reaches a much higher value. To coated samples, at initial 7 d of immersion, the volume of H2 evolved from PEO, PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 maintains the same level. When immersed from 7 d to 15 d, the H2 evolution rate of PEO and PEO-BTO2 obviously increases. Simultaneously, the H2 evolution rate of PEO-BTO5 remains stable during the whole immersing period. The H2 evolution volume arrange in the order as follows: Pure Mg, PEO, PEO-BTO2, PEO-BTO5. The corrosion rate (PH) of the coated samples is calculated as follows: where V# is the slope of the curve of the volume of evolved hydrogen versus time. b shows that between 0 d and 7 d, PEO, PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 have similar PH value. After immersed for 7 d, PH of PEO increases to the highest value compared with that of all coated samples. In addition, PEO-BTO5 has the lower PH value than that of PEO-BTO2. During all immersion period, Mg remains the highest PH value. The corrosion potential (Ecorr), corrosion current density (icorr) and anodic/cathodic Tafel slopes (\u03b2a/-\u03b2c) are listed in , b \u2013 and. During the initial corrosion stages, The Ecorr value of PEO, PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 is similar, and the Ecorr value of PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 is slightly higher than that of PEO. The icorr value of PEO, PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 is also in the same order of magnitude, with PEO having the highest icorr value. While PEO-BTO2 has the slightly lower icorr than that of PEO-BTO5. After immersed for 15 d, the Ecorr value of all coated samples show a sharply decreasing trend, accompanied with the icorr value increase. Moreover, the icorr value of PEO increases with a higher speed faster than that of PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5. The icorr value of all samples increases by two orders of magnitude after corroded for 15 d. S4c, d and show the Nyquist and Bode plots of uncoated and coated samples. The corresponding suitable equivalent circuits for the EIS results in this research were selected under the lowest error rate of the fitting results, and were listed in and b\u2013d. During the fitting process, constant phase elements (CPE) are used instead of capacitances to account for the non-ideal behavior of the system. CPEo and Ro in the high frequency correspond to the outer layer on coatings of their capacitance and resistance behavior. CPEf and Rf represent the capacitance and resistance behavior of the corrosion product layer. CPEi and Ri in the middle frequency relate to the capacitance and resistance behavior of the inner layer on the coatings. CPEdl and Rct in the low frequency can be used to describe the double-layer capacitance on the electrolyte and the metal interface, and the charge transfer resistance of corrosion processes, while RL and L relate to the diffusion resistance of pitting corrosion. When immersed for 1 h, compared with uncoated Mg, all coated samples exhibit larger arc radius which represents great corrosion protection in the Nyquist diagrams. When reaches 15 d, the exhibited arc radius of all samples decreases. The high-frequency time constant which corresponding to the outer layer of the PEO disappears. During the whole immersion process, the impedance module of all coated samples arrange in the ascending order as follow: PEO-BTO5, PEO-BTO2, PEO. Simultaneously, the RL and L represents to the pitting behavior of Mg exists at initial stage. shows the morphology of corroded area on the surface of uncoated and coated samples which were immersed for 15 d. Corrosion pores with a depth of over 100 \u03bcm appear on the pure Mg surface where remain large amounts of corrosion products. The corrosion pores accumulated with large amount of corrosion products also exits on PEO surface, and the cross-sectional morphology reveals that the depth of the corrosion pore is about 50 \u03bcm. To PEO-BTO2, the depth of corrosion pores on its surface is about 30 \u03bcm, which is obviously smaller than that of PEO. The depth of corrosion pores on PEO-BTO5 surface is the lowest among three kinds of coatings (20 \u03bcm). Due to the accumulation and coverage of corrosion products, the corrosion pores on PEO-BTO5 are not directly in contact with the external environment. BaTiO3 particles are successfully doped into the PEO coating of Mg through a one-step method. The proportion of BaTiO3 in the PEO coating can be adjusted by controlling the concentration of BaTiO3 particles added to the PEO electrolyte. Since the BaTiO3 particles are doped during the growth process of the PEO coating, the BaTiO3 exists in the outer and inner part of the PEO coating. Through the analysis of the morphology and composition of PEO coatings doped with BaTiO3, it is clear that the doping of BaTiO3 will not affect the generation of the PEO coating. The BaTiO3 particles will not participate in the related chemical reactions of the PEO process. The reaction formula of the PEO process is as follows :  The PEO coated Mg has antibacterial property when it is under an environment containing bacteria. This is due to the degradation of the PEO coating and Mg which can cause an increase in the pH value of the surrounding environment. However, the antibacterial rate of the PEO coated Mg is relatively low. On the one hand, the pH value increase of the environment containing PEO coated Mg can only reaches to 8\u20138.2, which can hardly kill most of the bacterial. On the other hand, the MgE^{2+} ion eluted from the substrate through interconnected pores and cracks can promote the growth and reproduction of the bacterial. To PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5, the increase in environmental pH value caused by degradation is slightly lower than that of PEO. In the meanwhile, the environment with PEO-BTO5 maintains a lower pH value compared with the environment with PEO-BTO2. This is related to the influence of BaTiO3 doping on the corrosion resistance of PEO coatings. However, the content of BaTiO3 in the PEO coating is positively correlated with its antibacterial performance, which is related to the release of BaE^{2+} ion. Due to its cytotoxicity, BaE^{2+} ion can effectively reduce the activity of bacterial. However, due to the low concentration of BaE^{2+} ion released from PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5, the bacteria present in the environment can hardly be killed immediately , which is in consistent with the antibacterial experiments. BaTiO3 is a kind of environmentally friendly ceramic material with ABO3 type perovskite structure, which has excellent properties such as high dielectric constant (>1800) and low dielectric loss (<0.02). According to previous results in 3.2, the higher concentration of doped BaTiO3 can endow the PEO coating with more significant ferroelectric property, which also leads to the more pronounced piezoelectric properties of coatings. Under the stimulation of UV irradiation, the doped BaTiO3 in coatings can produce electron/hole pair, which could promote the formation of the reactive oxygen group (ROS) which are \u2022OH and \u2022O2. ROS can cause damage to the cell membrane structure of bacteria and inhibit their growth and proliferation. BaTiO3 with piezoelectric properties in coatings will polarize under the pressure of shaking. Subsequently, more ROS is generated. Therefore, under ultraviolet light, the antibacterial rate of PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 reaches 99.99 % within 24 h. The formula for the generation of ROS is as follows :  According to previous researches, the electron/hole pair and ROS generated by substances with ferroelectric/photocatalytic properties under pressure or light of different wavelengths are the two main photoactive substances for photocatalytic degradation of dyes. The degradation products of different dyes are small molecules such as H2O and CO2. The ROS, \u2022OH and \u2022O2, generated by the BaTiO3 doped in the PEO coating under UV light stimulation and stirring pressure can lead to the degradation of methyl blue and rhodamine B, accompanied by converting them into environmentally friendly substances. The degradation efficiency of the dye increases together with the increase of BaTiO3 content in the PEO coating which represent the higher concentration of formed ROS. As the duration of UV irradiation on PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 increases, the degradation rate of dyes will also be higher. When immersed for 1 h, the corrosion resistance of PEO, PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 is similar. This is because the doping of BaTiO3 does not affect the growth process of PEO coatings (, ). After immersed for 15 d, PEO-BTO5 keeps the best corrosion resistance of all samples, while the corrosion rate of PEO-BTO2 is higher than that of PEO. Since during the long-term corrosion process, the micropores in the PEO coating are preferentially corroded by the corrosive medium and lead to the failure of the PEO coating. Differently, the doping of BaTiO3 in the PEO coating partially seals the micropores on the surface of the coating, which isolate the coating from corrosive medium . This also explains that the higher doped content of BaTiO3 can provide better corrosion resistance to the coating. In this study, the 3.5 wt% NaCl solution was used to explore the difference of corrosion resistance of different coatings. The PEO coated Mg without BaTiO3 can serve as automotive components or 3C products shell in atmospheric environments for a long-time. The doping of BaTiO3 can further extend the service life of PEO coatings.

The substrate material used in this study is pure Mg (Mg > 99.95 wt%, Fe < 0.007 wt%, Al < 0.008 wt%, Mn < 0.005 wt%, provided by Suzhou JingJun New Materials Technology Co. Pure Mg was selected since our previous research experience can provide guidance for analyzing the growth process of PEO coatings. The sample size is 30 mm \xd7 15 mm \xd7 2 mm. The samples were mechanically ground with SiC paper up to 1000 grit, ultrasonically cleaned in ethyl alcohol, and then dried in the cold air before preparing PEO coatings. During the PEO process, Mg plates were used as the anode, and a stainless steel chamber was used as the cathode and reactor. The pulse reverse power provided a constant current of 2 A/dmE^{2} for 660 s under the frequency of 500 Hz and a duty cycle of 15 %. The electrolyte was prepared based on silicate salt (20 g/L Na2SiO3 + 4 g/L KF + 2 g/L NaOH). The BaTiO3 content in the PEO coating is controlled by the concentration of BaTiO3 powder (Macklin, China, 99.9 %, globular, 100\u2013200 nm) added to the electrolyte. The microstructural properties of applied BaTiO3 powder are shown in. PEO represents the PEO coating prepared without BaTiO3. PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 represents the PEO coating prepared in the electrolyte containing 2 g/L and 5 g/L BaTiO3 (Such concentration was selected by considering the doping amount of BaTiO3 in the PEO coating and the normal growth of the PEO coating). The solution was cooled down using a water-cooling system at 30 \xb1 5 \xb0C during the coating process. After PEO treatment the samples were rinsed in distilled water and dried in warm air. The microstructures and compositions of coatings were characterized with FEI Sirion 200 scanning electron microscope (SEM, Nova Nano SEM 450, FEI, America) equipped with an attached Oxford EDS detector (EDS, Oxford X-Max, FEI, America). The cross sections of the PEO-treated samples were cut, mounted in epoxy resin, and polished. X-ray diffractometer (PHILIPS, PW 1700, with a nickel-filtered Cu K\u03b1 radiation, and \u03bb = 0.154059 nm, Brucker, German) operating at 40 kV and 30 mA was used to analyze the different phases in the coatings. The chemical properties of coatings were characterized with attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR, Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS10, Thermo Scientific, America). The d33 value of all samples were measured with a Dielectric and Ferroelectric Testing System (ZJ-3, Jin Ke Zhi Chuang, China). Electric hysteresis loops of all samples under 1 Hz scanning from \u221220 V to 20 V with a scan rate of 0.1 V/s were measured using a ferroelectric tester (Precision LC II, Radiant Technology, Inc, USA.). The coating-substrate bonding strength was evaluated by an automatic pulling-off adhesion tester (BEVS 2201, provided by Guangzhou Shenghua Industrial Co., Ltd.). The pulling rate was 0.5 MPa sE^{\u22121}, and the contact area between was 49\u03c0 mmE^{2} (\u03a6 = 14 mm). The hardness of coatings was tested by the automatic microhardness measurement system (model: FM-700). The measurement interval is 0.2 mm, the applied load is 300 g, and the holding time is 20 s. The Luria-Bertani lysogeny broth (LB culture) was used for preparing bacterial suspension with the concentration of (1\u201310) \xd7 10E^{5} CFU/mL. The coated samples were sterilized and co-cultured with bacterial suspension for 24 h with and without the UV irradiation. After co-culturing 100 \u03bcL suspension was taken from each well to dilute by adding 900 \u03bcL LB culture, then 100 \u03bcL of suspension was spread onto the agar plates and incubated at 37 \xb0C for 24 h. All of the co-culturing suspension was collected and injected into a 96 well cell culture plate for measuring its OD value at 600 nm which represents the bacterial concentration on a microplate reader (MK3, Thermo, America). The co-culturing samples were cleaned and fixed in a 4 % glutaraldehyde solution. The sequential dehydration was achieved by immersing samples in ethanol solutions of different concentrations, which was finally dried prior to SEM observation. The coated samples were immersed in stirring 5 mg/L solutions of Rhodamine B or Methyl Blue. A UV (Ultraviolet) lamp with a power of 0.1 W/cmE^{2} was used to irradiate the dye solution containing coated sample for 3 h, 6 h and 9 h (9 h is the complete degradation time of dyes in some experimental groups), respectively. Afterwards, a UV spectrophotometer (F-7000, Hitachi, Japan) was used to detect the extracted dye solution for characterizing the antifouling performance of coatings. The degradation rate of dyes can be determined based on Lambert Beer's law : where A represents the absorption peak intensity at 554 nm and 664 nm (the main absorption band center of Rhodamine B and Methyl Blue). The degradation efficiency of the dye solution is defined as C/C0, where C0 and C represent the initial and actual concentrations of the dye after different durations of UV irradiation, respectively. Each sample was immersed into the LB culture for 24 h. The culture was removed and collected every 4 h during the last immersion period, followed by the addition of the fresh culture. An inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-OES, Thermo Scientific iCP 6500) was used to measure the concentrations of MgE^{2+} and BaE^{2+} respectively. Meanwhile, the pH value of the collected solution was measured in this study by a pH meter (PHS-3E, REX). The ROS generation ability of all samples was investigated. Terephthalic acid (TA) and 1, 3-diphenyl isobenzofuran (DPBF) were used as probing molecules for \u2022OH and \u2022O2. All samples were immersed in TA solution or DPBF solution under the ultraviolet irradiation. Afterwards, the spectral measurement (350\u2013600 nm) was subjected to using an excitation wavelength of 325 nm under a fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-7000, Hitachi, Japan). The Ultraviolet absorption spectrum (250\u2013600 nm) of the solution was measured by an ultraviolet spectrophotometer (Cary 5000, Agilent, Japan). The 3.5 wt% NaCl solution was used to distinguish the difference of corrosion resistance between different samples. The immersion tests were carried out by immersing coated samples in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution under a constant temperature (30 \xb1 1 \xb0C) maintaining solution volume to the surface area as 50 mL/cmE^{2}. The experiment was maintained for 15 d (Damage caused by corrosion appeared on all samples surfaces). The immersion solution was replaced per 24 h to stabilize its pH value at 7 \xb1 0.1. The evolved H2 was collected using inverted funnel and burette. Electrochemical tests were conducted in a 3.5 wt% NaCl solution at 30 \xb1 0.5 \xb0C by using an electrochemical workstation (PARSTAT 3000A-DX, Ametek, America). OCP was measured for 1 h until it was stable before all electrochemical tests. Potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) experiments were carried out under a scan rate of 1 mV/s. The cathodic or anodic potentiodynamic scans (PS) were performed separately. The anodic and the cathodic branch of the polarization curve was terminated when the potential reached \u2212300 mV against the OCP. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed applying a sinusoidal perturbation of 10 mV amplitude and a frequency sweep from 10E^{\u22121}\u201310E^{5} Hz. Results of EIS experiments were analyzed with Zsimpwin software.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
shows the surface micro-morphology of PEO, PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5. a reveals that there are a large number of micropores with the size of 2\u20135 \u03bcm distributed on the PEO surface. The EDS mapping states that the PEO is constituted by Mg, Si, O and F. BaTiO3 micro-particles are inlaid on the outer part of PEO-BTO2 (b), and the amount of BaTiO3 micro-particles adhered on the surface of PEO-BTO5 (c) is larger than that of PEO-BTO2. a indicates that the thickness of the PEO coating is about 18 \xb1 2 \u03bcm. F distributes in the inner part near to the substrate. b and c reveals that BaTiO3 particles attach to not only on the surface of coatings but also in the interior of the coating. shows the micro-morphology of PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 surface with lower magnification. Apparently, BaTiO3 particles distribute in PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 uniformly. The relevant porosity of coatings was analyzed by ImageJ. manifests that the porosity of PEO-BTO2 (9.23 %) is slightly lower than PEO (9.57 %), while PEO-BTO5 maintains the lowest porosity (8.97 %). This is because parts of the doped BaTiO3 particles accumulates in micropores on PEO coatings\u2019 surface, which results in the sealing of micropores. The XRD result of PEO ( a) implies that the PEO coating is composed of MgO and Mg2SiO4. For PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5, the phases of BaTiO3 (JCPDS No. 74\u20132491) are also observed except for MgO (JCPDS No. 75\u20131585) and Mg2SiO4 (JCPDS No. 75\u20131450). The peak of Mg (JCPDS No. 89\u20135003) which is corresponding to the substrate can also be detected according to the porous structure of coatings. FTIR results (b) of PEO, PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 show Mg-O-Si (attributed to peaks of 420 cmE^{\u22121}, 448 cmE^{\u22121}, 533 cmE^{\u22121} and 622 cmE^{\u22121}) , Mg-O (corresponding to multi-peaks around 501 cmE^{\u22121} and 867 cmE^{\u22121}) , Si-O (corresponding to multi-peaks around 943 cmE^{\u22121} and 1082 cmE^{\u22121}) and Mg-F groups (attributed to peaks of 469 cmE^{\u22121} and 1003 cmE^{\u22121}). Which manifests that except for MgO and Mg2SiO4, SiO2 and MgF also present in the PEO coating. c manifests that the d33 value of pure Mg and PEO only reach and 1.0 pC/N, which indicates their poor ferroelectric property. To PEO-BTO2, its d33 value is 1.9 pC/N, replying that the doping of BaTiO3 enhances ferroelectric property of the PEO coating. The d33 value of PEO-BTO5 which is 2.5 pC/N reveals that the with the content of BaTiO3 in the PEO coating increases, its d33 value increases. According to d, the remanent polarization (Pr) of PEO is calculated to about 38.28 \u03bcc/cmE^{2}, which is at the same level as Pr of uncoated Mg. To PEO-BTO2, Pr increases to 49.65 \u03bcc/cmE^{2}. PEO-BTO5 maintains the highest Pr among all samples with the value of 57.22 \u03bcc/cmE^{2}. Since the higher Pr represents more significant ferroelectric property, the above results reveals that the PEO coating cannot endow pure Mg with the ferroelectric property. However, the doping of BaTiO3 has the positive effect on the ferroelectric properties for PEO coated samples. S3a reveals that the coating-substrate bonding strength of PEO, PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 remains similar value, distributes between 7.64 MPa and 7.82 MPa. Results in illustrates that the hardness of all kinds of coatings maintains the same level (549\u2013568 HV). These results proves that the doping of BaTiO3 does not influence the mechanical properties of the PEO coating. Previous results have proved that the ferroelectric property of PEO-coated pure Mg without BaTiO3 are not enhanced compared to that of uncoated pure Mg. Therefore, only PEO-coated pure Mg was selected for the antibacterial and antifouling tests. a shows the antibacterial effect of all coated samples to bacteria without any external stimulation. When co-cultured with PEO, the growth and reproduction of E.coli and S.aureus is inhibited. According to the calculation, the antibacterial rate of PEO to E.coli and S.aureus is 47.95 % and 37.11 % ( a\u2013b). To PEO-BTO2, the inhibition effect to the activity of the bacterial is more pronounced compared with that of PEO. The antibacterial of PEO-BTO2 is 66.55 % and 51.87 % to E.coli and S.aureus (a\u2013b). Among all coated samples, PEO-BTO5 manifests the best antibacterial rate of 70.61 % and 56.18 % (a\u2013b). When the UV irradiation is applied as the external stimulation, as shown in b, the antibacterial effect of PEO maintains the same level compared with PEO under no external stimulation. However, to PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5, the UV irradiation obviously strengthen the antibacterial effect of them to E.coli and S.aureus. The antibacterial rate of PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 to E.coli and S.aureus reaches to 99.99 % and 99.99 % under the UV irradiation (a\u2013b). Under the condition of co-culturing with PEO, the bacterial abilities are still excellent. When co culturing with PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5, the OD value of the bacterial suspension decreases slightly, resulting in weak activity. When the UV irradiation is exerted, the bacterial suspension co-cultured with PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 decreases sharply, representing the inhibition of growth and reproduction of bacterial. shows that a large number of E. coli and S. aureus are distributed on the surface of PEO, PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 without irradiation, and only little amount of bacteria are observed on the PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 surface with the UV irradiation. a and b shows the UV absorption spectrum of the Rhodamine B and Methyl Blue solution when immersed with PEO-BTO2 or PEO-BTO5 under the UV irradiation. The results demonstrates that as the duration of UV irradiation increased, the intensity of the absorption peak corresponding to Rhodamine B and Methyl Blue decreases, which represents their degradation. Under the same UV irradiation duration, PEO-BTO5 can better promote the degradation of two kinds of dye compared with that of PEO-BTO-2. To better indicate the degradation effect of PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5, the degradation rate of the dye solution is calculated and shown in c and d, accompanied with the discoloration behavior of the dye solution. The degradation rate PEO-BTO2 reaches to around 70 % when irradiated for 30 min, while PEO-BTO5 can achieve a higher degradation rate of around 80 %. From e, under the UV irradiation, the intensity at 426 nm elevates since terephthalic acid (TA) can react with \u2022OH produce by PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5, then transform into fluorescent 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid (HTA) which has relevant peak at 426 nm. As shown in f, when adding UV irradiation, the typical absorption peak of 1, 3-diphenyl isobenzofuran (DPBF) at 411 nm declines slightly due to its degradation caused by PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5. The results also indicate that the \u2022OH and \u2022O2 concentration generated by PEO-BTO5 is higher than that of PEO-BTO2. To investigate the difference in the antibacterial effect of the different coatings, the BaE^{2+} and MgE^{2+} release of the coated samples and the pH change of the bacterial suspension during the co-culture period are measured, and the results are shown in. PEO-BTO5 results in a higher BaE^{2+} release content compared with that of PEO-BTO2. The MgE^{2+} release content of all samples During immersion for 24 h decrease with the following order: PEO, PEO-BTO2, PEO-BTO5. The pH values of all the suspensions containing different samples increase, and the pH value of the PEO immersed suspension reaches 8.58. PEO-BTO2 keeps the suspension at a lower pH value compared with PEO to 8.46. The increase in pH value of the suspension containing PEO-BTO5 is smaller compared with PEO and PEO-BTO2. shows the H2 evolution tests of all samples during 15 d of immersion. Compared to coated Mg, the H2 evolution volume of uncoated Mg reaches a much higher value. To coated samples, at initial 7 d of immersion, the volume of H2 evolved from PEO, PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 maintains the same level. When immersed from 7 d to 15 d, the H2 evolution rate of PEO and PEO-BTO2 obviously increases. Simultaneously, the H2 evolution rate of PEO-BTO5 remains stable during the whole immersing period. The H2 evolution volume arrange in the order as follows: Pure Mg, PEO, PEO-BTO2, PEO-BTO5. The corrosion rate (PH) of the coated samples is calculated as follows: where V# is the slope of the curve of the volume of evolved hydrogen versus time. b shows that between 0 d and 7 d, PEO, PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 have similar PH value. After immersed for 7 d, PH of PEO increases to the highest value compared with that of all coated samples. In addition, PEO-BTO5 has the lower PH value than that of PEO-BTO2. During all immersion period, Mg remains the highest PH value. The corrosion potential (Ecorr), corrosion current density (icorr) and anodic/cathodic Tafel slopes (\u03b2a/-\u03b2c) are listed in , b \u2013 and. During the initial corrosion stages, The Ecorr value of PEO, PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 is similar, and the Ecorr value of PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 is slightly higher than that of PEO. The icorr value of PEO, PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 is also in the same order of magnitude, with PEO having the highest icorr value. While PEO-BTO2 has the slightly lower icorr than that of PEO-BTO5. After immersed for 15 d, the Ecorr value of all coated samples show a sharply decreasing trend, accompanied with the icorr value increase. Moreover, the icorr value of PEO increases with a higher speed faster than that of PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5. The icorr value of all samples increases by two orders of magnitude after corroded for 15 d. S4c, d and show the Nyquist and Bode plots of uncoated and coated samples. The corresponding suitable equivalent circuits for the EIS results in this research were selected under the lowest error rate of the fitting results, and were listed in and b\u2013d. During the fitting process, constant phase elements (CPE) are used instead of capacitances to account for the non-ideal behavior of the system. CPEo and Ro in the high frequency correspond to the outer layer on coatings of their capacitance and resistance behavior. CPEf and Rf represent the capacitance and resistance behavior of the corrosion product layer. CPEi and Ri in the middle frequency relate to the capacitance and resistance behavior of the inner layer on the coatings. CPEdl and Rct in the low frequency can be used to describe the double-layer capacitance on the electrolyte and the metal interface, and the charge transfer resistance of corrosion processes, while RL and L relate to the diffusion resistance of pitting corrosion. When immersed for 1 h, compared with uncoated Mg, all coated samples exhibit larger arc radius which represents great corrosion protection in the Nyquist diagrams. When reaches 15 d, the exhibited arc radius of all samples decreases. The high-frequency time constant which corresponding to the outer layer of the PEO disappears. During the whole immersion process, the impedance module of all coated samples arrange in the ascending order as follow: PEO-BTO5, PEO-BTO2, PEO. Simultaneously, the RL and L represents to the pitting behavior of Mg exists at initial stage. shows the morphology of corroded area on the surface of uncoated and coated samples which were immersed for 15 d. Corrosion pores with a depth of over 100 \u03bcm appear on the pure Mg surface where remain large amounts of corrosion products. The corrosion pores accumulated with large amount of corrosion products also exits on PEO surface, and the cross-sectional morphology reveals that the depth of the corrosion pore is about 50 \u03bcm. To PEO-BTO2, the depth of corrosion pores on its surface is about 30 \u03bcm, which is obviously smaller than that of PEO. The depth of corrosion pores on PEO-BTO5 surface is the lowest among three kinds of coatings (20 \u03bcm). Due to the accumulation and coverage of corrosion products, the corrosion pores on PEO-BTO5 are not directly in contact with the external environment. BaTiO3 particles are successfully doped into the PEO coating of Mg through a one-step method. The proportion of BaTiO3 in the PEO coating can be adjusted by controlling the concentration of BaTiO3 particles added to the PEO electrolyte. Since the BaTiO3 particles are doped during the growth process of the PEO coating, the BaTiO3 exists in the outer and inner part of the PEO coating. Through the analysis of the morphology and composition of PEO coatings doped with BaTiO3, it is clear that the doping of BaTiO3 will not affect the generation of the PEO coating. The BaTiO3 particles will not participate in the related chemical reactions of the PEO process. The reaction formula of the PEO process is as follows :  The PEO coated Mg has antibacterial property when it is under an environment containing bacteria. This is due to the degradation of the PEO coating and Mg which can cause an increase in the pH value of the surrounding environment. However, the antibacterial rate of the PEO coated Mg is relatively low. On the one hand, the pH value increase of the environment containing PEO coated Mg can only reaches to 8\u20138.2, which can hardly kill most of the bacterial. On the other hand, the MgE^{2+} ion eluted from the substrate through interconnected pores and cracks can promote the growth and reproduction of the bacterial. To PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5, the increase in environmental pH value caused by degradation is slightly lower than that of PEO. In the meanwhile, the environment with PEO-BTO5 maintains a lower pH value compared with the environment with PEO-BTO2. This is related to the influence of BaTiO3 doping on the corrosion resistance of PEO coatings. However, the content of BaTiO3 in the PEO coating is positively correlated with its antibacterial performance, which is related to the release of BaE^{2+} ion. Due to its cytotoxicity, BaE^{2+} ion can effectively reduce the activity of bacterial. However, due to the low concentration of BaE^{2+} ion released from PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5, the bacteria present in the environment can hardly be killed immediately , which is in consistent with the antibacterial experiments. BaTiO3 is a kind of environmentally friendly ceramic material with ABO3 type perovskite structure, which has excellent properties such as high dielectric constant (>1800) and low dielectric loss (<0.02). According to previous results in 3.2, the higher concentration of doped BaTiO3 can endow the PEO coating with more significant ferroelectric property, which also leads to the more pronounced piezoelectric properties of coatings. Under the stimulation of UV irradiation, the doped BaTiO3 in coatings can produce electron/hole pair, which could promote the formation of the reactive oxygen group (ROS) which are \u2022OH and \u2022O2. ROS can cause damage to the cell membrane structure of bacteria and inhibit their growth and proliferation. BaTiO3 with piezoelectric properties in coatings will polarize under the pressure of shaking. Subsequently, more ROS is generated. Therefore, under ultraviolet light, the antibacterial rate of PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 reaches 99.99 % within 24 h. The formula for the generation of ROS is as follows :  According to previous researches, the electron/hole pair and ROS generated by substances with ferroelectric/photocatalytic properties under pressure or light of different wavelengths are the two main photoactive substances for photocatalytic degradation of dyes. The degradation products of different dyes are small molecules such as H2O and CO2. The ROS, \u2022OH and \u2022O2, generated by the BaTiO3 doped in the PEO coating under UV light stimulation and stirring pressure can lead to the degradation of methyl blue and rhodamine B, accompanied by converting them into environmentally friendly substances. The degradation efficiency of the dye increases together with the increase of BaTiO3 content in the PEO coating which represent the higher concentration of formed ROS. As the duration of UV irradiation on PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 increases, the degradation rate of dyes will also be higher. When immersed for 1 h, the corrosion resistance of PEO, PEO-BTO2 and PEO-BTO5 is similar. This is because the doping of BaTiO3 does not affect the growth process of PEO coatings (, ). After immersed for 15 d, PEO-BTO5 keeps the best corrosion resistance of all samples, while the corrosion rate of PEO-BTO2 is higher than that of PEO. Since during the long-term corrosion process, the micropores in the PEO coating are preferentially corroded by the corrosive medium and lead to the failure of the PEO coating. Differently, the doping of BaTiO3 in the PEO coating partially seals the micropores on the surface of the coating, which isolate the coating from corrosive medium . This also explains that the higher doped content of BaTiO3 can provide better corrosion resistance to the coating. In this study, the 3.5 wt% NaCl solution was used to explore the difference of corrosion resistance of different coatings. The PEO coated Mg without BaTiO3 can serve as automotive components or 3C products shell in atmospheric environments for a long-time. The doping of BaTiO3 can further extend the service life of PEO coatings.
