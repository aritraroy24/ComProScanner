KNN pellets of nominal stoichiometry K0.5Na0.5NbO3 were produced via the conventional solid-state synthesis route. Precursors of K2CO3 (99.995 %, Sigma-Aldrich\u2014Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), Na2CO3 (99.999 %, Sigma-Aldrich\u2014Merck), and Nb2O5 (99.9 %, Sigma-Aldrich\u2014Merck) were dried for a minimum of 12 hours in a 120 \xb0C drying oven prior to planetary ball milling (PM100, Retsch, Haan, Germany). Ball milling was conducted in 100 % ethanol with a 250 mL ZrO2 milling jar and 5 mm ZrO2 media for 3 h at 125 rpm. The resulting slurry was then dried using a rotary evaporator, ground with an agate mortar and pestle, and sieved with a 250 \u03bcm mesh stainless steel sieve. Three individual calcination pellets with a nominal weight of 3.0 g and a diameter of 25 mm were uniaxially pressed under 5 MPa in a stainless-steel die. Calcination took place in a muffle furnace (P330, Nabertherm, Lilienthal, Germany) at measured temperature of 801.5 \xb0C for 4 hours with a heating rate of 3 \xb0C/min and a cooling rate of approximately 4 \xb0C/min; temperature profile shown in Supplemental Figure. 1. Following calcination, pellets were milled in 100 % ethanol with a 250 mL ZrO2 milling jar and 5 mm ZrO2 media for 30 minutes at 125 rpm. The resulting slurry was again dried using a rotary evaporator, ground with an agate mortar and pestle, and sieved with a 150 \u03bcm mesh stainless steel sieve. Approximately 24 sintering pellets with a nominal weight of 0.30 g and a diameter of 10 mm were uniaxially pressed under 30 MPa in a stainless-steel die. Pellets were then isostatically pressed under 200 MPa with a dwell time of one minute. Pellets with sintered in batches of 3 in a partially closed alumina crucible in a triangular configuration (Supplemental Figure. 2) with sacrificial powder on both the bottom of the crucible and the surface of each pellet. Sintering took place in a muffle furnace at a measured temperature of 1103.5 \xb0C for 2 hours with a heating rate of 5 \xb0C/min and a cooling rate of approximately 4 \xb0C/min; temperature profile shown in Supplemental Figure. 3. Sintered pellets were prepared to a 1 \u03bcm surface finish (silicon carbide paper to 5 \u03bcm, polycrystalline diamond paste to 1 \u03bcm) prior to SEM/EDX analysis. Some pellets were thermally etched (1037.5 \xb0C for 7 minutes; heating rate 5 \xb0C/min) to increase grain boundary contrast; all thermally etched images are noted in caption. All SEM/EDX specimens were carbon coated (approximately 20 nm thickness) prior to imaging with SEM/EDX. Both calcined powder and sintered pellets were assessed with bulk XRD (D8 Advance, Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA). Sintered pellets were prepared to a 15 \u03bcm surface finish (silicon carbide paper) prior to analysis to remove the as-sintered surface. Indexed patterns of both specimen types (2-h scans with angular range 15\u201375 2\u03b8, receiving slit size 0.3 degrees, Cu K\u03b1 radiation) are shown below. Ferroelectric hysteresis measurements were performed with maximum applied fields of 40\u201395 kV/cm at a frequency of 1 Hz (n = 3). Converse measurements were conducted with a frequency of 100 Hz, major amplitude of 40 kV/cm, and minor amplitude of 4 kV/cm (n = 3). Laser diffraction particle size analysis (Partica LA-960V2, Horiba, Kyoto, Japan) was conducted on calcined powders after milling and sieving process (described above). 0.2 g of calcined powder was ultrasonically dispersed in 40 mL of 100 % ethanol prior to measurement. A total of 15 mg of KNN powder was combined with 500 mL of PBS solution and stirred using a magnetic stirrer for a duration of 2 h. The zeta potential of the suspension was assessed using electrophoretic mobility measurements of the suspended particles using the Zetasizer (Malvern Zetasizer Nano model series, Nano ZS; Malvern Panalytical Ltd, Malvern, UK). The sodium hyaluronate (HA) with a molecular weight of 47 kDa (Liuzhou Shengqiang Biotech Co., Ltd. in Guangxi, China) was subjected to modification using methacrylic anhydride (Me) with a molecular weight of 154.16 g/mol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Concisely, a tenfold excess of Me was slowly added drop by drop to 1 % w/v solution of HA in a potassium phosphate buffer at a temperature range of 0\u20134\xb0C. This was done under basic condition with a pH range of 8\u201310, which was adjusted using a 5 M solution of NaOH. The hydroxyl group of HA would undergo deprotonation, while the ester group of Me would be cleaved in this solution. The cleaved Me forms a chemical bond with the deprotonated hydroxyl group of HA, resulting in the generation of MeHA and methacrylic acid as a by-product. Following an extended period of reaction, the solution underwent purification using dialysis against ultrapure water for a minimum of 72 h at room temperature. The liquid portion was gathered, rapidly frozen and subjected to lyophilization for a period of 3\u20134 days, and subsequently kept at a temperature of \u221220\xb0C. Prior to performing the analysis using a 400 MHz E^{1}H NMR spectrometer (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany), the lyophilized polymers were dissolved in deuterium oxide (D2O, Sigma-Aldrich, Burlington, MA, USA). The D2O peak was calibrated to correspond to a value of 4.8 ppm. By comparing the integrals of the peaks of the protons on methacrylate alkene at 5.8 and 6.2 ppm to the integrals emanating from the protons of HA backbones, the degree of alteration was ascertained. In this investigation, the photo initiator lithium phenyl-2,4,6- trimethylbenzoylphosphinate (LAP) was used. The light source used has an initial light intensity of 1200 mW/cmE^{2} and a wavelength of 480 nm. KNN powder was added into a MeHA solution at a concentration of 2 % w/v. The Eppendorf containing a 500 \u03bcl combination of MeHA/LAP pre-gel solution was inverted after a certain duration of light curing, as stated above. If the gel remained suspended without dropping owing to gravity for at least 1 minute, it was recorded as completely gelled. The fabricated gel, which had a thickness of 1 mm and a diameter of 7 mm, was frozen at a temperature of \u221220\xb0C prior to undergoing lyophilization for a duration of 72 h. The samples underwent gold coating on their cross section for examination using a scanning electron microscope (SEM (IT-500HR), JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). The topography images were obtained using atomic force microscopy (AFM, Park NX-10) in non-contact mode. A non-contact probe (ACTA) with a spring constant of 37 N/m and a resonance frequency of 300 kHz was used. The samples were scanned at a velocity of 2 \u03bcm/s using an 8 nm set point. The gel disks were created by using a silicone mold, with a thickness of 1 mm and a diameter of 7 mm. Prior to immersion in the PBS solution, each sample was subjected to a process of weighting. After immersion in PBS at each time point at 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks and 1 month, the weight of each sample was re-measured, and the swelling ratio was determined using the formula described as follows: Swelling ratio = (\u03b2 I - \u03b1 I)/ \u03b1 I, where \u03b2 I refers to the weight of the samples before immersion in PBS at each time point and \u03b1 I is the weight of the samples before immersion in PBS. Prior to and after immersion in PBS, the diameter and thickness of each specimen were assessed using a digital caliper. Additionally, the volumes of the specimens were determined using the formula: V = \u03c0rE^{2}h, The change in volume of each specimen was determined by subtracting the initial volume before immersion in PBS from the final volume after immersion in PBS. In order to investigate the degradation profile of the specimens, a universal testing machine (EZ-S, Shimadzu, Japan) with a load capacity of 500 Newtons and a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min was used. The rheological characteristics of the hydrogels were analysed using the HAAKETM MARSTM rheometer (Thermo Scientific, Karlsruhe, Germany). The prefabricated samples, measuring 35 mm in diameter, were positioned between the titanium parallel plate and rotor, which likewise had a diameter of 35 mm. Subsequently, the samples were subjected to analysis using the oscillation amplitude sweep mode, with a strain range of 1\u20131000 % and a frequency of 1 Hz. Additionally, the frequency sweep mode was used at a frequency range of 0.1\u2013100 Hz, with a fixed strain of 1 %. Both experiments were performed at a body temperature of 37 E^{\u25e6}C and the experiment was duplicated. The mechanical characteristics of the tested scaffolds were reported, including the yield point value, which was determined by analyzing the connection between tan \u03b4 and the percentage of strain. The value of Tan \u03b4 was determined using the following equation: tan \u03b4 = G\u2032\u2032/G\u2032 The data were initially analysed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to assess the normality of the distribution. The threshold for statistical significance was set at a P value of.05.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
To the authors\u2019 knowledge, this study was the first to examine the synthesis and characterization\u2014gelation time, swelling and degradation, rheology, as well as micromorphological and topographical analyses\u2014of hybrid scaffolds made from MeHA and KNN in contrast to MeHA alone scaffolds. In this study, the SEM images showed that KNN exhibits cuboid grain structures ( A-D). The EDX findings showed a uniform distribution of elements, as shown in A. The phase of KNN was analyzed using XRD, which ascertained the presence of the typical pattern of secondary phases, as shown by small peaks detected at around 27\u201328\xb0C, which have been verified using the International Crystallographic Database (ICDD) with JCPDS card number 076\u20130977. illustrated the XRD pattern of K0.5Na0.5NbO3 powder that has undergone calcination at a temperature of 801.5 \xbaC for a duration of 4 h. This secondary phase is produced during solid-state sintering, which includes one or more calcinations at around 800 \xbaC, followed by sintering at roughly 1120 \xbaC. The issue stems from the limited sintering range of KNN, usually between 1100 and 1140\xb0C, which falls below the solidus temperature of 1150\xb0C. However, KNN possesses a piezoelectric coefficient (d 33 ) that exceed those seen in biological tissues. A previous study has shown that an electric field strength of 24 pC/N efficiently enhances the rate of bone defect repair in vivo. Additionally, an electric field strength ranging from 1 to 100 mV/cm was found to promote the osteogenesis. The KNN used in this study has a d 33 value of 94 \xb1 4 pC/N, as determined by the Berlincourt technique using a Sinocera YE2730A Berlincourt d 33 meter, and 69.3 \xb1 8.6 pC/N ascertained using the converse measurements. Thus, the KNN ceramics produced in this study possess a sufficient d 33 for potential biological applications. The volume distribution for the calcined powder is shown in and the average particle size was determined to be 0.65 \u03bcm. This heterogeneity of particle sizes may be attributed to the two-phase nature of the Nb2O5 precursor. Both orthorhombic and monoclinic Nb2O5 are present in the precursor powder and exhibit different milling behaviour. KNN that has been formed from orthorhombic Nb2O5 particles comprises the majority of the peak centred at 0.1 \u03bcm, whilst KNN from monoclinic Nb2O5 particles comprises the majority of the peak centred at 1 \u03bcm. This two-phase, bimodal precursor distribution also affects the reaction kinetics, causing orthorhombic-derived KNN to have excess sodium, and monoclinic-derived KNN to have excess potassium. These local stoichiometric heterogeneities further contribute to the formation of the aforementioned secondary phase K4Nb6O17. Zeta potential refers to the electric potential difference between the dispersion medium and the stationary layer of fluid that surrounds a dispersed particle; the term \u201crepulsion\u201d refers to the degree of aversion between adjacent particles with identical charges within a dispersion. In the present study, the KNN suspension exhibited a negative zeta potential of 19.6 mV at a pH of 7.4 for PBS, indicating some degree of stability. In this study, the low degree of modification ranging from 30 % to 40 % was employed to comprehend the fundamental characteristics of the tested parameters, especially those obtained from the hybrid scaffolds made of MeHA and KNN. The MeHA concentration was set at 4 % and the photoinitiator LAP was added to the gel solution in a 1:3 ratio for the photopolymerization process. The measured intensity was found to be one-third of the intensity provided by the manufacturer, which is 1200 mW/cmE^{2} and the same light source was used throughout the experiment. The total gel-forming time for MeHA alone scaffolds was 120 seconds; however, when combined with KNN, it was reduced to 80 seconds under the light intensity of 398 mW/cmE^{2}. The faster gelation time of hybrid scaffolds may be attributed to the high solubility of ions, resulting in a shorter duration for the rapid reaction to dissociate from KNN. In addition, the dissociated ions, such as sodium derived from KNN, may likely act as co-initiators, thereby reducing the gelation time. We also conducted a retrospective study to gain insights into the gelation time using the emitted light intensity (1100 mW/cmE^{2}), which closely matched the aforementioned manufacturer\u2019s specified intensity of 1200 mW/cmE^{2}. Upon retrospective confirmation, the intensity of 1100 mW/cmE^{2} was shown to be associated with the gelation time of 20 seconds for hybrid scaffolds, whereas the gelation time for MeHA alone scaffolds was 40 seconds. Hence, it is crucial to give priority to the assessment of the actual emitted light intensity rather than just relying on the initial intensity indicated by the manufacturer to fully comprehend the correlation between the emitted light intensity and gelation time, which affects the mechanical properties associated with the scaffolds\u2019 architecture, as well as to effectively interpret the obtained results. Having the correct pore size is an important parameter and if the pores were too minuscule, the cells would obstruct them, impeding cell penetration, the generation of ECM, and the formation of new blood vessels inside the scaffolds. It has been reported that the most suitable pore size for neovascularization is 5 \u03bcm , while the ideal pore size for fibroblast ingrowth ranges from 5 to 15 \u03bcm. For hepatocyte ingrowth, the optimal pore size is 20 \u03bcm. Adult mammalian skin regeneration requires pore sizes ranging from 20 to 125 \u03bcm , whereas osteoconduction necessitates pore sizes between 200 and 350 \u03bcm. The SEM micromorphological analysis of the present study showed an insignificant difference in pore sizes (P >.05). MeHA alone scaffolds had a mean pore size of 203.96 \u03bcm ( B), and hybrid scaffolds with KNN had a mean porous size of 156.9 \u03bcm ( D). Both MeHA alone and the hybrid scaffold samples had surfaces with tiny plateaus, but no significant holes or beads were found on the surfaces ( A and C). Light scatters across material interfaces , especially when hydrogel and KNN powder have different refractive indices. Light scattering increases with decreasing wavelength, and larger auxiliary particles, which are larger than 0.47 \u03bcm, cause light beams to scatter and deviate from their intended course. And thus, the particle size of the KNN powder and the wavelength of the light may potentially be the confounding factors in this study, indicating that the smaller particle size and longer wavelength be used. Another potential reason may be the disruption of dissociated ions from KNN to the crosslinking system. The pore structure of the investigated scaffold is only indicative of freeze-dried material, so SEM images do not accurately depict the functional microstructure of the hydrogel. In the present study, the roughness of the scaffolds\u2019 surfaces, as determined by the root mean square roughness (Rrms) values, was 52.67 nm for MeHA alone scaffolds and 10.8 nm for hybrid scaffolds that included KNN ( ). MeHA alone scaffolds also exhibited significant projections in comparison to the hybrid scaffolds. Although the exact mechanism generating a smoother surface in hybrid scaffolds is unclear, the dissociated cations from KNN may enhance the attractive force by binding to the negative end of water molecules in the hydrogel. Hydrogels with suitable mechanical properties have the potential to not only provide stabilization to the networking system when positioned between two separate hard-tissue structures but also to emulate characteristics of the natural ECM that influence cellular activities. Nevertheless, prior investigations have established that hydrogels based on HA undergo rapid biodegradation in vivo and lack appropriate mechanical stability, which is primarily attributed to the elevated hydrophilicity and subsequent swelling capacity of HA. And thus, HA-based hydrogel scaffolds should exhibit not only elevated regenerative potential and biocompatibility but also mechanical characteristics that are comparable to those of native physiological tissues. Significant differences were observed between the MeHA alone groups at 1 day and 1 week (.A), however the hybrid group at 2 weeks had a significantly lower value compared to the other hybrid groups (P <.05). The corresponding time intervals of the two scaffold types at 1 week and 2 weeks showed significant differences. The hybrid scaffolds exhibited a substantial greater swelling ratio at 1 week, whereas the HA alone scaffolds had a significantly higher swelling ratio at 2 weeks (P <.05), indicating the lower density of crosslinking. The pore size, which correspond to the mesh size between crosslinks, may contribute to the swelling ratio to some extent in this investigation; this phenomenon might be a result of the hydrogel\u2019s heightened capacity to absorb a greater amount of water. A substantial difference in volume change was only seen between MeHA groups at 1 week and 1 month (P <.05) (.B). The median and interquartile range (IQR) of the compressive strength for each of the experimental groups were shown in. The set of scaffolds, consisting of both types, had a significantly reduced compressive strength after 1 month immersed in PBS (P <.05). A substantial difference was observed between two types of scaffolds after 1 day (P <.05). The same pattern of reduced elastic modulus was also seen after a period of one month with significant difference (P <.05) ( ). There was no notable disparity in the elastic modulus between the two distinct types of scaffolds at the time points that were examined (P >.05). The results showed that compared to the 1-month group, the other groups had higher compressive strength and elastic modulus, with or without significant differences. This indicated that they were capable of withstanding deformation within a specific range of elastic strength or loads, therefore demonstrating the deterioration characteristics of the 1-month group. This may be because the addition of KNN could compensate for a certain degree of strength. In this study, amplitude sweep experiment was conducted to identify the linear viscoelastic region (LVR) or Newtonian behavior of the investigated scaffolds. The low shear stress conditions caused the hybrid scaffolds to develop LVR. The process demonstrated the dependence of the scaffolds\u2019 moduli on the increasing stress. The mean and standard error of the total storage modulus (G\u2032) and yield point (tan \u03b4) of the tested scaffolds were presented in A and C. The mean value of the total storage modulus (G\u2032) of MeHA alone scaffolds was 738.94 Pa, whereas the hybrid scaffolds had a much lower total mean value of 177.88 Pa. The inclusion of KNN impacted the yield points, which may be due to the solid content of KNN in the hybrid scaffolds and/or the disruption caused by KNN to the crosslinking system. To ascertain the correlation between the frequency of testing and the storage (G\u2032) and loss (G\u2032\u2032) moduli of a material, a frequency sweep was conducted. Additionally, it provides valuable information on the viscoelastic characteristics and condition of a material by comparing the values of G\u2032 and G\u2032\u2032 across different frequencies. The G\u2032 and G\u2032\u2032 values of the examined scaffolds exhibited a high degree of frequency independence, with the loss modulus being consistently larger than the storage modulus over the almost entire range of frequencies (Fig. 11 C and D). Both types of scaffolds had G\u2032 and G\u2032\u2032 values that were independent of the frequency; however, MeHA alone scaffolds showed a crossover point, indicating reversible crosslinking. The mean and standard error of the total storage modulus (G\u2032) and yield point (tan \u03b4) of the frequency sweep of the tested scaffolds were presented in B and D. MeHA alone scaffolds had an average total storage modulus (G\u2032) of 46181.94 Pa, whereas the hybrid scaffolds had a much higher average total value of 142381.9 Pa. The incorporation of KNN into MeHA hydrogel shows promise for biological application, although it causes the partial pore formation and affects the yield point of the rheological properties, which paves the way for further investigations, such as biocompatibility, cell proliferation and differentiation, using different degrees of modifications and cross-linking agents, as well as various KNN particle sizes, wavelengths, and compositions.

Additionally, the volumes of the specimens were determined using the formula: V = \u03c0rE^{2}h, The change in volume of each specimen was determined by subtracting the initial volume before immersion in PBS from the final volume after immersion in PBS. In order to investigate the degradation profile of the specimens, a universal testing machine (EZ-S, Shimadzu, Japan) with a load capacity of 500 Newtons and a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min was used. The rheological characteristics of the hydrogels were analysed using the HAAKETM MARSTM rheometer (Thermo Scientific, Karlsruhe, Germany). The prefabricated samples, measuring 35 mm in diameter, were positioned between the titanium parallel plate and rotor, which likewise had a diameter of 35 mm. Subsequently, the samples were subjected to analysis using the oscillation amplitude sweep mode, with a strain range of 1\u20131000 % and a frequency of 1 Hz. Additionally, the frequency sweep mode was used at a frequency range of 0.1\u2013100 Hz, with a fixed strain of 1 %. Both experiments were performed at a body temperature of 37 E^{\u25e6}C and the experiment was duplicated. The mechanical characteristics of the tested scaffolds were reported, including the yield point value, which was determined by analyzing the connection between tan \u03b4 and the percentage of strain. The value of Tan \u03b4 was determined using the following equation: tan \u03b4 = G\u2032\u2032/G\u2032 The data were initially analysed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to assess the normality of the distribution. The threshold for statistical significance was set at a P value of.05.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
To the authors\u2019 knowledge, this study was the first to examine the synthesis and characterization\u2014gelation time, swelling and degradation, rheology, as well as micromorphological and topographical analyses\u2014of hybrid scaffolds made from MeHA and KNN in contrast to MeHA alone scaffolds. In this study, the SEM images showed that KNN exhibits cuboid grain structures ( A-D). The EDX findings showed a uniform distribution of elements, as shown in A. The phase of KNN was analyzed using XRD, which ascertained the presence of the typical pattern of secondary phases, as shown by small peaks detected at around 27\u201328\xb0C, which have been verified using the International Crystallographic Database (ICDD) with JCPDS card number 076\u20130977. illustrated the XRD pattern of K0.5Na0.5NbO3 powder that has undergone calcination at a temperature of 801.5 \xbaC for a duration of 4 h. This secondary phase is produced during solid-state sintering, which includes one or more calcinations at around 800 \xbaC, followed by sintering at roughly 1120 \xbaC. The issue stems from the limited sintering range of KNN, usually between 1100 and 1140\xb0C, which falls below the solidus temperature of 1150\xb0C. However, KNN possesses a piezoelectric coefficient (d 33 ) that exceed those seen in biological tissues. A previous study has shown that an electric field strength of 24 pC/N efficiently enhances the rate of bone defect repair in vivo. Additionally, an electric field strength ranging from 1 to 100 mV/cm was found to promote the osteogenesis. The KNN used in this study has a d 33 value of 94 \xb1 4 pC/N, as determined by the Berlincourt technique using a Sinocera YE2730A Berlincourt d 33 meter, and 69.3 \xb1 8.6 pC/N ascertained using the converse measurements. Thus, the KNN ceramics produced in this study possess a sufficient d 33 for potential biological applications. The volume distribution for the calcined powder is shown in and the average particle size was determined to be 0.65 \u03bcm. This heterogeneity of particle sizes may be attributed to the two-phase nature of the Nb2O5 precursor. Both orthorhombic and monoclinic Nb2O5 are present in the precursor powder and exhibit different milling behaviour. KNN that has been formed from orthorhombic Nb2O5 particles comprises the majority of the peak centred at 0.1 \u03bcm, whilst KNN from monoclinic Nb2O5 particles comprises the majority of the peak centred at 1 \u03bcm. This two-phase, bimodal precursor distribution also affects the reaction kinetics, causing orthorhombic-derived KNN to have excess sodium, and monoclinic-derived KNN to have excess potassium. These local stoichiometric heterogeneities further contribute to the formation of the aforementioned secondary phase K4Nb6O17. Zeta potential refers to the electric potential difference between the dispersion medium and the stationary layer of fluid that surrounds a dispersed particle; the term \u201crepulsion\u201d refers to the degree of aversion between adjacent particles with identical charges within a dispersion. In the present study, the KNN suspension exhibited a negative zeta potential of 19.6 mV at a pH of 7.4 for PBS, indicating some degree of stability. In this study, the low degree of modification ranging from 30 % to 40 % was employed to comprehend the fundamental characteristics of the tested parameters, especially those obtained from the hybrid scaffolds made of MeHA and KNN. The MeHA concentration was set at 4 % and the photoinitiator LAP was added to the gel solution in a 1:3 ratio for the photopolymerization process. The measured intensity was found to be one-third of the intensity provided by the manufacturer, which is 1200 mW/cmE^{2} and the same light source was used throughout the experiment. The total gel-forming time for MeHA alone scaffolds was 120 seconds; however, when combined with KNN, it was reduced to 80 seconds under the light intensity of 398 mW/cmE^{2}. The faster gelation time of hybrid scaffolds may be attributed to the high solubility of ions, resulting in a shorter duration for the rapid reaction to dissociate from KNN. In addition, the dissociated ions, such as sodium derived from KNN, may likely act as co-initiators, thereby reducing the gelation time. We also conducted a retrospective study to gain insights into the gelation time using the emitted light intensity (1100 mW/cmE^{2}), which closely matched the aforementioned manufacturer\u2019s specified intensity of 1200 mW/cmE^{2}. Upon retrospective confirmation, the intensity of 1100 mW/cmE^{2} was shown to be associated with the gelation time of 20 seconds for hybrid scaffolds, whereas the gelation time for MeHA alone scaffolds was 40 seconds. Hence, it is crucial to give priority to the assessment of the actual emitted light intensity rather than just relying on the initial intensity indicated by the manufacturer to fully comprehend the correlation between the emitted light intensity and gelation time, which affects the mechanical properties associated with the scaffolds\u2019 architecture, as well as to effectively interpret the obtained results. Having the correct pore size is an important parameter and if the pores were too minuscule, the cells would obstruct them, impeding cell penetration, the generation of ECM, and the formation of new blood vessels inside the scaffolds. It has been reported that the most suitable pore size for neovascularization is 5 \u03bcm , while the ideal pore size for fibroblast ingrowth ranges from 5 to 15 \u03bcm. For hepatocyte ingrowth, the optimal pore size is 20 \u03bcm. Adult mammalian skin regeneration requires pore sizes ranging from 20 to 125 \u03bcm , whereas osteoconduction necessitates pore sizes between 200 and 350 \u03bcm. The SEM micromorphological analysis of the present study showed an insignificant difference in pore sizes (P >.05). MeHA alone scaffolds had a mean pore size of 203.96 \u03bcm ( B), and hybrid scaffolds with KNN had a mean porous size of 156.9 \u03bcm ( D). Both MeHA alone and the hybrid scaffold samples had surfaces with tiny plateaus, but no significant holes or beads were found on the surfaces ( A and C). Light scatters across material interfaces , especially when hydrogel and KNN powder have different refractive indices. Light scattering increases with decreasing wavelength, and larger auxiliary particles, which are larger than 0.47 \u03bcm, cause light beams to scatter and deviate from their intended course. And thus, the particle size of the KNN powder and the wavelength of the light may potentially be the confounding factors in this study, indicating that the smaller particle size and longer wavelength be used. Another potential reason may be the disruption of dissociated ions from KNN to the crosslinking system. The pore structure of the investigated scaffold is only indicative of freeze-dried material, so SEM images do not accurately depict the functional microstructure of the hydrogel. In the present study, the roughness of the scaffolds\u2019 surfaces, as determined by the root mean square roughness (Rrms) values, was 52.67 nm for MeHA alone scaffolds and 10.8 nm for hybrid scaffolds that included KNN ( ). MeHA alone scaffolds also exhibited significant projections in comparison to the hybrid scaffolds. Although the exact mechanism generating a smoother surface in hybrid scaffolds is unclear, the dissociated cations from KNN may enhance the attractive force by binding to the negative end of water molecules in the hydrogel. Hydrogels with suitable mechanical properties have the potential to not only provide stabilization to the networking system when positioned between two separate hard-tissue structures but also to emulate characteristics of the natural ECM that influence cellular activities. Nevertheless, prior investigations have established that hydrogels based on HA undergo rapid biodegradation in vivo and lack appropriate mechanical stability, which is primarily attributed to the elevated hydrophilicity and subsequent swelling capacity of HA. And thus, HA-based hydrogel scaffolds should exhibit not only elevated regenerative potential and biocompatibility but also mechanical characteristics that are comparable to those of native physiological tissues. Significant differences were observed between the MeHA alone groups at 1 day and 1 week (.A), however the hybrid group at 2 weeks had a significantly lower value compared to the other hybrid groups (P <.05). The corresponding time intervals of the two scaffold types at 1 week and 2 weeks showed significant differences. The hybrid scaffolds exhibited a substantial greater swelling ratio at 1 week, whereas the HA alone scaffolds had a significantly higher swelling ratio at 2 weeks (P <.05), indicating the lower density of crosslinking. The pore size, which correspond to the mesh size between crosslinks, may contribute to the swelling ratio to some extent in this investigation; this phenomenon might be a result of the hydrogel\u2019s heightened capacity to absorb a greater amount of water. A substantial difference in volume change was only seen between MeHA groups at 1 week and 1 month (P <.05) (.B). The median and interquartile range (IQR) of the compressive strength for each of the experimental groups were shown in. The set of scaffolds, consisting of both types, had a significantly reduced compressive strength after 1 month immersed in PBS (P <.05). A substantial difference was observed between two types of scaffolds after 1 day (P <.05). The same pattern of reduced elastic modulus was also seen after a period of one month with significant difference (P <.05) ( ). There was no notable disparity in the elastic modulus between the two distinct types of scaffolds at the time points that were examined (P >.05). The results showed that compared to the 1-month group, the other groups had higher compressive strength and elastic modulus, with or without significant differences. This indicated that they were capable of withstanding deformation within a specific range of elastic strength or loads, therefore demonstrating the deterioration characteristics of the 1-month group. This may be because the addition of KNN could compensate for a certain degree of strength. In this study, amplitude sweep experiment was conducted to identify the linear viscoelastic region (LVR) or Newtonian behavior of the investigated scaffolds. The low shear stress conditions caused the hybrid scaffolds to develop LVR. The process demonstrated the dependence of the scaffolds\u2019 moduli on the increasing stress. The mean and standard error of the total storage modulus (G\u2032) and yield point (tan \u03b4) of the tested scaffolds were presented in A and C. The mean value of the total storage modulus (G\u2032) of MeHA alone scaffolds was 738.94 Pa, whereas the hybrid scaffolds had a much lower total mean value of 177.88 Pa. The inclusion of KNN impacted the yield points, which may be due to the solid content of KNN in the hybrid scaffolds and/or the disruption caused by KNN to the crosslinking system. To ascertain the correlation between the frequency of testing and the storage (G\u2032) and loss (G\u2032\u2032) moduli of a material, a frequency sweep was conducted. Additionally, it provides valuable information on the viscoelastic characteristics and condition of a material by comparing the values of G\u2032 and G\u2032\u2032 across different frequencies. The G\u2032 and G\u2032\u2032 values of the examined scaffolds exhibited a high degree of frequency independence, with the loss modulus being consistently larger than the storage modulus over the almost entire range of frequencies (Fig. 11 C and D). Both types of scaffolds had G\u2032 and G\u2032\u2032 values that were independent of the frequency; however, MeHA alone scaffolds showed a crossover point, indicating reversible crosslinking. The mean and standard error of the total storage modulus (G\u2032) and yield point (tan \u03b4) of the frequency sweep of the tested scaffolds were presented in B and D. MeHA alone scaffolds had an average total storage modulus (G\u2032) of 46181.94 Pa, whereas the hybrid scaffolds had a much higher average total value of 142381.9 Pa. The incorporation of KNN into MeHA hydrogel shows promise for biological application, although it causes the partial pore formation and affects the yield point of the rheological properties, which paves the way for further investigations, such as biocompatibility, cell proliferation and differentiation, using different degrees of modifications and cross-linking agents, as well as various KNN particle sizes, wavelengths, and compositions.
