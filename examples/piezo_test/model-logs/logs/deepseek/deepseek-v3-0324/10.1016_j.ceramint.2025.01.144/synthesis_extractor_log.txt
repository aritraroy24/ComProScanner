Thin-film samples of 3 mol% Mn-doped 0.8(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3\u20130.2(Bi0.5K0.5)TiO3 (abbreviated as BNKT-20-3M) were prepared using the sol-gel method. The precursors for the sol-gel synthesis were bismuth(III) nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3\xb75H2O, 99.5%, J.T. Baker), sodium acetate (Na(CH3COO), 99.5%, J.T. Baker), potassium acetate (K(CH3COO), 99%, Sigma-Aldrich), titanium(IV) butoxide (Ti(OC4H9)4, 99+%, Alfa Aesar), and manganese(II) acetate (Mn(CH3COO)2, 98+%, Alfa Aesar), mixing in their respective stoichiometric ratios. Propan-2-ol (CH3CHOHCH3, 99.8+%, Fisher Chemical) and acetic acid (CH3COOH, 99.8%, Honeywell) were used as solvents, while pentane-2,4-dione (CH3C(O)CH2C(O)CH3, 99%, Alfa Aesar) served as the polymerizing agent. The mixture was stirred at room temperature at 700 rpm, with formamide (HCONH2, 99.5%, J.T. The final 0.3 M solution was allowed to polymerize for seven days before deposition. Each thin-film sample consisted of 6 layers of BNKT-20-3M and was deposited on commercial Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrate via spin-coating. Each layer of BNKT-20-3M was deposited by spinning at 500 rpm for 10 s and then at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Following the spin-coating, a series of heat treatments was applied, including evaporation at 200 \xb0C, pyrolysis at 500 \xb0C, and annealing at 750 \xb0C, each for 5 min. The above-described sequence was repeated 6 times, resulting in a thin-film sample approximately 220 nm thick. For comparison purposes, some thin-film samples were further heat-treated in a nitrogen (N2) atmosphere at 1 atm, 750 \xb0C for 30 min after the cooling procedure for defect passivation. Finally, circular Pt top electrodes with an area of 0.283 mmE^{2} were deposited on the thin-film sample by RF magnetron sputtering (CESAR 133, Dressler) in argon plasma, creating a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) structure for electrical characterizations using a ferroelectric analyzer (TF 2000E, aixACCT). The crystalline phases of the BNKT-20-3M thin films prepared under various conditions were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD; TTRAX III, Rigaku) using Cu K\u03b1 radiation in grazing-incidence (GIXRD) mode. The surface morphology of the films was examined by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; Nova NanoSEM 450, FEI). High-resolution structural data of the films, including high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) images, were obtained using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM; Spectra 300 FEG-S/TEM, Thermo Fisher) equipped with an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) detector (Super-X G2) for elemental mapping. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) diffractograms of the HAADF images were processed using DigitalMicrograph software (Gatan, USA). Specimens for the STEM analysis were prepared using a focused ion beam system (FIB; Helios NanoLab 600i, FEI). Cation displacements in the BNKT-20-3M lattice were extracted from the HAADF image using the TEMUL Toolkit. The desired region was cropped from the HAADF image and underwent band-pass FFT filtering. Atom positions were determined by fitting 2D Gaussian peaks, allowing for the identification and mapping of cation displacements on the FFT-filtered image.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The schematic of the MIM structure of the BNKT-20-3M thin-film samples prepared for this study is shown in a. The SEM micrographs of the surfaces of the air-cooled (AC) and liquid nitrogen quenched (LNQ) thin-film samples are shown in b and c, respectively. In the BNKT-20-3M thin-film samples, the uniform and dense grain structure was established during the sol-gel deposition, drying, pyrolysis, and fast annealing (5 min), leaving little room for further morphological changes during cooling/quenching. The Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrate also acted as a thermal sink, reducing the thermal shock experienced by the film. The crystal structures of the thin-film samples were revealed by the XRD analysis, as shown in a. The black and red lines represent the XRD patterns of the AC and LNQ samples, respectively. For comparison, diffraction patterns from the ICSD database for the cubic/pseudo-cubic (C) Pm 3\u203em and rhombohedral (R) R3c space groups of BNT and the tetragonal (T) P4mm space group of BKT are also provided. The fine scans across 2\u03b8 positions of major diffraction peaks, as shown in b\u2212e, indicate that the overall structure of BNKT-20-3M is heavily influenced by the C- and R-phases of BNT, which is expected due to the larger portion of BNT in the solid solution. Furthermore, the minimal difference between the patterns of the AC and LNQ samples suggests that different cooling treatments did not significantly alter the average crystallinity of the BNKT-20-3M thin films. Rietveld refinements were performed on the XRD data using GSAS-II software to estimate the phase proportions and lattice constants of the AC and LNQ samples. The refinements indicate that the AC and LNQ samples contained more than 56% of the C-phase and exhibited similar c/a ratios for the T- and R-phases. Despite this, the LNQ sample had a larger combined proportion of T- and R-phases than the AC sample, indicating a higher degree of lattice asymmetry. It is important to emphasize that XRD provides an \u201caverage\u201d perspective of the crystallographic features, and factors such as microstrain or defects can influence the 2\u03b8 peak positions beyond just the lattice constants. Given the predominantly pseudo-cubic nature of the BNKT-20-3M thin films, structural differences between the two cooling methods (AC vs. LNQ), particularly those occurring at the nanometer scale (e.g., order/disorder arrangement of cations), may not be readily discernible in the XRD measurements. The P-E hysteresis curves of the BNKT-20-3M thin films treated with AC and LNQ are shown in a. It is evident that a faster cooling treatment has induced substantially larger polarization values, with P r increased from 6.9 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} under AC to 12.3 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} under LNQ, and P max increased from 40.6 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} under AC to 56.0 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} under LNQ at 680 kV/cm. The evolutions of Wrec and \u03b7 of the thin films with increasing applied electric field are shown in b. By changing the cooling method from AC to LNQ, Wrec at maximum electric field (680 kV/cm) increased by nearly 23%, from 8.2 to 10.1 J/cmE^{3}; however, the corresponding \u03b7 dropped from 68.0 to 57.4% due to increased P r with a faster cooling treatment. The steps to calculate Wrec and \u03b7 from the P-E hysteresis are readily available in the literature. Since the average crystallinities of the BNKT-20-3M thin films treated with AC and LNQ show little difference based on the XRD results, STEM was applied to examine their nanoscale structural features to shed light on the apparent difference in polarization hysteresis. The bright field image of the BNKT-20-3M thin film (shown in a) indicates that the film prepared by the sol-gel method had a thickness of \u223c220 nm. The HAADF images of electrically poled AC and LNQ samples are shown in b and c, respectively. Contrast fluctuation stemming from the arrangement of different ions is evident in these images. d is the zoom-in HAADF image of the AC sample with an EDS line scan to track the intensities and positions of the Bi and Ti cations. The correlation between the intensity of atom columns in the HAADF image and the intensities of Bi and Ti signals is shown in e. It is evident that the positions of the higher HAADF intensity peaks (i.e., brighter points on the image) correspond to the positions of the heavier A-site Bi cations, while the lower HAADF intensity peaks (i.e., darker points on the image) correspond to the positions of the lighter B-site Ti cations. Once the positions of Bi and Ti were identified, a Python-based package, TEMUL Toolkit , was utilized to extract information on polarizations from the HAADF images. Although the oxygen anions are unable to be observed in the images, the displacement of the B-site Ti cation relative to the geometrical center of the A-site cations, as shown in f, could be used to indicate the electrical dipole present in the perovskite unit cell based on the Born effective charge calculation. a and b show the FFT diffractograms of the AC and LNQ samples, respectively, derived from their HAADF images. The FFT diffractogram indicates that the BNKT-20-3M thin film prepared with AC was predominantly a pseudo-cubic structure. In contrast, the FFT diffractogram of the film prepared with LNQ shows the splitting of high-index spots, indicating the presence of R3c rhombohedral distortion within the pseudo-cubic matrix. Based on the XRD results, Rietveld refinements, and FFT diffractograms, it is evident that the BNKT-20-3M thin film, regardless of the cooling method, contained low symmetry nanoscale domains, which, when overlapped, showed a cubic average symmetry. c and d show the mapping of dipole moments (based on the displacements of B-site Ti cations) on the HAADF images of the BNKT-20-3M thin films prepared with the AC and LNQ methods, respectively. Comparing the size and distribution of colored areas (i.e., could be viewed as ferroelectric domains) in the two maps, it is evident that the AC sample exhibited few but larger domains with a coherence length in the range of 5\u201310 nm, while the LNQ sample showed a distribution of numerous smaller domains (< 5 nm) with non-180\xb0 domain walls. Although the coherence length of the LNQ sample is slightly shorter, the onset of polarization switching for non-180\xb0 domains is typically lower than that of 180\xb0 domains. The non-180\xb0 arrangement of nanoscale domains in the LNQ sample would facilitate the polarization reversal during electric field cycling, especially at small electric fields. A higher degree of lattice distortion in a predominantly pseudo-cubic structure is expected to produce a larger net polarization. e and f show the mapping of c/a ratios on the HAADF images of the BNKT-20-3M thin films prepared with the AC and LNQ methods, respectively. The comparison of c/a ratios in the two maps shows that the LNQ lattice exhibits a slightly higher range (up to 1.25) than the AC lattice (up to 1.14), though their overall ranges largely overlap. When combined with the Rietveld refinement results, the slightly greater lattice asymmetry in the LNQ sample is expected to increase lattice strain, thereby lowering the energy barrier for polarization switching, consistent with Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory calculations. Based on the mapping of domains and c/a ratios of the lattice of the BNKT-20-3M thin films, it is evident that a rapid quenching procedure in liquid nitrogen can induce a large number of PNRs with a high degree of distortion, leading to a non-180\xb0 domain arrangement with soft ferroelectric switching. This was achieved by performing an additional N2 passivation annealing treatment on the thin film at 750 \xb0C for 30 min. Regarding lattice defects, oxygen vacancies (VO) are commonly observed in perovskite oxide thin films. For the BNKT-20-3M sol-gel thin films developed in this study, oxygen vacancies were primarily generated due to the volatilization of cations during pyrolysis and annealing at elevated temperatures, as described in the reactions provided from Equations ). During these processes, oxygen from the surrounding atmosphere reacted with VO in the thin film, leading to the formation of a large number of holes (h\u2219), as depicted in Equation. Although Mn dopants are known to suppress leakage currents by neutralizing excessive holes through the multivalence nature of Mn ions , the residual holes were further mitigated by the subsequent N2 annealing. The reducing atmosphere provided by N2 annealing facilitated the generation of free electrons, as shown in Eq. , which counteracted the holes. This defect passivation process was particularly evident in the LNQ sample, where the rapid cooling limited the charge-balancing effect of multivalent Mn. As a result, the LNQ sample relied more heavily on the subsequent N2 annealing step to effectively neutralize the excessive holes. Additionally, N atoms may be incorporated into the lattice during N2 annealing, potentially filling oxygen vacancy sites and further contributing to the passivation of defects. illustrates the P-E hysteresis curves of the AC and LNQ samples before and after N2 passivation, shown in a and b, respectively. The corresponding Wrec and \u03b7 are presented in c and d. The slimming of the hysteresis loops after N2 passivation highlights a significant reduction in losses, resulting in notable enhancements in energy storage performance for both sample types. For the LNQ sample, N2 annealing substantially increased P max and decreased P r, leading to improved energy storage characteristics with Wrec and \u03b7 reaching close to 12.0 J/cmE^{3} and 70% at an applied electric field of 680 kV/cm, respectively. In contrast, the AC sample exhibited lower P max than the LNQ sample, both before and after N2 passivation, resulting in a correspondingly lower Wrec. Consequently, \u03b7 typically decreases before reaching a plateau unless leakage effects persist, which would continuously elevate the P r value. A combination of a large P max and a small P r is essential for achieving optimal Wrec and \u03b7. d further demonstrates that prior to N2 annealing, the LNQ sample experienced a decline in efficiency at higher electric fields due to leakage effects. This degradation was effectively mitigated after N2 annealing, underscoring the success of defect passivation through N2 heat treatment. For the AC sample, leakage was minimal even before N2 annealing, resulting in comparable efficiencies before and after passivation. compares the Wrec and \u03b7 values of the AC and LNQ samples with N2 passivation from this study to those reported for similar thin-film systems in the literature. To ensure a fair comparison, only lead-free perovskite thin films with thicknesses between 200 and 350 nm and measured under a maximum applied electric field of less than 2000 kV/cm were included. The data in demonstrate that the AC and LNQ samples with N2 passivation rank among the top performers in energy storage, offering an excellent combination of high Wrec and \u03b7 values. Instead, it focuses on demonstrating how variations in the cooling process can be strategically utilized to tailor the ferroelectric, domain, and energy storage properties of BNT-based thin films.
