Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'solid phase sintering', 'precursors': ['Bi2O3', 'Fe2O3', 'TiO2', 'BaCO3', 'Al2O3', 'ZnO'], 'steps': ['Weighed raw materials according to the chemical formula', 'Ball-milled for 24 h', 'Pre-fired in a muffle furnace at 780 °C for 4h at a heating rate of 2 °C/min', 'Added 8 wt% PVA as a binder', 'Pressed into 8 mm diameter disks at a uniaxial pressure of 12 MPa', 'Sintered at 600 °C for 3 h to remove PVA', 'Sintered at 1000 °C for 6 h to obtain ceramic wafers', 'Polarized ceramic discs with double-sided silver electrodes in silicon oil at 120 °C under a DC field of 5 kV/cm for 20 min'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'SEM', 'TEM', 'high-temperature in-situ d33 measurement', 'LCR analyzer', 'ferroelectric detection system']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
