# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The gradual evolution of the pseudocubic {111}pc, {200}pc and {220}pc Bragg peaks profiles of (1-x)PbTiO3-(x)BiScO3 (0.36\u2264x \u22640.40) with composition (x) is shown in (a). The Bragg intensity of the rhombohedral / monoclinic phase is pronounced at x = 0.365. At x = 0.365, the rhombohedral / monoclinic phase's Bragg intensity is very strong, with increase in BiScO3 concentration (x), the height or intensity of the monoclinic peak steadily grows. For composition with x = 0.39, the monoclinic peaks dominate the pattern and the tetragonal peaks in the tail or background region are barely visible. Complete pattern fitting of XRD data was performed using the Rietveld method using a tetragonal (P4mm) + monoclinic (Cm) average structure. It should be observed that the compositions x = 0.40 and x = 0.36 appear to be pure rhombohedral / monoclinic and tetragonal phases, respectively, but the structural model fit was enhanced when the second sub phase or minor phase was included. Similarly, we have present Bragg peak profile of (1-x)PbTiO3-(x)Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 (0.35\u2264x\u22640.42) with composition (x) respectively in (b). The {111}pc profile remains singlet in all compositions and indicates the CL phase. Based on this visual examination of the Bragg profile, the overall pattern fit of the XRD data was performed using the Rietveld method with a tetragonal (P4mm) + cubic (Pm3\u0305m) average structure. It should be emphasized that the cubic (Pm3\u0305m) structure used here is for convenience only and does not represent the true structure, as will be disclosed in the following section. These two structural phase coexistence models of (P4mm) + cubic (Pm3\u0305m) fits the data very well. It can note that although the components x = 0.40, 0.42 and x = 0.35 appeared as pure and quaternary CL, respectively, the fit improved as the phase the second smallest is included in the structural model. (a) and 2 (d) shows the composition dependence lattice parameters of PT-BS and PT-BNH systems. As it can be seen clearly in (a), Lattice parameters \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 increases while \u2018c\u2019 decreases for monoclinic with increase in x (composition), similarly with increasing x, the tetragonal 'a' parameter grows, whereas the 'c' parameter decreases. While in (d) tetragonal \u2018a\u2019 parameter increases, and the \u2018c\u2019 parameter decreases with increasing x. This becomes more apparent with tetragonal (c / a) compositional changes ((b) and 2 (e)). SEM micrograph of PT-BS with x = 0.3725 and PT-BNH with x = 0.39 are shown in (a) and 3 (b) respectively. The average grain size was found to approximately (4\u20135 \xb5m) for these sample. Short correlation length is the indication of presence of nano polar region which is well known in the case of relaxor ferroelectric similar to PT-BNH system to show high piezoelectric property. Thus an optimum coherent length results in like high piezoelectricity. (c, f) depicts that variation of longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) of PT-BS and PT-BNH with composition. It is evident from (c, f) that d 33 drastically enhanced in the intermediate composition range decreasing on each side of the MPB, demarcating the MPB area. In the unpoled state of the PT-BNH for the x = 0.39 (large piezoelectric response) tetragonal and cubic similar phases coexist, similar to ordinary MPB systems of PT-BS, where the phase coexistence of tetragonal and rhombohedral/monoclinic regions, there is a strong piezoelectric response. Except for PT-BNZ and PT-BS , this d 33 value is comparable or higher than that of several other reported Bi/Pb-based MPB solid solutions such as 0.63Bi(Mg1/2Ti1/2)O3-0.37PbTiO3 , 0.51Bi(Ni1/2Ti1/2)O3-0.49PbTiO3 , 0.38Bi(Mg3/4W1/4)O3-0.62PbTiO3 , 0.35Bi(Ni2/3Nb1/3)O3-0.65PbTiO3. (a, c) shows the electric field driven phase transformations in PT-BS and PT-BNH. To study the effect of electric field in PT-BS and PT-BNH, pellets of various compositions of PT-BS and PT-BNH were poled at 40 kV/cm on silicon oil bath at room temperature. The poled pellets were crushed into fine powders and XRD pattern was recorded. We have observed from (a) {002}pc/{200}pc XRD profiles which appear to be triplet for the composition with x = 0.3725 in the unpoled state [ (left panel)] unpoled state does not fully transform into tetragonal phase with fraction of rhombohedral phase still persisting after applied electric field. Similarly, the {111}pc XRD peak remains doublet reveals the rhombohedral/monoclinic phase. For the MPB compositions with x = 0.365 \u2013 0.39, similar trend obtained for unpoled and poled samples. As can be seen from (c) that {002}pc/{200}pc XRD profiles which appear to be singlet for the composition with x = 0.40 in the unpoled state [ (right panel)] splitted into two peaks after applied electric field. The {111}pc XRD peak is remain singlet reveals the tetragonal structure for x = 0.40. For the MPB compositions with x = 0.36 \u2013 0.39, similar trend obtained for poled samples. Pseudocubic reflections {200}pc which have triplet nature (for x = 0.36\u20130.39) in unpoled state [ (right panel)] transform in tetragonal phase with doublet {002}pc/{200}pc reflections. (b) and 4 (d) shows the variation of tetragonality (c/a) of poled samples on application of electric field. The tetragonality of poled samples is higher than that of annealed samples of PT-BNH, while no significant changes in tetragonality is observed after poling in conventional PT-BS (MPB) systems. (a) and (b) shows the high temperature dielectric permittivity of PT-BS with x = 0.3725 and PT-BNH with x = 0.39 respectively. In relaxor ferroelectric PT-BNH dielectric permittivity continuously decreases with increasing the frequency. All these features indicate the relaxor nature of PT-BNH. Relaxors are characterized by the presence of local structural heterogeneities and their domains are in form of polar nano regions (PNRs). At very high temperature well above the TC, the PNR transform to the high symmetry cubic phase rendering the material paraelectric. On contrary PT-BS with x = 0.3725 shows conventional ferroelectric behavior where TC remains unchanged with frequency. The ferroelectric-paraelectric transition peak is sharper in comparison to PT-BNH x = 0.39 which has a diffused peak. Prior studies have reported similar characteristics for the (MPB) PT-BS with x = 0.3725 composition. We carried out high temperature XRD measurement on poled composition of PT-BNH with x = 0.39. For this, pellet was poled at 40 kV/cm on room temperature and crushed into fine powder. (a) - (d) displays the evolution of the pseudocubic {200}pc Bragg profile of poled (1-x)PT-(x)BNH (x = 0.39) with temperature, variation of lattice parameter, unit cell volume, and tetragonality (c/a) of poled (1-x)PT-(x)BNH (x = 0.39) with temperature, respectively. shows room temperature Raman spectra of representative compositions of (1-x)PT-(x)BS and (1-x)PT-(x)BNH specimens in their unpoled and poled states. Lorentzian fitting was carried out to the Raman data of the specimens after correcting the Bose-Einstein factor. (a) and (e) show the Lorentzian curve fitting of unpoled MPB PT-BS composition (x = 0.3725) and pseudo-MPB PT-BNH composition (x = 0.39), respectively. Following earlier literatures , the Raman spectra were fitted with nine different peaks (modes) \u2013 (1) E(TO1)\u223c65 cmE^{\u22121}, (2) E(LO1) \u223c76 cmE^{\u22121}, (3) A1(1TO) \u223c191 cmE^{\u22121}, (4) E(2TO) \u223c 272.2 cmE^{\u22121}, (5) (B1 + E) \u223c 330 cmE^{\u22121}, (6) A1(2TO) \u223c 387.6 cmE^{\u22121}, (7) E(3TO) \u223c 497.8 cmE^{\u22121}, (8) TO3(A1 +E) \u223c556 cmE^{\u22121}, and (9) A1(3TO) \u223c607 cmE^{\u22121} respectively. Peaks 1 and 2 (E (TO1) mode) arise due to the A-O vibrational mode (for perovskite with general formula ABO3). Peak 3 corresponds to the A-B site coupling, and peaks 4\u20136 are associated B-O vibrational mode. Peaks 7\u20139 arise from the oxygen translatory motion associated with the oxygen octahedral. For example, the A1(1TO) mode has been recorded at \u223c180 cmE^{\u22121} for 0.59PbTiO3-0.41Bi(Ni1/2Zr1/2)O3 , \u223c185 cmE^{\u22121} for 0.4PbTiO3-0.6BiFeO3 and at \u223c172 cmE^{\u22121} in 0.65PbTiO3-0.35 Bi(Zn1/2Ti1/2)O3 , and \u223c185 cmE^{\u22121} in 0.66PbTiO3-0.34 BiScO3. In the A-BO3 translational mode vibration, the A1(1TO) mode is related with off-center polar displacement of A-site cations (BiE^{3+/}PbE^{2+}) with respect to BO6 octahedra. Noticeable softening (\u0394\u03c9 = 10 cmE^{\u22121}) in the (B1 + E) mode (peak 5) is observed after poling in x = 0.3725 of PT-BS, (c). Mode softening in the Raman spectra indicates field induced local structural transformation in the MPB PT-BS composition which complies with the field induced structural transformation at a global length scale as per XRPD. No obvious mode softening is observed upon poling in x = 0.36 and x = 0.40 of PT-BS, (b) and 7 (d). Similarity in the profile of Raman spectra of PT-BNH compositions ((f) \u22127 (h)) in the unpoled state suggests invariant local structural symmetry across the compositions. Therefore, what globally appears as cubic like structure (XRPD pattern), is essentially has tetragonal symmetry with smaller co-relation length. In pure tetragonal PbTiO3 the A site is being occupied with Pb and B site with Ti as we \u0111ope BNH in the system, Bismuth competes with Pb on A sites and NH with Ti on B site. Though we see no additional Raman signature confirming no change in tetragonal structure but broadening of the Raman peaks can be seen as we increase the concentration of BNH in the system. This is expected as multiple ions on A and B sites compete and with vibrational frequency\u2019s very near to each other thus contributing to very close Raman peaks which is reflected as broadening. depicts the compares of the room-temperature PDFs of the poled and unpoled specimens of PT-BS with x = 0.3725 and PT-BNH with x = 0.39 samples extracted from the x-ray scattering data for the range of inter atomic distances (r). Therefore, we have observed in PT-BS and in PT-BNH alloys unpoled, the pair correlations from3.0 to 4.5 \xc5 [see (c, d)] mainly refer to the nearest-neighbor A/B-A/B correlations. The others peaks are assigned as \u223c3.38 \xc5 correspond to nearest-neighbor A-B pairs, while that at \u223c3.94 \xc5 by nearest-neighbor A-A and B-B pairs. However, a general observation is that the local structural features in unpoled and poled of PT-BS with x = 0.3725 [(c, e)] remain, at least visibly, very similar in terms of nearest-neighbor distances, while local structural observation of unpoled and poled of PT-BNH with x = 0.39 in (d, f) some visible changes in nearest neighbor distances. Therefore, we have extracted some first-hand quantitative information, the peaks from 3.0 to 4.5 \xc5 were fitted with two Gaussians (minimum number of peaks required to follow the feature) as shown in (d) for PT-BNH with x = 0.39. Compare unpoled (c) and poled (e) of PT-BS with x = 03725, which shows no significant change in FWHM and bond distances due in both samples shows coexistence of monoclinic and tetragonal phases, which is clearly seen in x-ray pattern [ left panel unpoled state and (a) poled state]. It is clear that from (d, e) clearly indicate that the changes in the peaks at \u223c3.5 \xc5, which arise from the nearest Pb/Bi-(Ni, Hf, Ti) pairs, exhibit obvious changes after poling. According to the definition of PDF, this behavior implies a significant bond length change between B-site atoms and their adjacent Pb/Bi atoms. Another observation is that the peak at \u223c4.02 \xc5 shows almost no shift after poling. The peak at \u223c4.02 \xc5 corresponds to the A-A/B-B atom pair\u2019s parallel to < 100 > direction, which is the polar axis of the tetragonal. In (d) unpoled and 8 (e) poled of PT-BNH with x = 0.39, the widening of the distribution of displacements for the A-site cations in unpoled state as compare to poled state have significant and steady decrease in the FWHM of first peak.

# TITLE
Comparative analysis of electromechanical performance of morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) based normal ferroelectric and non-MPB based relaxor ferroelectric perovskites

# ABSTRACT
In the present work, we demonstrate that one can obtain comparable properties in composition far from Morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) by tuning the correlation length of polar-structural ordering in single phase relaxor ferroelectric perovskite. We examined this idea by a comparative structure-property analysis of a ferroelectric system (1-x) PbTiO3-(x)BiScO3 (PT-BS) (d33 â¼500 pC/N at MPB) and a non-MPB (1-x)PbTiO3-(x)Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 (PT-BNH) system (d33 â¼425 pC/N at pseudo-MPB). Structural analysis of x-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) data of MPB (xâ¯=â¯0.3725) composition of (1-x) PbTiO3-(x)BiScO3 (PT-BS) shows tetragonal +â¯rhombohedral/monoclinic phase co-existence and there is a increment in tetragonal structural phase fraction at the cost of rhombohedral phase after poling, resulting in large piezoelectric property. On the other hand XRPD data of pseudo-MPB (xâ¯=â¯0.39) composition of (1-x)PbTiO3-(x)Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 (PT-BNH) shows cubic like (CL) +â¯tetragonal phase co-existence and tetragonal structural phase fraction increases at the cost of co-existing cubic like phase upon poling, giving rise to the piezoelectric property comparable to that of MPB PT-BS. Our analysis suggests that increased polar-structure heterogeneity at the non-MPB composition can result in large piezoelectric response and requirement of a MPB composition is not a necessary criterion to obtain enhanced electromechanical property.

# INTRODUCTION
Lead Zirconium Titanate (PZT) based ferroelectric and piezoelectric alloys are one of the most coveted materials for actuator, pressure sensors, memory devices, transducers and communication wide range applications. While this has propelled to the study and discovery of new lead-free alloys which are mainly classified into BaTiO3-based , BiFeO3-based , Na1/2Bi1/2TiO3-based and K1/2Na1/2NbO3-based systems, drawbacks such as low Curie point (BaTiO3-based systems), issue of property reproducibility owing to the equal probability of formation of FeE^{2 +} and FeE^{3+} (BiFeO3\u2013based system) low longitudinal piezoelectric responses (Na1/2Bi1/2TiO3-based systems), and the difficulty in replicating the appropriate structural phases and property because of the high susceptibility to even minute alteration in synthesis condition [(K, Na)NbO3 (KNN)-based systems], are serious obstructions which are hampering the commercial use and acceptance of these Pb free piezoelectric ceramics. In addition, as a result of the oblique polymorphic phase boundaries / morphotropic phase boundaries (PPB/MPB) of these systems, temperature sensitivity to electromechanical and piezoelectric characteristics is significant, which is undesirable from a device perspective. This has led researchers to focus on Bi/Pb-based piezoelectric systems and new MPB based piezoelectric ceramics. MPB compositions, by virtue of inter-ferroelectric structural instability exhibit large electromechanical responses. Many types of Bi/Pb-based MPB perovskite have been previously investigated, some of which even show a higher Curie temperature (TC) than PZT, this is very useful for application at elevated or high temperature. After, the perusal of literature for the high TC piezoelectric ceramics, A solid solution of of (1-x)BiScO3\u2013xPbTiO3 (BS\u2013PT) was studied. It has a transition temperature (TC \u223c 460E^{\u1d52}C) higher than that of PZT (\u223c 400E^{\u1d52}C) and shows an incredible piezoelectric response near MPB at x \u223c 0.64. Several other Bi/Pb-based solid solutions such as (1-x)Bi(Ni1/2Ti1/2)O3\u2013xPbTiO3 , (1-x)Bi(Ni1/2Zr1/2)O3\u2013xPbTiO3 , (1-x)Bi(Zn1/2Ti1/2)O3\u2013xPbTiO3 , (1-x)Bi(Mg1/2Ti1/2)O3\u2013xPbTiO3 , (Bi1/2Na1/2)TiO3\u2013BaTiO3\u2013(Bi1/2K1/2)TiO3 , (1-x)Bi(Mg1/2Zr1/2)O3\u2013xPbTiO3 , (1-x)Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3\u2013xPbTiO3 have been explored; Some of Bi/Pb-based alloys exhibit good piezoelectric response. For achieving a good piezoelectric response apart from an optimized tetragonality, the solid solubility range should be such that the system settles in a coexistence of ferroelectric phases resulting in formation of morphotropic phase boundary (MPB). Some prominent Bi/Pb based solid solution systems showing a high electromechanical (d 33) response are PbTiO3-BiScO3 (PT-BS) (d 33\u223c450 pC/N) and (1-x)Bi(Ni1/2Zr1/2)O3-xPbTiO3 ((1-x)BNZ-xPT) (d 33\u223c400 pC/N). Recently, a new alloy system in this category namely PbTiO3-Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 has reported with exceptional piezoelectric properties (d 33 \u223c446 pC/N). Based on structure, there is a significant difference between the Bi/Pb-based MPBs and conventional Pb-based MPBs. Traditional Pb-based MPB systems such as PZT and PMNPT show the coexistence of ferroelectric and tetragonal and rhombohedral / monoclinic phases. In contrast, the coexisting phases in Bi/Pb-based (except BS-PT) systems are mostly reported as tetragonal and \u201ccubic-like\u201d. Pandey et al. reported these types of binary system (alloys) which can be termed as non-conventional MPB systems. In recent times, some research groups have argued that structural mechanism is most probably to be prepotent phenomenon or mechanism associated with the enhanced piezoelectric response in conventional MPB systems. The non-conventional MPB compositions of Bi/Pb-based (except BS-PT) have not received such a detailed investigation of the mechanisms associated with those large piezoelectric responses. The clarity regarding the structural state is the first and foremost requirement for gaining better insight about the possible mechanism(s) in these non-conventional MPB systems. Building on this, it is decided to perform a comprehensive comparison of the crystal structure and piezoelectric response of PT-BS (MPB) and PT-BNH (non-MPB) solid solution. It is found that the piezoelectric response (d 33) in PT-BS in MPB region is very similar to that in PT-BNH (non-MPB) region i.e in excess of \u223c400 pC/N. This would allow a meaningful comparison of the properties and the mechanisms between PT-BS and PT-BNH and help understand the mechanisms better through examination of the similarities/differences pertaining to the structural mechanisms in the two systems. Using complementary experimental approaches such as electric-field and temperature dependent x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, dielectric, piezoelectric measurements, and x-ray PDF for a thorough examination and analysis. It is observed that the entire MPB region of the PT-BS composition has coexistence of low symmetry tetragonal and monoclinic phases, while structure of PT-BNH has coexistence of low symmetry tetragonal and high symmetry cubic phases at room temperature. In PT-BS, unpoled state does not fully transform into tetragonal phase with fraction of rhombohedral phase persisting after applied electric field, while in PT-BNH cubic like phase fully transform into tetragonal phase in the global scale after application of electric field. Interestingly, the Raman spectra, which probes the structural state on local scale, shows some differences in the unpoled and poled spectrum in PT-BS MPB systems while, no distinction is seen between unpoled and poled Raman spectrum in PT-BNH systems, thereby suggesting that on a small length scale the structure is still tetragonal, which appears to be a cubic-like phase globally. The study reveals the fundamental contrast between the conventional MPB and non-conventional MPB piezoelectric by showing that the appearance of coexistence of two phases on the global scale in our non-conventional MPB system is due to coexistence of short range and long ranged tetragonal domains. We also show that the x-ray PDFs of PT-BS does not significant change in unpoled and poled state due to coexistence of two phases in both states. The variations in the peaks at 3.5, which result from the closest Pb/Bi-(Ni, Hf, Ti) pairings, are clearly indicated by PT-BNH are a result of poling which is also evident from the peak height increase after poling. This behavior is defined as a considerable change in interatomic distance atoms at between B site and their surrounding Pb / Bi atoms, according to the PDF description. In the current research work, the comparative analysis of electromechanical performance of morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) based normal ferroelectric and non-MPB based relaxor ferroelectric perovskites is focused to reveal its hidden characteristics of electromechanical performances for getting the fruitful advantages in the various fields of applications. MPB has applications in many fields, including DRAM cell capacitance, technical constraints of DRAM, and stress engineering.

# CONCLUSION
From the above results and discussion, the following points can be drawn: \u2022 The large electromechanical response is observed in PbTiO3-BiScO3 (PT-BS) (d 33 \u223c500 pC/N) MPB and PbTiO3-Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 (PT-BNH) (d 33 \u223c425 pC/N) non-MPB systems, respectively. \u2022 Structural analysis of MPB (x = 0.3725) composition of PbTiO3-BiScO3 (PT-BS) shows tetragonal + rhombohedral / monoclinic phase co-existence with tetragonal phase. \u2022 On the other hand for (x = 0.39) composition of PbTiO3-Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 (PT-BNH) shows cubic like (CL) + tetragonal phase co-existence (non-MPB) and tetragonal phase. \u2022 Raman spectra and x-ray pair distribution analysis show that the cubic like phase is miniaturized domains with tetragonal symmetry and its correlation length increases upon poling. \u2022 Structural analysis of PT-BNH revealed that unpoled structure CL and tetragonal domain transform to tetragonal on poling. \u2022 Morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) compositions, by feature of inter-ferroelectric structural instability exhibit large electromechanical responses. \u2022 It can be clearly stabilized that inter ferroelectric instability is not solely responsible for superior piezoelectric response and structural heterogeneity can play a huge role in enhancing the piezoelectric properties. The large electromechanical response is observed in PbTiO3-BiScO3 (PT-BS) (d 33 \u223c500 pC/N) MPB and PbTiO3-Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 (PT-BNH) (d 33 \u223c425 pC/N) non-MPB systems, respectively. Structural analysis of MPB (x = 0.3725) composition of PbTiO3-BiScO3 (PT-BS) shows tetragonal + rhombohedral / monoclinic phase co-existence with tetragonal phase. On the other hand for (x = 0.39) composition of PbTiO3-Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 (PT-BNH) shows cubic like (CL) + tetragonal phase co-existence (non-MPB) and tetragonal phase. Structural analysis of PT-BNH revealed that unpoled structure CL and tetragonal domain transform to tetragonal on poling. Morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) compositions, by feature of inter-ferroelectric structural instability exhibit large electromechanical responses.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The gradual evolution of the pseudocubic {111}pc, {200}pc and {220}pc Bragg peaks profiles of (1-x)PbTiO3-(x)BiScO3 (0.36\u2264x \u22640.40) with composition (x) is shown in (a). The Bragg intensity of the rhombohedral / monoclinic phase is pronounced at x = 0.365. At x = 0.365, the rhombohedral / monoclinic phase's Bragg intensity is very strong, with increase in BiScO3 concentration (x), the height or intensity of the monoclinic peak steadily grows. For composition with x = 0.39, the monoclinic peaks dominate the pattern and the tetragonal peaks in the tail or background region are barely visible. Complete pattern fitting of XRD data was performed using the Rietveld method using a tetragonal (P4mm) + monoclinic (Cm) average structure. It should be observed that the compositions x = 0.40 and x = 0.36 appear to be pure rhombohedral / monoclinic and tetragonal phases, respectively, but the structural model fit was enhanced when the second sub phase or minor phase was included. Similarly, we have present Bragg peak profile of (1-x)PbTiO3-(x)Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 (0.35\u2264x\u22640.42) with composition (x) respectively in (b). The {111}pc profile remains singlet in all compositions and indicates the CL phase. Based on this visual examination of the Bragg profile, the overall pattern fit of the XRD data was performed using the Rietveld method with a tetragonal (P4mm) + cubic (Pm3\u0305m) average structure. It should be emphasized that the cubic (Pm3\u0305m) structure used here is for convenience only and does not represent the true structure, as will be disclosed in the following section. These two structural phase coexistence models of (P4mm) + cubic (Pm3\u0305m) fits the data very well. It can note that although the components x = 0.40, 0.42 and x = 0.35 appeared as pure and quaternary CL, respectively, the fit improved as the phase the second smallest is included in the structural model. (a) and 2 (d) shows the composition dependence lattice parameters of PT-BS and PT-BNH systems. As it can be seen clearly in (a), Lattice parameters \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 increases while \u2018c\u2019 decreases for monoclinic with increase in x (composition), similarly with increasing x, the tetragonal 'a' parameter grows, whereas the 'c' parameter decreases. While in (d) tetragonal \u2018a\u2019 parameter increases, and the \u2018c\u2019 parameter decreases with increasing x. This becomes more apparent with tetragonal (c / a) compositional changes ((b) and 2 (e)). SEM micrograph of PT-BS with x = 0.3725 and PT-BNH with x = 0.39 are shown in (a) and 3 (b) respectively. The average grain size was found to approximately (4\u20135 \xb5m) for these sample. Short correlation length is the indication of presence of nano polar region which is well known in the case of relaxor ferroelectric similar to PT-BNH system to show high piezoelectric property. Thus an optimum coherent length results in like high piezoelectricity. (c, f) depicts that variation of longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) of PT-BS and PT-BNH with composition. It is evident from (c, f) that d 33 drastically enhanced in the intermediate composition range decreasing on each side of the MPB, demarcating the MPB area. In the unpoled state of the PT-BNH for the x = 0.39 (large piezoelectric response) tetragonal and cubic similar phases coexist, similar to ordinary MPB systems of PT-BS, where the phase coexistence of tetragonal and rhombohedral/monoclinic regions, there is a strong piezoelectric response. Except for PT-BNZ and PT-BS , this d 33 value is comparable or higher than that of several other reported Bi/Pb-based MPB solid solutions such as 0.63Bi(Mg1/2Ti1/2)O3-0.37PbTiO3 , 0.51Bi(Ni1/2Ti1/2)O3-0.49PbTiO3 , 0.38Bi(Mg3/4W1/4)O3-0.62PbTiO3 , 0.35Bi(Ni2/3Nb1/3)O3-0.65PbTiO3. (a, c) shows the electric field driven phase transformations in PT-BS and PT-BNH. To study the effect of electric field in PT-BS and PT-BNH, pellets of various compositions of PT-BS and PT-BNH were poled at 40 kV/cm on silicon oil bath at room temperature. The poled pellets were crushed into fine powders and XRD pattern was recorded. We have observed from (a) {002}pc/{200}pc XRD profiles which appear to be triplet for the composition with x = 0.3725 in the unpoled state [ (left panel)] unpoled state does not fully transform into tetragonal phase with fraction of rhombohedral phase still persisting after applied electric field. Similarly, the {111}pc XRD peak remains doublet reveals the rhombohedral/monoclinic phase. For the MPB compositions with x = 0.365 \u2013 0.39, similar trend obtained for unpoled and poled samples. As can be seen from (c) that {002}pc/{200}pc XRD profiles which appear to be singlet for the composition with x = 0.40 in the unpoled state [ (right panel)] splitted into two peaks after applied electric field. The {111}pc XRD peak is remain singlet reveals the tetragonal structure for x = 0.40. For the MPB compositions with x = 0.36 \u2013 0.39, similar trend obtained for poled samples. Pseudocubic reflections {200}pc which have triplet nature (for x = 0.36\u20130.39) in unpoled state [ (right panel)] transform in tetragonal phase with doublet {002}pc/{200}pc reflections. (b) and 4 (d) shows the variation of tetragonality (c/a) of poled samples on application of electric field. The tetragonality of poled samples is higher than that of annealed samples of PT-BNH, while no significant changes in tetragonality is observed after poling in conventional PT-BS (MPB) systems. (a) and (b) shows the high temperature dielectric permittivity of PT-BS with x = 0.3725 and PT-BNH with x = 0.39 respectively. In relaxor ferroelectric PT-BNH dielectric permittivity continuously decreases with increasing the frequency. All these features indicate the relaxor nature of PT-BNH. Relaxors are characterized by the presence of local structural heterogeneities and their domains are in form of polar nano regions (PNRs). At very high temperature well above the TC, the PNR transform to the high symmetry cubic phase rendering the material paraelectric. On contrary PT-BS with x = 0.3725 shows conventional ferroelectric behavior where TC remains unchanged with frequency. The ferroelectric-paraelectric transition peak is sharper in comparison to PT-BNH x = 0.39 which has a diffused peak. Prior studies have reported similar characteristics for the (MPB) PT-BS with x = 0.3725 composition. We carried out high temperature XRD measurement on poled composition of PT-BNH with x = 0.39. For this, pellet was poled at 40 kV/cm on room temperature and crushed into fine powder. (a) - (d) displays the evolution of the pseudocubic {200}pc Bragg profile of poled (1-x)PT-(x)BNH (x = 0.39) with temperature, variation of lattice parameter, unit cell volume, and tetragonality (c/a) of poled (1-x)PT-(x)BNH (x = 0.39) with temperature, respectively. shows room temperature Raman spectra of representative compositions of (1-x)PT-(x)BS and (1-x)PT-(x)BNH specimens in their unpoled and poled states. Lorentzian fitting was carried out to the Raman data of the specimens after correcting the Bose-Einstein factor. (a) and (e) show the Lorentzian curve fitting of unpoled MPB PT-BS composition (x = 0.3725) and pseudo-MPB PT-BNH composition (x = 0.39), respectively. Following earlier literatures , the Raman spectra were fitted with nine different peaks (modes) \u2013 (1) E(TO1)\u223c65 cmE^{\u22121}, (2) E(LO1) \u223c76 cmE^{\u22121}, (3) A1(1TO) \u223c191 cmE^{\u22121}, (4) E(2TO) \u223c 272.2 cmE^{\u22121}, (5) (B1 + E) \u223c 330 cmE^{\u22121}, (6) A1(2TO) \u223c 387.6 cmE^{\u22121}, (7) E(3TO) \u223c 497.8 cmE^{\u22121}, (8) TO3(A1 +E) \u223c556 cmE^{\u22121}, and (9) A1(3TO) \u223c607 cmE^{\u22121} respectively. Peaks 1 and 2 (E (TO1) mode) arise due to the A-O vibrational mode (for perovskite with general formula ABO3). Peak 3 corresponds to the A-B site coupling, and peaks 4\u20136 are associated B-O vibrational mode. Peaks 7\u20139 arise from the oxygen translatory motion associated with the oxygen octahedral. For example, the A1(1TO) mode has been recorded at \u223c180 cmE^{\u22121} for 0.59PbTiO3-0.41Bi(Ni1/2Zr1/2)O3 , \u223c185 cmE^{\u22121} for 0.4PbTiO3-0.6BiFeO3 and at \u223c172 cmE^{\u22121} in 0.65PbTiO3-0.35 Bi(Zn1/2Ti1/2)O3 , and \u223c185 cmE^{\u22121} in 0.66PbTiO3-0.34 BiScO3. In the A-BO3 translational mode vibration, the A1(1TO) mode is related with off-center polar displacement of A-site cations (BiE^{3+/}PbE^{2+}) with respect to BO6 octahedra. Noticeable softening (\u0394\u03c9 = 10 cmE^{\u22121}) in the (B1 + E) mode (peak 5) is observed after poling in x = 0.3725 of PT-BS, (c). Mode softening in the Raman spectra indicates field induced local structural transformation in the MPB PT-BS composition which complies with the field induced structural transformation at a global length scale as per XRPD. No obvious mode softening is observed upon poling in x = 0.36 and x = 0.40 of PT-BS, (b) and 7 (d). Similarity in the profile of Raman spectra of PT-BNH compositions ((f) \u22127 (h)) in the unpoled state suggests invariant local structural symmetry across the compositions. Therefore, what globally appears as cubic like structure (XRPD pattern), is essentially has tetragonal symmetry with smaller co-relation length. In pure tetragonal PbTiO3 the A site is being occupied with Pb and B site with Ti as we \u0111ope BNH in the system, Bismuth competes with Pb on A sites and NH with Ti on B site. Though we see no additional Raman signature confirming no change in tetragonal structure but broadening of the Raman peaks can be seen as we increase the concentration of BNH in the system. This is expected as multiple ions on A and B sites compete and with vibrational frequency\u2019s very near to each other thus contributing to very close Raman peaks which is reflected as broadening. depicts the compares of the room-temperature PDFs of the poled and unpoled specimens of PT-BS with x = 0.3725 and PT-BNH with x = 0.39 samples extracted from the x-ray scattering data for the range of inter atomic distances (r). Therefore, we have observed in PT-BS and in PT-BNH alloys unpoled, the pair correlations from3.0 to 4.5 \xc5 [see (c, d)] mainly refer to the nearest-neighbor A/B-A/B correlations. The others peaks are assigned as \u223c3.38 \xc5 correspond to nearest-neighbor A-B pairs, while that at \u223c3.94 \xc5 by nearest-neighbor A-A and B-B pairs. However, a general observation is that the local structural features in unpoled and poled of PT-BS with x = 0.3725 [(c, e)] remain, at least visibly, very similar in terms of nearest-neighbor distances, while local structural observation of unpoled and poled of PT-BNH with x = 0.39 in (d, f) some visible changes in nearest neighbor distances. Therefore, we have extracted some first-hand quantitative information, the peaks from 3.0 to 4.5 \xc5 were fitted with two Gaussians (minimum number of peaks required to follow the feature) as shown in (d) for PT-BNH with x = 0.39. Compare unpoled (c) and poled (e) of PT-BS with x = 03725, which shows no significant change in FWHM and bond distances due in both samples shows coexistence of monoclinic and tetragonal phases, which is clearly seen in x-ray pattern [ left panel unpoled state and (a) poled state]. It is clear that from (d, e) clearly indicate that the changes in the peaks at \u223c3.5 \xc5, which arise from the nearest Pb/Bi-(Ni, Hf, Ti) pairs, exhibit obvious changes after poling. According to the definition of PDF, this behavior implies a significant bond length change between B-site atoms and their adjacent Pb/Bi atoms. Another observation is that the peak at \u223c4.02 \xc5 shows almost no shift after poling. The peak at \u223c4.02 \xc5 corresponds to the A-A/B-B atom pair\u2019s parallel to < 100 > direction, which is the polar axis of the tetragonal. In (d) unpoled and 8 (e) poled of PT-BNH with x = 0.39, the widening of the distribution of displacements for the A-site cations in unpoled state as compare to poled state have significant and steady decrease in the FWHM of first peak.

# TITLE
Comparative analysis of electromechanical performance of morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) based normal ferroelectric and non-MPB based relaxor ferroelectric perovskites

# ABSTRACT
In the present work, we demonstrate that one can obtain comparable properties in composition far from Morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) by tuning the correlation length of polar-structural ordering in single phase relaxor ferroelectric perovskite. We examined this idea by a comparative structure-property analysis of a ferroelectric system (1-x) PbTiO3-(x)BiScO3 (PT-BS) (d33 â¼500 pC/N at MPB) and a non-MPB (1-x)PbTiO3-(x)Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 (PT-BNH) system (d33 â¼425 pC/N at pseudo-MPB). Structural analysis of x-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) data of MPB (xâ¯=â¯0.3725) composition of (1-x) PbTiO3-(x)BiScO3 (PT-BS) shows tetragonal +â¯rhombohedral/monoclinic phase co-existence and there is a increment in tetragonal structural phase fraction at the cost of rhombohedral phase after poling, resulting in large piezoelectric property. On the other hand XRPD data of pseudo-MPB (xâ¯=â¯0.39) composition of (1-x)PbTiO3-(x)Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 (PT-BNH) shows cubic like (CL) +â¯tetragonal phase co-existence and tetragonal structural phase fraction increases at the cost of co-existing cubic like phase upon poling, giving rise to the piezoelectric property comparable to that of MPB PT-BS. Our analysis suggests that increased polar-structure heterogeneity at the non-MPB composition can result in large piezoelectric response and requirement of a MPB composition is not a necessary criterion to obtain enhanced electromechanical property.

# INTRODUCTION
Lead Zirconium Titanate (PZT) based ferroelectric and piezoelectric alloys are one of the most coveted materials for actuator, pressure sensors, memory devices, transducers and communication wide range applications. While this has propelled to the study and discovery of new lead-free alloys which are mainly classified into BaTiO3-based , BiFeO3-based , Na1/2Bi1/2TiO3-based and K1/2Na1/2NbO3-based systems, drawbacks such as low Curie point (BaTiO3-based systems), issue of property reproducibility owing to the equal probability of formation of FeE^{2 +} and FeE^{3+} (BiFeO3\u2013based system) low longitudinal piezoelectric responses (Na1/2Bi1/2TiO3-based systems), and the difficulty in replicating the appropriate structural phases and property because of the high susceptibility to even minute alteration in synthesis condition [(K, Na)NbO3 (KNN)-based systems], are serious obstructions which are hampering the commercial use and acceptance of these Pb free piezoelectric ceramics. In addition, as a result of the oblique polymorphic phase boundaries / morphotropic phase boundaries (PPB/MPB) of these systems, temperature sensitivity to electromechanical and piezoelectric characteristics is significant, which is undesirable from a device perspective. This has led researchers to focus on Bi/Pb-based piezoelectric systems and new MPB based piezoelectric ceramics. MPB compositions, by virtue of inter-ferroelectric structural instability exhibit large electromechanical responses. Many types of Bi/Pb-based MPB perovskite have been previously investigated, some of which even show a higher Curie temperature (TC) than PZT, this is very useful for application at elevated or high temperature. After, the perusal of literature for the high TC piezoelectric ceramics, A solid solution of of (1-x)BiScO3\u2013xPbTiO3 (BS\u2013PT) was studied. It has a transition temperature (TC \u223c 460E^{\u1d52}C) higher than that of PZT (\u223c 400E^{\u1d52}C) and shows an incredible piezoelectric response near MPB at x \u223c 0.64. Several other Bi/Pb-based solid solutions such as (1-x)Bi(Ni1/2Ti1/2)O3\u2013xPbTiO3 , (1-x)Bi(Ni1/2Zr1/2)O3\u2013xPbTiO3 , (1-x)Bi(Zn1/2Ti1/2)O3\u2013xPbTiO3 , (1-x)Bi(Mg1/2Ti1/2)O3\u2013xPbTiO3 , (Bi1/2Na1/2)TiO3\u2013BaTiO3\u2013(Bi1/2K1/2)TiO3 , (1-x)Bi(Mg1/2Zr1/2)O3\u2013xPbTiO3 , (1-x)Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3\u2013xPbTiO3 have been explored; Some of Bi/Pb-based alloys exhibit good piezoelectric response. For achieving a good piezoelectric response apart from an optimized tetragonality, the solid solubility range should be such that the system settles in a coexistence of ferroelectric phases resulting in formation of morphotropic phase boundary (MPB). Some prominent Bi/Pb based solid solution systems showing a high electromechanical (d 33) response are PbTiO3-BiScO3 (PT-BS) (d 33\u223c450 pC/N) and (1-x)Bi(Ni1/2Zr1/2)O3-xPbTiO3 ((1-x)BNZ-xPT) (d 33\u223c400 pC/N). Recently, a new alloy system in this category namely PbTiO3-Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 has reported with exceptional piezoelectric properties (d 33 \u223c446 pC/N). Based on structure, there is a significant difference between the Bi/Pb-based MPBs and conventional Pb-based MPBs. Traditional Pb-based MPB systems such as PZT and PMNPT show the coexistence of ferroelectric and tetragonal and rhombohedral / monoclinic phases. In contrast, the coexisting phases in Bi/Pb-based (except BS-PT) systems are mostly reported as tetragonal and \u201ccubic-like\u201d. Pandey et al. reported these types of binary system (alloys) which can be termed as non-conventional MPB systems. In recent times, some research groups have argued that structural mechanism is most probably to be prepotent phenomenon or mechanism associated with the enhanced piezoelectric response in conventional MPB systems. The non-conventional MPB compositions of Bi/Pb-based (except BS-PT) have not received such a detailed investigation of the mechanisms associated with those large piezoelectric responses. The clarity regarding the structural state is the first and foremost requirement for gaining better insight about the possible mechanism(s) in these non-conventional MPB systems. Building on this, it is decided to perform a comprehensive comparison of the crystal structure and piezoelectric response of PT-BS (MPB) and PT-BNH (non-MPB) solid solution. It is found that the piezoelectric response (d 33) in PT-BS in MPB region is very similar to that in PT-BNH (non-MPB) region i.e in excess of \u223c400 pC/N. This would allow a meaningful comparison of the properties and the mechanisms between PT-BS and PT-BNH and help understand the mechanisms better through examination of the similarities/differences pertaining to the structural mechanisms in the two systems. Using complementary experimental approaches such as electric-field and temperature dependent x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, dielectric, piezoelectric measurements, and x-ray PDF for a thorough examination and analysis. It is observed that the entire MPB region of the PT-BS composition has coexistence of low symmetry tetragonal and monoclinic phases, while structure of PT-BNH has coexistence of low symmetry tetragonal and high symmetry cubic phases at room temperature. In PT-BS, unpoled state does not fully transform into tetragonal phase with fraction of rhombohedral phase persisting after applied electric field, while in PT-BNH cubic like phase fully transform into tetragonal phase in the global scale after application of electric field. Interestingly, the Raman spectra, which probes the structural state on local scale, shows some differences in the unpoled and poled spectrum in PT-BS MPB systems while, no distinction is seen between unpoled and poled Raman spectrum in PT-BNH systems, thereby suggesting that on a small length scale the structure is still tetragonal, which appears to be a cubic-like phase globally. The study reveals the fundamental contrast between the conventional MPB and non-conventional MPB piezoelectric by showing that the appearance of coexistence of two phases on the global scale in our non-conventional MPB system is due to coexistence of short range and long ranged tetragonal domains. We also show that the x-ray PDFs of PT-BS does not significant change in unpoled and poled state due to coexistence of two phases in both states. The variations in the peaks at 3.5, which result from the closest Pb/Bi-(Ni, Hf, Ti) pairings, are clearly indicated by PT-BNH are a result of poling which is also evident from the peak height increase after poling. This behavior is defined as a considerable change in interatomic distance atoms at between B site and their surrounding Pb / Bi atoms, according to the PDF description. In the current research work, the comparative analysis of electromechanical performance of morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) based normal ferroelectric and non-MPB based relaxor ferroelectric perovskites is focused to reveal its hidden characteristics of electromechanical performances for getting the fruitful advantages in the various fields of applications. MPB has applications in many fields, including DRAM cell capacitance, technical constraints of DRAM, and stress engineering.

# CONCLUSION
From the above results and discussion, the following points can be drawn: \u2022 The large electromechanical response is observed in PbTiO3-BiScO3 (PT-BS) (d 33 \u223c500 pC/N) MPB and PbTiO3-Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 (PT-BNH) (d 33 \u223c425 pC/N) non-MPB systems, respectively. \u2022 Structural analysis of MPB (x = 0.3725) composition of PbTiO3-BiScO3 (PT-BS) shows tetragonal + rhombohedral / monoclinic phase co-existence with tetragonal phase. \u2022 On the other hand for (x = 0.39) composition of PbTiO3-Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 (PT-BNH) shows cubic like (CL) + tetragonal phase co-existence (non-MPB) and tetragonal phase. \u2022 Raman spectra and x-ray pair distribution analysis show that the cubic like phase is miniaturized domains with tetragonal symmetry and its correlation length increases upon poling. \u2022 Structural analysis of PT-BNH revealed that unpoled structure CL and tetragonal domain transform to tetragonal on poling. \u2022 Morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) compositions, by feature of inter-ferroelectric structural instability exhibit large electromechanical responses. \u2022 It can be clearly stabilized that inter ferroelectric instability is not solely responsible for superior piezoelectric response and structural heterogeneity can play a huge role in enhancing the piezoelectric properties. The large electromechanical response is observed in PbTiO3-BiScO3 (PT-BS) (d 33 \u223c500 pC/N) MPB and PbTiO3-Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 (PT-BNH) (d 33 \u223c425 pC/N) non-MPB systems, respectively. Structural analysis of MPB (x = 0.3725) composition of PbTiO3-BiScO3 (PT-BS) shows tetragonal + rhombohedral / monoclinic phase co-existence with tetragonal phase. On the other hand for (x = 0.39) composition of PbTiO3-Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 (PT-BNH) shows cubic like (CL) + tetragonal phase co-existence (non-MPB) and tetragonal phase. Structural analysis of PT-BNH revealed that unpoled structure CL and tetragonal domain transform to tetragonal on poling. Morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) compositions, by feature of inter-ferroelectric structural instability exhibit large electromechanical responses.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The gradual evolution of the pseudocubic {111}pc, {200}pc and {220}pc Bragg peaks profiles of (1-x)PbTiO3-(x)BiScO3 (0.36\u2264x \u22640.40) with composition (x) is shown in (a). The Bragg intensity of the rhombohedral / monoclinic phase is pronounced at x = 0.365. At x = 0.365, the rhombohedral / monoclinic phase's Bragg intensity is very strong, with increase in BiScO3 concentration (x), the height or intensity of the monoclinic peak steadily grows. For composition with x = 0.39, the monoclinic peaks dominate the pattern and the tetragonal peaks in the tail or background region are barely visible. Complete pattern fitting of XRD data was performed using the Rietveld method using a tetragonal (P4mm) + monoclinic (Cm) average structure. It should be observed that the compositions x = 0.40 and x = 0.36 appear to be pure rhombohedral / monoclinic and tetragonal phases, respectively, but the structural model fit was enhanced when the second sub phase or minor phase was included. Similarly, we have present Bragg peak profile of (1-x)PbTiO3-(x)Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 (0.35\u2264x\u22640.42) with composition (x) respectively in (b). The {111}pc profile remains singlet in all compositions and indicates the CL phase. Based on this visual examination of the Bragg profile, the overall pattern fit of the XRD data was performed using the Rietveld method with a tetragonal (P4mm) + cubic (Pm3\u0305m) average structure. It should be emphasized that the cubic (Pm3\u0305m) structure used here is for convenience only and does not represent the true structure, as will be disclosed in the following section. These two structural phase coexistence models of (P4mm) + cubic (Pm3\u0305m) fits the data very well. It can note that although the components x = 0.40, 0.42 and x = 0.35 appeared as pure and quaternary CL, respectively, the fit improved as the phase the second smallest is included in the structural model. (a) and 2 (d) shows the composition dependence lattice parameters of PT-BS and PT-BNH systems. As it can be seen clearly in (a), Lattice parameters \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 increases while \u2018c\u2019 decreases for monoclinic with increase in x (composition), similarly with increasing x, the tetragonal 'a' parameter grows, whereas the 'c' parameter decreases. While in (d) tetragonal \u2018a\u2019 parameter increases, and the \u2018c\u2019 parameter decreases with increasing x. This becomes more apparent with tetragonal (c / a) compositional changes ((b) and 2 (e)). SEM micrograph of PT-BS with x = 0.3725 and PT-BNH with x = 0.39 are shown in (a) and 3 (b) respectively. The average grain size was found to approximately (4\u20135 \xb5m) for these sample. Short correlation length is the indication of presence of nano polar region which is well known in the case of relaxor ferroelectric similar to PT-BNH system to show high piezoelectric property. Thus an optimum coherent length results in like high piezoelectricity. (c, f) depicts that variation of longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) of PT-BS and PT-BNH with composition. It is evident from (c, f) that d 33 drastically enhanced in the intermediate composition range decreasing on each side of the MPB, demarcating the MPB area. In the unpoled state of the PT-BNH for the x = 0.39 (large piezoelectric response) tetragonal and cubic similar phases coexist, similar to ordinary MPB systems of PT-BS, where the phase coexistence of tetragonal and rhombohedral/monoclinic regions, there is a strong piezoelectric response. Except for PT-BNZ and PT-BS , this d 33 value is comparable or higher than that of several other reported Bi/Pb-based MPB solid solutions such as 0.63Bi(Mg1/2Ti1/2)O3-0.37PbTiO3 , 0.51Bi(Ni1/2Ti1/2)O3-0.49PbTiO3 , 0.38Bi(Mg3/4W1/4)O3-0.62PbTiO3 , 0.35Bi(Ni2/3Nb1/3)O3-0.65PbTiO3. (a, c) shows the electric field driven phase transformations in PT-BS and PT-BNH. To study the effect of electric field in PT-BS and PT-BNH, pellets of various compositions of PT-BS and PT-BNH were poled at 40 kV/cm on silicon oil bath at room temperature. The poled pellets were crushed into fine powders and XRD pattern was recorded. We have observed from (a) {002}pc/{200}pc XRD profiles which appear to be triplet for the composition with x = 0.3725 in the unpoled state [ (left panel)] unpoled state does not fully transform into tetragonal phase with fraction of rhombohedral phase still persisting after applied electric field. Similarly, the {111}pc XRD peak remains doublet reveals the rhombohedral/monoclinic phase. For the MPB compositions with x = 0.365 \u2013 0.39, similar trend obtained for unpoled and poled samples. As can be seen from (c) that {002}pc/{200}pc XRD profiles which appear to be singlet for the composition with x = 0.40 in the unpoled state [ (right panel)] splitted into two peaks after applied electric field. The {111}pc XRD peak is remain singlet reveals the tetragonal structure for x = 0.40. For the MPB compositions with x = 0.36 \u2013 0.39, similar trend obtained for poled samples. Pseudocubic reflections {200}pc which have triplet nature (for x = 0.36\u20130.39) in unpoled state [ (right panel)] transform in tetragonal phase with doublet {002}pc/{200}pc reflections. (b) and 4 (d) shows the variation of tetragonality (c/a) of poled samples on application of electric field. The tetragonality of poled samples is higher than that of annealed samples of PT-BNH, while no significant changes in tetragonality is observed after poling in conventional PT-BS (MPB) systems. (a) and (b) shows the high temperature dielectric permittivity of PT-BS with x = 0.3725 and PT-BNH with x = 0.39 respectively. In relaxor ferroelectric PT-BNH dielectric permittivity continuously decreases with increasing the frequency. All these features indicate the relaxor nature of PT-BNH. Relaxors are characterized by the presence of local structural heterogeneities and their domains are in form of polar nano regions (PNRs). At very high temperature well above the TC, the PNR transform to the high symmetry cubic phase rendering the material paraelectric. On contrary PT-BS with x = 0.3725 shows conventional ferroelectric behavior where TC remains unchanged with frequency. The ferroelectric-paraelectric transition peak is sharper in comparison to PT-BNH x = 0.39 which has a diffused peak. Prior studies have reported similar characteristics for the (MPB) PT-BS with x = 0.3725 composition. We carried out high temperature XRD measurement on poled composition of PT-BNH with x = 0.39. For this, pellet was poled at 40 kV/cm on room temperature and crushed into fine powder. (a) - (d) displays the evolution of the pseudocubic {200}pc Bragg profile of poled (1-x)PT-(x)BNH (x = 0.39) with temperature, variation of lattice parameter, unit cell volume, and tetragonality (c/a) of poled (1-x)PT-(x)BNH (x = 0.39) with temperature, respectively. shows room temperature Raman spectra of representative compositions of (1-x)PT-(x)BS and (1-x)PT-(x)BNH specimens in their unpoled and poled states. Lorentzian fitting was carried out to the Raman data of the specimens after correcting the Bose-Einstein factor. (a) and (e) show the Lorentzian curve fitting of unpoled MPB PT-BS composition (x = 0.3725) and pseudo-MPB PT-BNH composition (x = 0.39), respectively. Following earlier literatures , the Raman spectra were fitted with nine different peaks (modes) \u2013 (1) E(TO1)\u223c65 cmE^{\u22121}, (2) E(LO1) \u223c76 cmE^{\u22121}, (3) A1(1TO) \u223c191 cmE^{\u22121}, (4) E(2TO) \u223c 272.2 cmE^{\u22121}, (5) (B1 + E) \u223c 330 cmE^{\u22121}, (6) A1(2TO) \u223c 387.6 cmE^{\u22121}, (7) E(3TO) \u223c 497.8 cmE^{\u22121}, (8) TO3(A1 +E) \u223c556 cmE^{\u22121}, and (9) A1(3TO) \u223c607 cmE^{\u22121} respectively. Peaks 1 and 2 (E (TO1) mode) arise due to the A-O vibrational mode (for perovskite with general formula ABO3). Peak 3 corresponds to the A-B site coupling, and peaks 4\u20136 are associated B-O vibrational mode. Peaks 7\u20139 arise from the oxygen translatory motion associated with the oxygen octahedral. For example, the A1(1TO) mode has been recorded at \u223c180 cmE^{\u22121} for 0.59PbTiO3-0.41Bi(Ni1/2Zr1/2)O3 , \u223c185 cmE^{\u22121} for 0.4PbTiO3-0.6BiFeO3 and at \u223c172 cmE^{\u22121} in 0.65PbTiO3-0.35 Bi(Zn1/2Ti1/2)O3 , and \u223c185 cmE^{\u22121} in 0.66PbTiO3-0.34 BiScO3. In the A-BO3 translational mode vibration, the A1(1TO) mode is related with off-center polar displacement of A-site cations (BiE^{3+/}PbE^{2+}) with respect to BO6 octahedra. Noticeable softening (\u0394\u03c9 = 10 cmE^{\u22121}) in the (B1 + E) mode (peak 5) is observed after poling in x = 0.3725 of PT-BS, (c). Mode softening in the Raman spectra indicates field induced local structural transformation in the MPB PT-BS composition which complies with the field induced structural transformation at a global length scale as per XRPD. No obvious mode softening is observed upon poling in x = 0.36 and x = 0.40 of PT-BS, (b) and 7 (d). Similarity in the profile of Raman spectra of PT-BNH compositions ((f) \u22127 (h)) in the unpoled state suggests invariant local structural symmetry across the compositions. Therefore, what globally appears as cubic like structure (XRPD pattern), is essentially has tetragonal symmetry with smaller co-relation length. In pure tetragonal PbTiO3 the A site is being occupied with Pb and B site with Ti as we \u0111ope BNH in the system, Bismuth competes with Pb on A sites and NH with Ti on B site. Though we see no additional Raman signature confirming no change in tetragonal structure but broadening of the Raman peaks can be seen as we increase the concentration of BNH in the system. This is expected as multiple ions on A and B sites compete and with vibrational frequency\u2019s very near to each other thus contributing to very close Raman peaks which is reflected as broadening. depicts the compares of the room-temperature PDFs of the poled and unpoled specimens of PT-BS with x = 0.3725 and PT-BNH with x = 0.39 samples extracted from the x-ray scattering data for the range of inter atomic distances (r). Therefore, we have observed in PT-BS and in PT-BNH alloys unpoled, the pair correlations from3.0 to 4.5 \xc5 [see (c, d)] mainly refer to the nearest-neighbor A/B-A/B correlations. The others peaks are assigned as \u223c3.38 \xc5 correspond to nearest-neighbor A-B pairs, while that at \u223c3.94 \xc5 by nearest-neighbor A-A and B-B pairs. However, a general observation is that the local structural features in unpoled and poled of PT-BS with x = 0.3725 [(c, e)] remain, at least visibly, very similar in terms of nearest-neighbor distances, while local structural observation of unpoled and poled of PT-BNH with x = 0.39 in (d, f) some visible changes in nearest neighbor distances. Therefore, we have extracted some first-hand quantitative information, the peaks from 3.0 to 4.5 \xc5 were fitted with two Gaussians (minimum number of peaks required to follow the feature) as shown in (d) for PT-BNH with x = 0.39. Compare unpoled (c) and poled (e) of PT-BS with x = 03725, which shows no significant change in FWHM and bond distances due in both samples shows coexistence of monoclinic and tetragonal phases, which is clearly seen in x-ray pattern [ left panel unpoled state and (a) poled state]. It is clear that from (d, e) clearly indicate that the changes in the peaks at \u223c3.5 \xc5, which arise from the nearest Pb/Bi-(Ni, Hf, Ti) pairs, exhibit obvious changes after poling. According to the definition of PDF, this behavior implies a significant bond length change between B-site atoms and their adjacent Pb/Bi atoms. Another observation is that the peak at \u223c4.02 \xc5 shows almost no shift after poling. The peak at \u223c4.02 \xc5 corresponds to the A-A/B-B atom pair\u2019s parallel to < 100 > direction, which is the polar axis of the tetragonal. In (d) unpoled and 8 (e) poled of PT-BNH with x = 0.39, the widening of the distribution of displacements for the A-site cations in unpoled state as compare to poled state have significant and steady decrease in the FWHM of first peak.

# TITLE
Comparative analysis of electromechanical performance of morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) based normal ferroelectric and non-MPB based relaxor ferroelectric perovskites

# ABSTRACT
In the present work, we demonstrate that one can obtain comparable properties in composition far from Morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) by tuning the correlation length of polar-structural ordering in single phase relaxor ferroelectric perovskite. We examined this idea by a comparative structure-property analysis of a ferroelectric system (1-x) PbTiO3-(x)BiScO3 (PT-BS) (d33 â¼500 pC/N at MPB) and a non-MPB (1-x)PbTiO3-(x)Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 (PT-BNH) system (d33 â¼425 pC/N at pseudo-MPB). Structural analysis of x-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) data of MPB (xâ¯=â¯0.3725) composition of (1-x) PbTiO3-(x)BiScO3 (PT-BS) shows tetragonal +â¯rhombohedral/monoclinic phase co-existence and there is a increment in tetragonal structural phase fraction at the cost of rhombohedral phase after poling, resulting in large piezoelectric property. On the other hand XRPD data of pseudo-MPB (xâ¯=â¯0.39) composition of (1-x)PbTiO3-(x)Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 (PT-BNH) shows cubic like (CL) +â¯tetragonal phase co-existence and tetragonal structural phase fraction increases at the cost of co-existing cubic like phase upon poling, giving rise to the piezoelectric property comparable to that of MPB PT-BS. Our analysis suggests that increased polar-structure heterogeneity at the non-MPB composition can result in large piezoelectric response and requirement of a MPB composition is not a necessary criterion to obtain enhanced electromechanical property.

# INTRODUCTION
Lead Zirconium Titanate (PZT) based ferroelectric and piezoelectric alloys are one of the most coveted materials for actuator, pressure sensors, memory devices, transducers and communication wide range applications. While this has propelled to the study and discovery of new lead-free alloys which are mainly classified into BaTiO3-based , BiFeO3-based , Na1/2Bi1/2TiO3-based and K1/2Na1/2NbO3-based systems, drawbacks such as low Curie point (BaTiO3-based systems), issue of property reproducibility owing to the equal probability of formation of FeE^{2 +} and FeE^{3+} (BiFeO3\u2013based system) low longitudinal piezoelectric responses (Na1/2Bi1/2TiO3-based systems), and the difficulty in replicating the appropriate structural phases and property because of the high susceptibility to even minute alteration in synthesis condition [(K, Na)NbO3 (KNN)-based systems], are serious obstructions which are hampering the commercial use and acceptance of these Pb free piezoelectric ceramics. In addition, as a result of the oblique polymorphic phase boundaries / morphotropic phase boundaries (PPB/MPB) of these systems, temperature sensitivity to electromechanical and piezoelectric characteristics is significant, which is undesirable from a device perspective. This has led researchers to focus on Bi/Pb-based piezoelectric systems and new MPB based piezoelectric ceramics. MPB compositions, by virtue of inter-ferroelectric structural instability exhibit large electromechanical responses. Many types of Bi/Pb-based MPB perovskite have been previously investigated, some of which even show a higher Curie temperature (TC) than PZT, this is very useful for application at elevated or high temperature. After, the perusal of literature for the high TC piezoelectric ceramics, A solid solution of of (1-x)BiScO3\u2013xPbTiO3 (BS\u2013PT) was studied. It has a transition temperature (TC \u223c 460E^{\u1d52}C) higher than that of PZT (\u223c 400E^{\u1d52}C) and shows an incredible piezoelectric response near MPB at x \u223c 0.64. Several other Bi/Pb-based solid solutions such as (1-x)Bi(Ni1/2Ti1/2)O3\u2013xPbTiO3 , (1-x)Bi(Ni1/2Zr1/2)O3\u2013xPbTiO3 , (1-x)Bi(Zn1/2Ti1/2)O3\u2013xPbTiO3 , (1-x)Bi(Mg1/2Ti1/2)O3\u2013xPbTiO3 , (Bi1/2Na1/2)TiO3\u2013BaTiO3\u2013(Bi1/2K1/2)TiO3 , (1-x)Bi(Mg1/2Zr1/2)O3\u2013xPbTiO3 , (1-x)Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3\u2013xPbTiO3 have been explored; Some of Bi/Pb-based alloys exhibit good piezoelectric response. For achieving a good piezoelectric response apart from an optimized tetragonality, the solid solubility range should be such that the system settles in a coexistence of ferroelectric phases resulting in formation of morphotropic phase boundary (MPB). Some prominent Bi/Pb based solid solution systems showing a high electromechanical (d 33) response are PbTiO3-BiScO3 (PT-BS) (d 33\u223c450 pC/N) and (1-x)Bi(Ni1/2Zr1/2)O3-xPbTiO3 ((1-x)BNZ-xPT) (d 33\u223c400 pC/N). Recently, a new alloy system in this category namely PbTiO3-Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 has reported with exceptional piezoelectric properties (d 33 \u223c446 pC/N). Based on structure, there is a significant difference between the Bi/Pb-based MPBs and conventional Pb-based MPBs. Traditional Pb-based MPB systems such as PZT and PMNPT show the coexistence of ferroelectric and tetragonal and rhombohedral / monoclinic phases. In contrast, the coexisting phases in Bi/Pb-based (except BS-PT) systems are mostly reported as tetragonal and \u201ccubic-like\u201d. Pandey et al. reported these types of binary system (alloys) which can be termed as non-conventional MPB systems. In recent times, some research groups have argued that structural mechanism is most probably to be prepotent phenomenon or mechanism associated with the enhanced piezoelectric response in conventional MPB systems. The non-conventional MPB compositions of Bi/Pb-based (except BS-PT) have not received such a detailed investigation of the mechanisms associated with those large piezoelectric responses. The clarity regarding the structural state is the first and foremost requirement for gaining better insight about the possible mechanism(s) in these non-conventional MPB systems. Building on this, it is decided to perform a comprehensive comparison of the crystal structure and piezoelectric response of PT-BS (MPB) and PT-BNH (non-MPB) solid solution. It is found that the piezoelectric response (d 33) in PT-BS in MPB region is very similar to that in PT-BNH (non-MPB) region i.e in excess of \u223c400 pC/N. This would allow a meaningful comparison of the properties and the mechanisms between PT-BS and PT-BNH and help understand the mechanisms better through examination of the similarities/differences pertaining to the structural mechanisms in the two systems. Using complementary experimental approaches such as electric-field and temperature dependent x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, dielectric, piezoelectric measurements, and x-ray PDF for a thorough examination and analysis. It is observed that the entire MPB region of the PT-BS composition has coexistence of low symmetry tetragonal and monoclinic phases, while structure of PT-BNH has coexistence of low symmetry tetragonal and high symmetry cubic phases at room temperature. In PT-BS, unpoled state does not fully transform into tetragonal phase with fraction of rhombohedral phase persisting after applied electric field, while in PT-BNH cubic like phase fully transform into tetragonal phase in the global scale after application of electric field. Interestingly, the Raman spectra, which probes the structural state on local scale, shows some differences in the unpoled and poled spectrum in PT-BS MPB systems while, no distinction is seen between unpoled and poled Raman spectrum in PT-BNH systems, thereby suggesting that on a small length scale the structure is still tetragonal, which appears to be a cubic-like phase globally. The study reveals the fundamental contrast between the conventional MPB and non-conventional MPB piezoelectric by showing that the appearance of coexistence of two phases on the global scale in our non-conventional MPB system is due to coexistence of short range and long ranged tetragonal domains. We also show that the x-ray PDFs of PT-BS does not significant change in unpoled and poled state due to coexistence of two phases in both states. The variations in the peaks at 3.5, which result from the closest Pb/Bi-(Ni, Hf, Ti) pairings, are clearly indicated by PT-BNH are a result of poling which is also evident from the peak height increase after poling. This behavior is defined as a considerable change in interatomic distance atoms at between B site and their surrounding Pb / Bi atoms, according to the PDF description. In the current research work, the comparative analysis of electromechanical performance of morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) based normal ferroelectric and non-MPB based relaxor ferroelectric perovskites is focused to reveal its hidden characteristics of electromechanical performances for getting the fruitful advantages in the various fields of applications. MPB has applications in many fields, including DRAM cell capacitance, technical constraints of DRAM, and stress engineering.

# CONCLUSION
From the above results and discussion, the following points can be drawn: \u2022 The large electromechanical response is observed in PbTiO3-BiScO3 (PT-BS) (d 33 \u223c500 pC/N) MPB and PbTiO3-Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 (PT-BNH) (d 33 \u223c425 pC/N) non-MPB systems, respectively. \u2022 Structural analysis of MPB (x = 0.3725) composition of PbTiO3-BiScO3 (PT-BS) shows tetragonal + rhombohedral / monoclinic phase co-existence with tetragonal phase. \u2022 On the other hand for (x = 0.39) composition of PbTiO3-Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 (PT-BNH) shows cubic like (CL) + tetragonal phase co-existence (non-MPB) and tetragonal phase. \u2022 Raman spectra and x-ray pair distribution analysis show that the cubic like phase is miniaturized domains with tetragonal symmetry and its correlation length increases upon poling. \u2022 Structural analysis of PT-BNH revealed that unpoled structure CL and tetragonal domain transform to tetragonal on poling. \u2022 Morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) compositions, by feature of inter-ferroelectric structural instability exhibit large electromechanical responses. \u2022 It can be clearly stabilized that inter ferroelectric instability is not solely responsible for superior piezoelectric response and structural heterogeneity can play a huge role in enhancing the piezoelectric properties. The large electromechanical response is observed in PbTiO3-BiScO3 (PT-BS) (d 33 \u223c500 pC/N) MPB and PbTiO3-Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 (PT-BNH) (d 33 \u223c425 pC/N) non-MPB systems, respectively. Structural analysis of MPB (x = 0.3725) composition of PbTiO3-BiScO3 (PT-BS) shows tetragonal + rhombohedral / monoclinic phase co-existence with tetragonal phase. On the other hand for (x = 0.39) composition of PbTiO3-Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 (PT-BNH) shows cubic like (CL) + tetragonal phase co-existence (non-MPB) and tetragonal phase. Structural analysis of PT-BNH revealed that unpoled structure CL and tetragonal domain transform to tetragonal on poling. Morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) compositions, by feature of inter-ferroelectric structural instability exhibit large electromechanical responses.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The gradual evolution of the pseudocubic {111}pc, {200}pc and {220}pc Bragg peaks profiles of (1-x)PbTiO3-(x)BiScO3 (0.36\u2264x \u22640.40) with composition (x) is shown in (a). The Bragg intensity of the rhombohedral / monoclinic phase is pronounced at x = 0.365. At x = 0.365, the rhombohedral / monoclinic phase's Bragg intensity is very strong, with increase in BiScO3 concentration (x), the height or intensity of the monoclinic peak steadily grows. For composition with x = 0.39, the monoclinic peaks dominate the pattern and the tetragonal peaks in the tail or background region are barely visible. Complete pattern fitting of XRD data was performed using the Rietveld method using a tetragonal (P4mm) + monoclinic (Cm) average structure. It should be observed that the compositions x = 0.40 and x = 0.36 appear to be pure rhombohedral / monoclinic and tetragonal phases, respectively, but the structural model fit was enhanced when the second sub phase or minor phase was included. Similarly, we have present Bragg peak profile of (1-x)PbTiO3-(x)Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 (0.35\u2264x\u22640.42) with composition (x) respectively in (b). The {111}pc profile remains singlet in all compositions and indicates the CL phase. Based on this visual examination of the Bragg profile, the overall pattern fit of the XRD data was performed using the Rietveld method with a tetragonal (P4mm) + cubic (Pm3\u0305m) average structure. It should be emphasized that the cubic (Pm3\u0305m) structure used here is for convenience only and does not represent the true structure, as will be disclosed in the following section. These two structural phase coexistence models of (P4mm) + cubic (Pm3\u0305m) fits the data very well. It can note that although the components x = 0.40, 0.42 and x = 0.35 appeared as pure and quaternary CL, respectively, the fit improved as the phase the second smallest is included in the structural model. (a) and 2 (d) shows the composition dependence lattice parameters of PT-BS and PT-BNH systems. As it can be seen clearly in (a), Lattice parameters \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 increases while \u2018c\u2019 decreases for monoclinic with increase in x (composition), similarly with increasing x, the tetragonal 'a' parameter grows, whereas the 'c' parameter decreases. While in (d) tetragonal \u2018a\u2019 parameter increases, and the \u2018c\u2019 parameter decreases with increasing x. This becomes more apparent with tetragonal (c / a) compositional changes ((b) and 2 (e)). SEM micrograph of PT-BS with x = 0.3725 and PT-BNH with x = 0.39 are shown in (a) and 3 (b) respectively. The average grain size was found to approximately (4\u20135 \xb5m) for these sample. Short correlation length is the indication of presence of nano polar region which is well known in the case of relaxor ferroelectric similar to PT-BNH system to show high piezoelectric property. Thus an optimum coherent length results in like high piezoelectricity. (c, f) depicts that variation of longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) of PT-BS and PT-BNH with composition. It is evident from (c, f) that d 33 drastically enhanced in the intermediate composition range decreasing on each side of the MPB, demarcating the MPB area. In the unpoled state of the PT-BNH for the x = 0.39 (large piezoelectric response) tetragonal and cubic similar phases coexist, similar to ordinary MPB systems of PT-BS, where the phase coexistence of tetragonal and rhombohedral/monoclinic regions, there is a strong piezoelectric response. Except for PT-BNZ and PT-BS , this d 33 value is comparable or higher than that of several other reported Bi/Pb-based MPB solid solutions such as 0.63Bi(Mg1/2Ti1/2)O3-0.37PbTiO3 , 0.51Bi(Ni1/2Ti1/2)O3-0.49PbTiO3 , 0.38Bi(Mg3/4W1/4)O3-0.62PbTiO3 , 0.35Bi(Ni2/3Nb1/3)O3-0.65PbTiO3. (a, c) shows the electric field driven phase transformations in PT-BS and PT-BNH. To study the effect of electric field in PT-BS and PT-BNH, pellets of various compositions of PT-BS and PT-BNH were poled at 40 kV/cm on silicon oil bath at room temperature. The poled pellets were crushed into fine powders and XRD pattern was recorded. We have observed from (a) {002}pc/{200}pc XRD profiles which appear to be triplet for the composition with x = 0.3725 in the unpoled state [ (left panel)] unpoled state does not fully transform into tetragonal phase with fraction of rhombohedral phase still persisting after applied electric field. Similarly, the {111}pc XRD peak remains doublet reveals the rhombohedral/monoclinic phase. For the MPB compositions with x = 0.365 \u2013 0.39, similar trend obtained for unpoled and poled samples. As can be seen from (c) that {002}pc/{200}pc XRD profiles which appear to be singlet for the composition with x = 0.40 in the unpoled state [ (right panel)] splitted into two peaks after applied electric field. The {111}pc XRD peak is remain singlet reveals the tetragonal structure for x = 0.40. For the MPB compositions with x = 0.36 \u2013 0.39, similar trend obtained for poled samples. Pseudocubic reflections {200}pc which have triplet nature (for x = 0.36\u20130.39) in unpoled state [ (right panel)] transform in tetragonal phase with doublet {002}pc/{200}pc reflections. (b) and 4 (d) shows the variation of tetragonality (c/a) of poled samples on application of electric field. The tetragonality of poled samples is higher than that of annealed samples of PT-BNH, while no significant changes in tetragonality is observed after poling in conventional PT-BS (MPB) systems. (a) and (b) shows the high temperature dielectric permittivity of PT-BS with x = 0.3725 and PT-BNH with x = 0.39 respectively. In relaxor ferroelectric PT-BNH dielectric permittivity continuously decreases with increasing the frequency. All these features indicate the relaxor nature of PT-BNH. Relaxors are characterized by the presence of local structural heterogeneities and their domains are in form of polar nano regions (PNRs). At very high temperature well above the TC, the PNR transform to the high symmetry cubic phase rendering the material paraelectric. On contrary PT-BS with x = 0.3725 shows conventional ferroelectric behavior where TC remains unchanged with frequency. The ferroelectric-paraelectric transition peak is sharper in comparison to PT-BNH x = 0.39 which has a diffused peak. Prior studies have reported similar characteristics for the (MPB) PT-BS with x = 0.3725 composition. We carried out high temperature XRD measurement on poled composition of PT-BNH with x = 0.39. For this, pellet was poled at 40 kV/cm on room temperature and crushed into fine powder. (a) - (d) displays the evolution of the pseudocubic {200}pc Bragg profile of poled (1-x)PT-(x)BNH (x = 0.39) with temperature, variation of lattice parameter, unit cell volume, and tetragonality (c/a) of poled (1-x)PT-(x)BNH (x = 0.39) with temperature, respectively. shows room temperature Raman spectra of representative compositions of (1-x)PT-(x)BS and (1-x)PT-(x)BNH specimens in their unpoled and poled states. Lorentzian fitting was carried out to the Raman data of the specimens after correcting the Bose-Einstein factor. (a) and (e) show the Lorentzian curve fitting of unpoled MPB PT-BS composition (x = 0.3725) and pseudo-MPB PT-BNH composition (x = 0.39), respectively. Following earlier literatures , the Raman spectra were fitted with nine different peaks (modes) \u2013 (1) E(TO1)\u223c65 cmE^{\u22121}, (2) E(LO1) \u223c76 cmE^{\u22121}, (3) A1(1TO) \u223c191 cmE^{\u22121}, (4) E(2TO) \u223c 272.2 cmE^{\u22121}, (5) (B1 + E) \u223c 330 cmE^{\u22121}, (6) A1(2TO) \u223c 387.6 cmE^{\u22121}, (7) E(3TO) \u223c 497.8 cmE^{\u22121}, (8) TO3(A1 +E) \u223c556 cmE^{\u22121}, and (9) A1(3TO) \u223c607 cmE^{\u22121} respectively. Peaks 1 and 2 (E (TO1) mode) arise due to the A-O vibrational mode (for perovskite with general formula ABO3). Peak 3 corresponds to the A-B site coupling, and peaks 4\u20136 are associated B-O vibrational mode. Peaks 7\u20139 arise from the oxygen translatory motion associated with the oxygen octahedral. For example, the A1(1TO) mode has been recorded at \u223c180 cmE^{\u22121} for 0.59PbTiO3-0.41Bi(Ni1/2Zr1/2)O3 , \u223c185 cmE^{\u22121} for 0.4PbTiO3-0.6BiFeO3 and at \u223c172 cmE^{\u22121} in 0.65PbTiO3-0.35 Bi(Zn1/2Ti1/2)O3 , and \u223c185 cmE^{\u22121} in 0.66PbTiO3-0.34 BiScO3. In the A-BO3 translational mode vibration, the A1(1TO) mode is related with off-center polar displacement of A-site cations (BiE^{3+/}PbE^{2+}) with respect to BO6 octahedra. Noticeable softening (\u0394\u03c9 = 10 cmE^{\u22121}) in the (B1 + E) mode (peak 5) is observed after poling in x = 0.3725 of PT-BS, (c). Mode softening in the Raman spectra indicates field induced local structural transformation in the MPB PT-BS composition which complies with the field induced structural transformation at a global length scale as per XRPD. No obvious mode softening is observed upon poling in x = 0.36 and x = 0.40 of PT-BS, (b) and 7 (d). Similarity in the profile of Raman spectra of PT-BNH compositions ((f) \u22127 (h)) in the unpoled state suggests invariant local structural symmetry across the compositions. Therefore, what globally appears as cubic like structure (XRPD pattern), is essentially has tetragonal symmetry with smaller co-relation length. In pure tetragonal PbTiO3 the A site is being occupied with Pb and B site with Ti as we \u0111ope BNH in the system, Bismuth competes with Pb on A sites and NH with Ti on B site. Though we see no additional Raman signature confirming no change in tetragonal structure but broadening of the Raman peaks can be seen as we increase the concentration of BNH in the system. This is expected as multiple ions on A and B sites compete and with vibrational frequency\u2019s very near to each other thus contributing to very close Raman peaks which is reflected as broadening. depicts the compares of the room-temperature PDFs of the poled and unpoled specimens of PT-BS with x = 0.3725 and PT-BNH with x = 0.39 samples extracted from the x-ray scattering data for the range of inter atomic distances (r). Therefore, we have observed in PT-BS and in PT-BNH alloys unpoled, the pair correlations from3.0 to 4.5 \xc5 [see (c, d)] mainly refer to the nearest-neighbor A/B-A/B correlations. The others peaks are assigned as \u223c3.38 \xc5 correspond to nearest-neighbor A-B pairs, while that at \u223c3.94 \xc5 by nearest-neighbor A-A and B-B pairs. However, a general observation is that the local structural features in unpoled and poled of PT-BS with x = 0.3725 [(c, e)] remain, at least visibly, very similar in terms of nearest-neighbor distances, while local structural observation of unpoled and poled of PT-BNH with x = 0.39 in (d, f) some visible changes in nearest neighbor distances. Therefore, we have extracted some first-hand quantitative information, the peaks from 3.0 to 4.5 \xc5 were fitted with two Gaussians (minimum number of peaks required to follow the feature) as shown in (d) for PT-BNH with x = 0.39. Compare unpoled (c) and poled (e) of PT-BS with x = 03725, which shows no significant change in FWHM and bond distances due in both samples shows coexistence of monoclinic and tetragonal phases, which is clearly seen in x-ray pattern [ left panel unpoled state and (a) poled state]. It is clear that from (d, e) clearly indicate that the changes in the peaks at \u223c3.5 \xc5, which arise from the nearest Pb/Bi-(Ni, Hf, Ti) pairs, exhibit obvious changes after poling. According to the definition of PDF, this behavior implies a significant bond length change between B-site atoms and their adjacent Pb/Bi atoms. Another observation is that the peak at \u223c4.02 \xc5 shows almost no shift after poling. The peak at \u223c4.02 \xc5 corresponds to the A-A/B-B atom pair\u2019s parallel to < 100 > direction, which is the polar axis of the tetragonal. In (d) unpoled and 8 (e) poled of PT-BNH with x = 0.39, the widening of the distribution of displacements for the A-site cations in unpoled state as compare to poled state have significant and steady decrease in the FWHM of first peak.

# TITLE
Comparative analysis of electromechanical performance of morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) based normal ferroelectric and non-MPB based relaxor ferroelectric perovskites

# ABSTRACT
In the present work, we demonstrate that one can obtain comparable properties in composition far from Morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) by tuning the correlation length of polar-structural ordering in single phase relaxor ferroelectric perovskite. We examined this idea by a comparative structure-property analysis of a ferroelectric system (1-x) PbTiO3-(x)BiScO3 (PT-BS) (d33 â¼500 pC/N at MPB) and a non-MPB (1-x)PbTiO3-(x)Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 (PT-BNH) system (d33 â¼425 pC/N at pseudo-MPB). Structural analysis of x-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) data of MPB (xâ¯=â¯0.3725) composition of (1-x) PbTiO3-(x)BiScO3 (PT-BS) shows tetragonal +â¯rhombohedral/monoclinic phase co-existence and there is a increment in tetragonal structural phase fraction at the cost of rhombohedral phase after poling, resulting in large piezoelectric property. On the other hand XRPD data of pseudo-MPB (xâ¯=â¯0.39) composition of (1-x)PbTiO3-(x)Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 (PT-BNH) shows cubic like (CL) +â¯tetragonal phase co-existence and tetragonal structural phase fraction increases at the cost of co-existing cubic like phase upon poling, giving rise to the piezoelectric property comparable to that of MPB PT-BS. Our analysis suggests that increased polar-structure heterogeneity at the non-MPB composition can result in large piezoelectric response and requirement of a MPB composition is not a necessary criterion to obtain enhanced electromechanical property.

# INTRODUCTION
Lead Zirconium Titanate (PZT) based ferroelectric and piezoelectric alloys are one of the most coveted materials for actuator, pressure sensors, memory devices, transducers and communication wide range applications. While this has propelled to the study and discovery of new lead-free alloys which are mainly classified into BaTiO3-based , BiFeO3-based , Na1/2Bi1/2TiO3-based and K1/2Na1/2NbO3-based systems, drawbacks such as low Curie point (BaTiO3-based systems), issue of property reproducibility owing to the equal probability of formation of FeE^{2 +} and FeE^{3+} (BiFeO3\u2013based system) low longitudinal piezoelectric responses (Na1/2Bi1/2TiO3-based systems), and the difficulty in replicating the appropriate structural phases and property because of the high susceptibility to even minute alteration in synthesis condition [(K, Na)NbO3 (KNN)-based systems], are serious obstructions which are hampering the commercial use and acceptance of these Pb free piezoelectric ceramics. In addition, as a result of the oblique polymorphic phase boundaries / morphotropic phase boundaries (PPB/MPB) of these systems, temperature sensitivity to electromechanical and piezoelectric characteristics is significant, which is undesirable from a device perspective. This has led researchers to focus on Bi/Pb-based piezoelectric systems and new MPB based piezoelectric ceramics. MPB compositions, by virtue of inter-ferroelectric structural instability exhibit large electromechanical responses. Many types of Bi/Pb-based MPB perovskite have been previously investigated, some of which even show a higher Curie temperature (TC) than PZT, this is very useful for application at elevated or high temperature. After, the perusal of literature for the high TC piezoelectric ceramics, A solid solution of of (1-x)BiScO3\u2013xPbTiO3 (BS\u2013PT) was studied. It has a transition temperature (TC \u223c 460E^{\u1d52}C) higher than that of PZT (\u223c 400E^{\u1d52}C) and shows an incredible piezoelectric response near MPB at x \u223c 0.64. Several other Bi/Pb-based solid solutions such as (1-x)Bi(Ni1/2Ti1/2)O3\u2013xPbTiO3 , (1-x)Bi(Ni1/2Zr1/2)O3\u2013xPbTiO3 , (1-x)Bi(Zn1/2Ti1/2)O3\u2013xPbTiO3 , (1-x)Bi(Mg1/2Ti1/2)O3\u2013xPbTiO3 , (Bi1/2Na1/2)TiO3\u2013BaTiO3\u2013(Bi1/2K1/2)TiO3 , (1-x)Bi(Mg1/2Zr1/2)O3\u2013xPbTiO3 , (1-x)Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3\u2013xPbTiO3 have been explored; Some of Bi/Pb-based alloys exhibit good piezoelectric response. For achieving a good piezoelectric response apart from an optimized tetragonality, the solid solubility range should be such that the system settles in a coexistence of ferroelectric phases resulting in formation of morphotropic phase boundary (MPB). Some prominent Bi/Pb based solid solution systems showing a high electromechanical (d 33) response are PbTiO3-BiScO3 (PT-BS) (d 33\u223c450 pC/N) and (1-x)Bi(Ni1/2Zr1/2)O3-xPbTiO3 ((1-x)BNZ-xPT) (d 33\u223c400 pC/N). Recently, a new alloy system in this category namely PbTiO3-Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 has reported with exceptional piezoelectric properties (d 33 \u223c446 pC/N). Based on structure, there is a significant difference between the Bi/Pb-based MPBs and conventional Pb-based MPBs. Traditional Pb-based MPB systems such as PZT and PMNPT show the coexistence of ferroelectric and tetragonal and rhombohedral / monoclinic phases. In contrast, the coexisting phases in Bi/Pb-based (except BS-PT) systems are mostly reported as tetragonal and \u201ccubic-like\u201d. Pandey et al. reported these types of binary system (alloys) which can be termed as non-conventional MPB systems. In recent times, some research groups have argued that structural mechanism is most probably to be prepotent phenomenon or mechanism associated with the enhanced piezoelectric response in conventional MPB systems. The non-conventional MPB compositions of Bi/Pb-based (except BS-PT) have not received such a detailed investigation of the mechanisms associated with those large piezoelectric responses. The clarity regarding the structural state is the first and foremost requirement for gaining better insight about the possible mechanism(s) in these non-conventional MPB systems. Building on this, it is decided to perform a comprehensive comparison of the crystal structure and piezoelectric response of PT-BS (MPB) and PT-BNH (non-MPB) solid solution. It is found that the piezoelectric response (d 33) in PT-BS in MPB region is very similar to that in PT-BNH (non-MPB) region i.e in excess of \u223c400 pC/N. This would allow a meaningful comparison of the properties and the mechanisms between PT-BS and PT-BNH and help understand the mechanisms better through examination of the similarities/differences pertaining to the structural mechanisms in the two systems. Using complementary experimental approaches such as electric-field and temperature dependent x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, dielectric, piezoelectric measurements, and x-ray PDF for a thorough examination and analysis. It is observed that the entire MPB region of the PT-BS composition has coexistence of low symmetry tetragonal and monoclinic phases, while structure of PT-BNH has coexistence of low symmetry tetragonal and high symmetry cubic phases at room temperature. In PT-BS, unpoled state does not fully transform into tetragonal phase with fraction of rhombohedral phase persisting after applied electric field, while in PT-BNH cubic like phase fully transform into tetragonal phase in the global scale after application of electric field. Interestingly, the Raman spectra, which probes the structural state on local scale, shows some differences in the unpoled and poled spectrum in PT-BS MPB systems while, no distinction is seen between unpoled and poled Raman spectrum in PT-BNH systems, thereby suggesting that on a small length scale the structure is still tetragonal, which appears to be a cubic-like phase globally. The study reveals the fundamental contrast between the conventional MPB and non-conventional MPB piezoelectric by showing that the appearance of coexistence of two phases on the global scale in our non-conventional MPB system is due to coexistence of short range and long ranged tetragonal domains. We also show that the x-ray PDFs of PT-BS does not significant change in unpoled and poled state due to coexistence of two phases in both states. The variations in the peaks at 3.5, which result from the closest Pb/Bi-(Ni, Hf, Ti) pairings, are clearly indicated by PT-BNH are a result of poling which is also evident from the peak height increase after poling. This behavior is defined as a considerable change in interatomic distance atoms at between B site and their surrounding Pb / Bi atoms, according to the PDF description. In the current research work, the comparative analysis of electromechanical performance of morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) based normal ferroelectric and non-MPB based relaxor ferroelectric perovskites is focused to reveal its hidden characteristics of electromechanical performances for getting the fruitful advantages in the various fields of applications. MPB has applications in many fields, including DRAM cell capacitance, technical constraints of DRAM, and stress engineering.

# CONCLUSION
From the above results and discussion, the following points can be drawn: \u2022 The large electromechanical response is observed in PbTiO3-BiScO3 (PT-BS) (d 33 \u223c500 pC/N) MPB and PbTiO3-Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 (PT-BNH) (d 33 \u223c425 pC/N) non-MPB systems, respectively. \u2022 Structural analysis of MPB (x = 0.3725) composition of PbTiO3-BiScO3 (PT-BS) shows tetragonal + rhombohedral / monoclinic phase co-existence with tetragonal phase. \u2022 On the other hand for (x = 0.39) composition of PbTiO3-Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 (PT-BNH) shows cubic like (CL) + tetragonal phase co-existence (non-MPB) and tetragonal phase. \u2022 Raman spectra and x-ray pair distribution analysis show that the cubic like phase is miniaturized domains with tetragonal symmetry and its correlation length increases upon poling. \u2022 Structural analysis of PT-BNH revealed that unpoled structure CL and tetragonal domain transform to tetragonal on poling. \u2022 Morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) compositions, by feature of inter-ferroelectric structural instability exhibit large electromechanical responses. \u2022 It can be clearly stabilized that inter ferroelectric instability is not solely responsible for superior piezoelectric response and structural heterogeneity can play a huge role in enhancing the piezoelectric properties. The large electromechanical response is observed in PbTiO3-BiScO3 (PT-BS) (d 33 \u223c500 pC/N) MPB and PbTiO3-Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 (PT-BNH) (d 33 \u223c425 pC/N) non-MPB systems, respectively. Structural analysis of MPB (x = 0.3725) composition of PbTiO3-BiScO3 (PT-BS) shows tetragonal + rhombohedral / monoclinic phase co-existence with tetragonal phase. On the other hand for (x = 0.39) composition of PbTiO3-Bi(Ni1/2Hf1/2)O3 (PT-BNH) shows cubic like (CL) + tetragonal phase co-existence (non-MPB) and tetragonal phase. Structural analysis of PT-BNH revealed that unpoled structure CL and tetragonal domain transform to tetragonal on poling. Morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) compositions, by feature of inter-ferroelectric structural instability exhibit large electromechanical responses.
