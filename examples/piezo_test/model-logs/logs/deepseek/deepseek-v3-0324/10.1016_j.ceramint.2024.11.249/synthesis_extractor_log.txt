High-purity (99.99 %) Bi2O3 and TiO2 oxide powders (Sigma-Aldrich) were used, with particle sizes ranging from submicron to ten microns. The powders were milled using an agate mortar and pestle to prevent agglomeration and ensure homogeneity, then dried at 150 \xb0C to remove moisture. Graphite powder (>45 \u03bcm, 99.99 % purity) and chemicals including sulfuric acid (H2SO4), potassium permanganate (KMnO4), sodium nitrate (NaNO3), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydrochloric acid (HCl), sodium dithionite (Na2S2O4), and hydrazine hydrate (N2H4) were also sourced from Sigma-Aldrich. In this study, we used Bi4Ti3O12 as the piezoelectric ceramic component. In our previous work , the Bismuth titanate (Bi4Ti3O12) was successfully synthesized. The synthesis was achieved through a solid-state reaction technique ( ), and the material was characterized using various methods, including XRD, Raman spectroscopy, TG/DTG, SEM/EDX. To ensure consistent high purity and a degree of deacetylation of 77 %, we opted for a custom extraction of chitosan. These factors are critical for enhancing the mechanical and functional properties of the BiTO/Chitosan/Graphene composite. The chitosan extraction process begins with by treating shrimp shells in a 10 % w/v sodium hydroxide solution to remove proteins, followed by hydrochloric acid treatment to remove calcium and obtain chitin. Washing and drying produce white chitin flakes, which are then deacetylated in an autoclave with a 45 % w/v sodium hydroxide solution, yielding chitosan flakes comprising 85 % of the total weight. Purification involves dissolving chitosan flakes in a 2 % acetic acid solution, neutralizing with 1N NaOH to pH 8, washing, and drying, resulting in pure chitosan stored for use. Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized using a modified Hummers' method. Initially, 1 g of graphite powder, 1 g of NaNO3, and 30 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) were mixed and stirred at 100 rpm for 30 min in an ice bath. Gradually, 3 g of KMnO4 were added while maintaining the temperature below 12 \xb0C. The mixture was then heated to 40 \xb0C and stirred for 2 h. Afterward, 50 ml of distilled water was added and the suspension was stirred at 98 \xb0C for 40 min. Finally, 16 ml of H2O2 (50 %) was added, followed by dilution with 260 ml of distilled water. The mixture was purified by centrifugation, washed with a 5 % aqueous HCl solution and distilled water until the pH was neutral, and then dried under vacuum at 60 \xb0C. Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was synthesized by exfoliating graphene oxide (GO) and then chemically reducing it with hydrazine. First, 50 mg of GO was dispersed in 50 mL of deionized water (1 mg/mL) and sonicated for 1 h. Then, 5 mL of hydrazine (N2H4) was added to the suspension, which was heated under reflux at 100 \xb0C for 12 h. The resulting graphite-colored product was cooled, filtered, washed with deionized water, and dried under vacuum at 60 \xb0C. A comprehensive series of xBiTO/(1 \u2212 x)Chitosan composites doped graphene, with 0\u20133 connectivity was prepared according to the full factorial design (x: ceramic weight %). The nanocomposites were elaborated according to the following steps: First, a (z wt.%) of graphene powder was added into the acetic acid solution (1 vol%) through ultrasonication for 1 h to obtain a uniform dispersed graphene solution. Then, the appropriate amount of Chitosan powder (1 wt% of the acetic acid solution) was added into the graphene/acetic acid solution and the mixture was stirred for 6 h at a room temperature, guaranteeing a total dissolution of the chitosan powder in acetic acid and a homogenous integration of the graphene. Different amounts of BiTO powder with various weight percent (x wt.%, with respect to Chitosan dry-base) were dispersed in the Chitosan/rGO solution through 30 min of ultrasonication, complemented by an additional 30 min of magnetic stirring. The solution was then degassed by ultrasonication for 15 min to remove any bubbles. Finally, 12 mL of each nanocomposite solutions were deposited in Petri dishes and dried during 24 h at 60 \xb0C to obtain the desired films, aligning with the intended experimental design ( ). The samples were cut to a surface area of 200 mmE^{2}. The samples were then poled with a 6 kV/mm DC electric field for 15 min, followed by a 24-h aging process in ambient air. The characterization was carried using a Bruker advance D8 eco diffractometer, (50 KV-20 mA) equipped with CuK\u03b1 radiation source (\u03bb = 1.5418 \xc5), the diffraction patterns were collected over a (2\u03b8) angular range of 5\xb0\u201370\xb0, using a size of 0.06\xb0 (2\u03b8) step and a constant counting time. Spectra were obtained by micro-Raman analysis using the \u201cXY\u201d spectrograph (Dilor, France) at room temperature in the spectral range (15 cmE^{\u22121} \u2192 2000 cmE^{\u22121}). As excitation source, we used the 514.5 nm line (slit = 80 \u03bcm) of an Air-iron laser. The measurements were performed at 20 mW for 200 s. Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy was realized using a spectrometer (Nicolet iS10 Thermo Fisher) equipped with Attenuated Total Refection (ATR) mounting in the wave number range between 525 and 4000 cmE^{\u22121} with a resolution of 2 cmE^{\u22121} and with 30 scans. A universal tensile machine (MTS criterion model 43) was used for the tests. The tests included measurements of tensile strength (TS) and elongation at break (%E) for young's modulus calculation. The samples used were cut into 10 mm \xd7 4 mm that were tested at room temperature (26 \xb1 1 \xb0C) with a crosshead speed of 0.1 cm/min. The general microstructural morphology of the calcined powders was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM hirox sh-5500p) operating at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV and combined with SE and BSE detector. With an emission current of 110u and a High Vacuum mode. To determine the chemical composition of the samples the SEM is joined also with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX). The piezoelectric coefficient (d33) was measured using a d33 meter (Sinocera, YE2730A). while the electrical conductivity of the BiTO/Chitosan/rGO composite was measured using an HP 4284A LCR Meter. The LCR Meter recorded the resistive component of impedance, which was used to calculate conductivity using the sample's dimensions and the measured resistance. To evaluate the energy harvesting capabilities of the BiTO/Chitosan/Graphene composite, voltage measurements were conducted under mechanical strain. A computer-controlled NewPort table applied harmonic strain, expressed as S (L)= S0cos ( wt), at a frequency of 6 Hz with a maximum transverse strain amplitude of 0.8 %. Voltage outputs were recorded using a voltage amplifier (Keithley 617). To optimize the piezoelectric composite energy harvesting response, A response surface methodology-based central composite design (CCD) was used. As presented in The CCD was based on five levels (\u2212\u237a, \u22121, 0, +1, + \u237a), with \u237a = 1.41421, and on two factors. \u2022 Factor A: weight percentage of ceramic  Factor A: weight percentage of ceramic The volume percentage of ceramic and polymer matrix plays a fundamental role in optimizing the response of our piezoelectric composite, directly influencing its overall piezoelectric effect.

In a 0\u20133 piezoelectric composite, only a small portion of the applied electric field effectively reaches the ceramic particles. In our Design Expert study, the addition of graphene (rGO) was chosen due to its recognized electrical conductivity. The optimization of the BiTO/Ch/rGO piezoelectric composite was studied in terms of Composite Young's Modulus, Composite Piezoelectric Coefficient, Composite Electric conductivity and Composite Output voltage (open circuit).

As a result, the desirability must be maximized close to 1, implying that the target is easily achievable. As a result, different criteria were used across the range of factors listed in , minimizing or maximizing with high (5) or medium (3) importance. The mathematical model was validated by running three confirmation runs under the best possible conditions, with a 95 % prediction interval. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted using ceramic weight percentage and graphene weight percentage as factors (5 levels) to check the model significance at a 95 % confidence level (p < 0.05). Design Expert software, Version 13.0.5.0, was used to design the experiments, as well as conduct the statistical analyses, optimization, and validation.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was utilized to examine the structural properties of the carbon compounds. The XRD patterns for GO and rGO are displayed in. Graphite exhibited a prominent and sharp diffraction peak at 2\u03b8 = 26.5\xb0, corresponding to the d002 interlayer spacing of 0.34 nm, as determined by the Bragg equation. In contrast, the GO XRD pattern showed a peak at 2\u03b8 = 10.2\xb0, indicating a d001 interlayer spacing of 0.9 nm.. This increase in interlayer spacing is due to the incorporation of oxygen-containing functional groups (hydroxyl, epoxy, carbonyl, and carboxyl) on the planes and edges of the graphite structure, confirming the complete oxidation of graphite to GO. During ultrasonication, the characteristic graphite oxide peak (001) at 2\u03b8 = 10.2\xb0 disappeared, indicating that the van der Waals bonds between adjacent GO layers had been broken, resulting in the complete exfoliation of the graphene oxide. The results showed significant variation in Young's modulus across different compositions presented in (response 1). These differences highlight the impact of composite formulation on mechanical properties, with Run 4 exhibiting the highest stiffness at 19.6 GPa and Run 3 the lowest at 1.84 GPa. To assess how the composites generate electrical voltage in response to applied mechanical strain, which is crucial for evaluating their energy harvesting performance. presents the output voltage results of different BiTO/Chitosan/rGO composites during the energy harvesting test. The maximum response is attributed to Run 4, which corresponds to a ceramic weight percentage of 50 % and a graphene weight percentage of 0.5 %, indicating a combination for maximizing the piezoelectric effect. In contrast, the minimum voltage value was observed in Run 3, where the absence of ceramic means no piezoelectric response. These results highlight the critical role of BiTO in generating an electrical response. , b providing a clearer comparison of peak voltages for each run. The electrical conductivity and piezoelectric coefficient d33 of the elaborated composites are also presented in. As shown in the experimental results for optimizing the piezoelectric composite response , the weight percentage of the ceramic Bi4Ti3O12 and graphene have distinct effects on the final response of our piezoelectric material BiTO/Ch/rGO. These experimental data were used to compute the coefficient of the polynomial equation, which was then used to predict the values of the response variables. presents regression equations for various responses in terms of uncoded values obtained through RSM. ANOVA analyses show that the experimental data fits a quadratic polynomial model. According to the ANOVA all regression model parameters have a probability (p) of less than 0.001, and therefore show no lack of fit. The regression coefficients for each model  were generally greater than 0.95. For Composite young's modulus Composite piezoelectric coefficient and Composite voltage output the coefficients were around 0.9. The predicted RE^{2} was around 0.7 for Composite electric. An RE^{2} value close to unity indicates that the empirical model is better fitted to the real data. A lower RE^{2} value indicates that the dependent variables are less effective that explaining behavioral variation (Henika, 1982). The difference between adjusted and predicted RE^{2} was consistently less than 0.2, indicating that the models accurately fit the experimental data. The experimental results from the design of experiments study demonstrate a clear relationship between ceramic and graphene weight percentages and the young's modulus of the BiTO/Ch/rGO composite. Variations in graphene weight percentage within the tested range had a lesser impact on young's modulus, the critical role of Bi4Ti3O12 ceramic in reducing flexibility was evident. Experimental design results show that absence of ceramic lead to an absence of a piezoelectric response (d33 = 0), while an increase in ceramic weight percentage resulted in an increase in the piezoelectric coefficient d33, reflecting an enhanced piezoelectric effect. Graphene weight percentage variations showed fluctuations in the d33 coefficient, the ceramic component primarily drove the piezoelectric response, with graphene content having a more subtle impact on the composite's piezoelectric properties. Kim et al. developed dielectric nanocomposites using poly(vinylidene) fluoride (PVDF), BaTiO3, and multiwall carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The CNTs were utilized both as a surfactant for BaTiO3 and as an electrically conductive filler. This approach led to enhanced permittivity and dielectric constant due to improved BaTiO3 dispersion and a reduced loss tangent. In , from row 3 to row 4, with the rGO content fixed at 0.5 wt%, the addition of 50 wt% BiTO resulted in a two-order increase in conductivity. This increase can be attributed to the synergistic interaction between the ceramic phase (BiTO) and the graphene phase. The high content of BiTO may lead to the formation of conductive pathways or the enhancement of percolation networks within the composite. The presence of rGO, known for its conductive properties, might assist in connecting these conductive pathways, thus contributing to the observed increase in conductivity. Equation illustrates the relationship between the electric field (Ec) acting on ceramic particles and their dielectric constants in a composite with a piezoceramic filler embedded in a polymer matrix. where \u03b5p and \u03b5c are the dielectric constants of the polymer and ceramic, respectively; E0 represents the electric field applied to the composite. Response optimization was carried out on piezoelectric ceramic weight percentage and graphene weight percentage based on the four measured responses (the composite young's modulus, piezoelectric coefficient d33, conductivity, and output voltage). According to the optimization plot (shown in ), the optimum formula selected is the one prepared using a piezoelectric ceramic weight percentage of 33.27 %, and graphene weight percentage of 0.8 % for 12.65 V for harvested voltage and 12.28 MPa for the composite young's modulus. Four experiments were conducted to validate the predicted values obtained using response surface methodology. presents the experimental values at the compromised level: 11.95 \xb1 0.27 MPa for young's modulus, 18.75 \xb1 3.44 for piezoelectric coefficient, and 12.05 \xb1 0.52 V for harvested output voltage. In a 0\u20133 piezoelectric composite like Bi4Ti3O12/Chitosan/graphene, the distribution influences the interfacial interactions between the ceramic, graphene, and polymer phases, affecting factors such as electron transfer, mechanical coupling, and polarization alignment. The distribution of BiTO particles and the rGO nanoplatelets in the chitosan matrix is presented in. The SEM and element mapping results showed that an optimum BiTO/Ch/rGO contents of 35 % wt% had a well-dispersed distribution. The element mapping images of the composite contain high levels of Ti, Bi, O corresponding to the Bi4Ti3O12 particles and C element corresponding to the nanoplates of reduced graphene. These EDX mapping results also confirm the good dispersion of the ceramic and graphene into the chitosan matrix without significant aggregation. To address this issue, a pre-dispersion through ultrasonication in a solvent proves to be an effective approach before incorporating the constituent elements of our composite, namely the chitosan and Bi4Ti3O12 ceramic.

High-purity (99.99 %) Bi2O3 and TiO2 oxide powders (Sigma-Aldrich) were used, with particle sizes ranging from submicron to ten microns. The powders were milled using an agate mortar and pestle to prevent agglomeration and ensure homogeneity, then dried at 150 \xb0C to remove moisture. Graphite powder (>45 \u03bcm, 99.99 % purity) and chemicals including sulfuric acid (H2SO4), potassium permanganate (KMnO4), sodium nitrate (NaNO3), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydrochloric acid (HCl), sodium dithionite (Na2S2O4), and hydrazine hydrate (N2H4) were also sourced from Sigma-Aldrich. In this study, we used Bi4Ti3O12 as the piezoelectric ceramic component. In our previous work , the Bismuth titanate (Bi4Ti3O12) was successfully synthesized. The synthesis was achieved through a solid-state reaction technique ( ), and the material was characterized using various methods, including XRD, Raman spectroscopy, TG/DTG, SEM/EDX. To ensure consistent high purity and a degree of deacetylation of 77 %, we opted for a custom extraction of chitosan.

The chitosan extraction process begins with by treating shrimp shells in a 10 % w/v sodium hydroxide solution to remove proteins, followed by hydrochloric acid treatment to remove calcium and obtain chitin. Washing and drying produce white chitin flakes, which are then deacetylated in an autoclave with a 45 % w/v sodium hydroxide solution, yielding chitosan flakes comprising 85 % of the total weight. Purification involves dissolving chitosan flakes in a 2 % acetic acid solution, neutralizing with 1N NaOH to pH 8, washing, and drying, resulting in pure chitosan stored for use. Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized using a modified Hummers' method.

Afterward, 50 ml of distilled water was added and the suspension was stirred at 98 \xb0C for 40 min. Finally, 16 ml of H2O2 (50 %) was added, followed by dilution with 260 ml of distilled water. The mixture was purified by centrifugation, washed with a 5 % aqueous HCl solution and distilled water until the pH was neutral, and then dried under vacuum at 60 \xb0C. Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was synthesized by exfoliating graphene oxide (GO) and then chemically reducing it with hydrazine. First, 50 mg of GO was dispersed in 50 mL of deionized water (1 mg/mL) and sonicated for 1 h. Then, 5 mL of hydrazine (N2H4) was added to the suspension, which was heated under reflux at 100 \xb0C for 12 h. The resulting graphite-colored product was cooled, filtered, washed with deionized water, and dried under vacuum at 60 \xb0C.

Different amounts of BiTO powder with various weight percent (x wt.%, with respect to Chitosan dry-base) were dispersed in the Chitosan/rGO solution through 30 min of ultrasonication, complemented by an additional 30 min of magnetic stirring. The solution was then degassed by ultrasonication for 15 min to remove any bubbles. Finally, 12 mL of each nanocomposite solutions were deposited in Petri dishes and dried during 24 h at 60 \xb0C to obtain the desired films, aligning with the intended experimental design ( ). The samples were cut to a surface area of 200 mmE^{2}. The samples were then poled with a 6 kV/mm DC electric field for 15 min, followed by a 24-h aging process in ambient air.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was utilized to examine the structural properties of the carbon compounds. The XRD patterns for GO and rGO are displayed in. Graphite exhibited a prominent and sharp diffraction peak at 2\u03b8 = 26.5\xb0, corresponding to the d002 interlayer spacing of 0.34 nm, as determined by the Bragg equation. In contrast, the GO XRD pattern showed a peak at 2\u03b8 = 10.2\xb0, indicating a d001 interlayer spacing of 0.9 nm.. This increase in interlayer spacing is due to the incorporation of oxygen-containing functional groups (hydroxyl, epoxy, carbonyl, and carboxyl) on the planes and edges of the graphite structure, confirming the complete oxidation of graphite to GO. During ultrasonication, the characteristic graphite oxide peak (001) at 2\u03b8 = 10.2\xb0 disappeared, indicating that the van der Waals bonds between adjacent GO layers had been broken, resulting in the complete exfoliation of the graphene oxide. The results showed significant variation in Young's modulus across different compositions presented in (response 1). These differences highlight the impact of composite formulation on mechanical properties, with Run 4 exhibiting the highest stiffness at 19.6 GPa and Run 3 the lowest at 1.84 GPa. To assess how the composites generate electrical voltage in response to applied mechanical strain, which is crucial for evaluating their energy harvesting performance. presents the output voltage results of different BiTO/Chitosan/rGO composites during the energy harvesting test. The maximum response is attributed to Run 4, which corresponds to a ceramic weight percentage of 50 % and a graphene weight percentage of 0.5 %, indicating a combination for maximizing the piezoelectric effect. In contrast, the minimum voltage value was observed in Run 3, where the absence of ceramic means no piezoelectric response. These results highlight the critical role of BiTO in generating an electrical response. , b providing a clearer comparison of peak voltages for each run. The electrical conductivity and piezoelectric coefficient d33 of the elaborated composites are also presented in. As shown in the experimental results for optimizing the piezoelectric composite response , the weight percentage of the ceramic Bi4Ti3O12 and graphene have distinct effects on the final response of our piezoelectric material BiTO/Ch/rGO. These experimental data were used to compute the coefficient of the polynomial equation, which was then used to predict the values of the response variables. presents regression equations for various responses in terms of uncoded values obtained through RSM. ANOVA analyses show that the experimental data fits a quadratic polynomial model. According to the ANOVA all regression model parameters have a probability (p) of less than 0.001, and therefore show no lack of fit. The regression coefficients for each model  were generally greater than 0.95. For Composite young's modulus Composite piezoelectric coefficient and Composite voltage output the coefficients were around 0.9. The predicted RE^{2} was around 0.7 for Composite electric. An RE^{2} value close to unity indicates that the empirical model is better fitted to the real data. A lower RE^{2} value indicates that the dependent variables are less effective that explaining behavioral variation (Henika, 1982). The difference between adjusted and predicted RE^{2} was consistently less than 0.2, indicating that the models accurately fit the experimental data. The experimental results from the design of experiments study demonstrate a clear relationship between ceramic and graphene weight percentages and the young's modulus of the BiTO/Ch/rGO composite. Variations in graphene weight percentage within the tested range had a lesser impact on young's modulus, the critical role of Bi4Ti3O12 ceramic in reducing flexibility was evident. Experimental design results show that absence of ceramic lead to an absence of a piezoelectric response (d33 = 0), while an increase in ceramic weight percentage resulted in an increase in the piezoelectric coefficient d33, reflecting an enhanced piezoelectric effect. Graphene weight percentage variations showed fluctuations in the d33 coefficient, the ceramic component primarily drove the piezoelectric response, with graphene content having a more subtle impact on the composite's piezoelectric properties. Kim et al. developed dielectric nanocomposites using poly(vinylidene) fluoride (PVDF), BaTiO3, and multiwall carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The CNTs were utilized both as a surfactant for BaTiO3 and as an electrically conductive filler. This approach led to enhanced permittivity and dielectric constant due to improved BaTiO3 dispersion and a reduced loss tangent. In , from row 3 to row 4, with the rGO content fixed at 0.5 wt%, the addition of 50 wt% BiTO resulted in a two-order increase in conductivity. This increase can be attributed to the synergistic interaction between the ceramic phase (BiTO) and the graphene phase. The high content of BiTO may lead to the formation of conductive pathways or the enhancement of percolation networks within the composite. The presence of rGO, known for its conductive properties, might assist in connecting these conductive pathways, thus contributing to the observed increase in conductivity. Equation illustrates the relationship between the electric field (Ec) acting on ceramic particles and their dielectric constants in a composite with a piezoceramic filler embedded in a polymer matrix. where \u03b5p and \u03b5c are the dielectric constants of the polymer and ceramic, respectively; E0 represents the electric field applied to the composite. Response optimization was carried out on piezoelectric ceramic weight percentage and graphene weight percentage based on the four measured responses (the composite young's modulus, piezoelectric coefficient d33, conductivity, and output voltage). According to the optimization plot (shown in ), the optimum formula selected is the one prepared using a piezoelectric ceramic weight percentage of 33.27 %, and graphene weight percentage of 0.8 % for 12.65 V for harvested voltage and 12.28 MPa for the composite young's modulus. Four experiments were conducted to validate the predicted values obtained using response surface methodology. presents the experimental values at the compromised level: 11.95 \xb1 0.27 MPa for young's modulus, 18.75 \xb1 3.44 for piezoelectric coefficient, and 12.05 \xb1 0.52 V for harvested output voltage. In a 0\u20133 piezoelectric composite like Bi4Ti3O12/Chitosan/graphene, the distribution influences the interfacial interactions between the ceramic, graphene, and polymer phases, affecting factors such as electron transfer, mechanical coupling, and polarization alignment. The distribution of BiTO particles and the rGO nanoplatelets in the chitosan matrix is presented in. The SEM and element mapping results showed that an optimum BiTO/Ch/rGO contents of 35 % wt% had a well-dispersed distribution. The element mapping images of the composite contain high levels of Ti, Bi, O corresponding to the Bi4Ti3O12 particles and C element corresponding to the nanoplates of reduced graphene. These EDX mapping results also confirm the good dispersion of the ceramic and graphene into the chitosan matrix without significant aggregation. To address this issue, a pre-dispersion through ultrasonication in a solvent proves to be an effective approach before incorporating the constituent elements of our composite, namely the chitosan and Bi4Ti3O12 ceramic.
