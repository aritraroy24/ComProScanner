Powders have been processed through a conventional solid-state reaction route using K2CO3, Na2CO3, and Nb2O5 (Alfa, purity>99 %) as raw materials for the nominal composition of K0.5Na0.5NbO3. The powder was first mixed and then calcined at temperatures ranging from 700 to 875 \xb0C for 5 h and then re-milled for 24 h at 250 rpm using a planetary ball mill (Pulverisette 5 Fritsch, Germany) with ethanol and yttrium stabilized zirconia balls in order to explore the influence of calcination temperatures on the material's properties. Prepared calcined powders were referred to as C-700, C-750, and C-875. Particle size distribution (PSD) analysis was carried out for powder-ethanol suspensions by laser diffraction (Saturn Digitizer, Micromeritics, USA). Differential thermal analysis/Thermogravimetric analysis (DTA/TGA) was carried out for the homogenized powder consisting of raw powders with designated stoichiometry by a thermal analyzer (STA 449 C Jupiter; Netzsch) in air. Heating rate was 3 \u2103/min. The diameter was 12 mm. Then water (5 % weight fraction) was added dropwise before the upper punch was inserted. Cold sintering-assisted (CSA) experiments were done using an SPS machine in vacuum (HP-D5, FCT Systeme, Rauenstein, Germany) TZM (Mo based alloy, Plansee, Austria). First, over 40 min, a force amounting to 45 kN, equivalent to a pressure of 400 MPa, was applied, all while maintaining a gradual temperature increase of 5 \xb0C/min, reaching 200 \xb0C (cold sintering step). Subsequently, a thermal post-treatment at 850 \xb0C for 25 min was done with a lower pressure of 245 MPa and a heating and cooling rate of 10 \xb0C/min. Accordingly, samples were re-oxidized for 6 h at 850 \xb0C in oxygen to equilibrate the point defects , as schematically depicted in. The samples that have undergone this cold-sintering assisted route and subsequent O2 annealing are labeled as P-KNN-T, where T is the indication of calcination temperature. The phase composition and structure were analyzed through X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/Max2550VB+/PC, Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan). The samples were ground and polished and then thermally etched at 800 \xb0C. The microstructure was investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM, XL 30 FEG, Philips, Eindhoven, Netherlands). The average grain size was calculated by considering size measurements of 50 grains. The grain size analysis was performed through Image J software (National Institutes of Health, USA). For transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis, the conventional preparation route was used. The specimen's thickness was reduced to 30 \u03bcm mechanically by grinding and dimpling, and then an ArE^{+} ion milling (GATAN 695, GATAN, Pleasanton, USA) was employed for final thickness refinement. The samples were attached to a copper ring with a 1.5 mm inner diameter. The analysis was done with a Talos F200X (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), operating at 200 kV and outfitted with a Super-X TEM integrated EDS system. This enabled the assessment of temperature-dependent dielectric permittivity and dielectric loss from room temperature up to 500 \xb0C using frequencies of 0.1 kHz, 1 kHz, 10 kHz, 100 kHz, and 1 MHz with an LCR meter (4284, Hewlett-Packard Corporation, USA). We also conducted impedance measurements, which spanned a temperature range of 100\u2013600 \xb0C and a frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 3 MHz by an impedance analyzer (alpha-Analyzer, Novocontrol Technologies, Germany). The model identification is achieved by the impedance analysis software RelaxIS (rhd instruments GmbH & Co. KG). Ferroelectric characteristics, polarization-electric field (P-E) and strain-electric field (S-E) hysteresis loops at room temperature were measured by applying 3 continuous bipolar waves of 5 kV/mm using a modified Sawyer-Tower circuit configuration and an optical displacement sensor (D63, Philtec Inc., USA). In addition, the polarization-stain-electric field data of the second bipolar wave (5 kV/mm, at 10 Hz) was extracted. The coercive field (E c ) is determined by averaging the absolute values of E c E^{ } and E c E^{ } (E c(ave)= E c ++ E c \u2212/2). The internal (bias) field (E i) was calculated using the equation ( E c +\u2212 E c \u2212)/2. The normalized piezoelectric coefficient d 33 * at room temperature, as a key indicator of piezoelectric performance, has been calculated based on d 33 *= S max/ E max, where S max and E max are the maximum strain and electric field extracted from the second cycle of strain-electric field data as the unipolar wave of the 4 kV/mm was applied. At last, the poling process with a DC electric field of 2.5 kV/mm is realized with a poling time of 30 min at 120 \xb0C. Then, d 33 was measured by a Berlincourt d 33 -meter (PiezoMeter System PM 300, Piezotest Pte Ltd.) at 110 Hz 24 h after poling.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Thermal analysis was performed on the starting powders of K2CO3, Na2CO3, and Nb2O5 with designated stoichiometry for KNN synthesis in air, as depicted in. The thermal decomposition consists of two stages; the first starts at 200 \xb0C and finishes at 413 \xb0C, in which a steady decrease of mass up to 413 \xb0C is visible. The second stage begins at 413 \xb0C, indicated by a slope change in the TG curve, and finishes at 640 \xb0C, with an exothermic peak. The summary reaction of alkali carbonates and niobium oxide is described by  Therefore, based on the TG/DTA analysis, a calcination temperature above 640 \xb0C should be necessary to complete the formation of the KNN phase ( it has also been previously shown that the formation of KNN occurs between 400 and 700 \xb0C , mostly characterized with the same decomposition step between 400 and 540 \xb0C and the reaction one between 540 \xb0C and the end of the reaction. For pure KNN, temperatures above 700 \xb0C are often suggested for the completion of solid-state chemical reactions. At all calcination temperatures, KNN phase peaks are present, but the peaks become sharper with increasing calcination temperatures. That means a higher crystallinity and could be confirmed by the full width at half maximum (FWHM) value of (110) diffraction peak. It should be noted that the powder calcined at 875 \xb0C shows less bimodality and tends to show a unimodal distribution, while the two others have two merged distributions, revealing a strong bimodal particle size distribution. However, the average particle size of the calcined powder at 875 \xb0C is 3.35 \xb5m, which is twice as large as powders calcined at lower temperatures ( ). XRD patterns of ceramics after densification and re-oxidation exhibit a typical orthorhombic perovskite structure, as shown in c. A stable solid solution with a small amount of secondary phase of K2Nb8O21 for P-KNN-750 and P-KNN-875 can be observed. Notably, the processing temperatures during densification (200 \xb0C) and re-oxidation (850 \xb0C) are much lower than the conventional sintering temperature window of 1100\u20131140 \xb0C and the SPS temperature window of 900\u20131000 \xb0C. The densities of the ceramics are nearly identical, approaching a value of 4.48\u20134.50 g/cm\xb3, corresponding to a relative density of 99.5\u201399.7 %. shows a fractured surface. The ceramics have a dense microstructure with cubic-shaped grains in all cases, which is typical for KNN. The grain size increases between P-KNN-700 and P-KNN-875, i.e., from 700 \xb0C to 850 \xb0C , but is generally in the range of the powder particle size, indicating very little grain growth. Within these SEM images, bimodal grain size distributions become evident. Bimodal grain size distributions and abnormal grain growth were previously reported for KNN and other niobates. A clear evolution emerges as we explore the relationship between calcination temperature and ceramic\u2019s final average grain size. The average grain size evolves from 0.227 \xb5m to 1.25 \xb5m for calcination temperatures 700 \xb0C and 875 \xb0C, respectively, as illustrated in. However, the calcination temperature does not influence the ceramics\u2019 density. To make sure that the presented route could produce a chemically homogeneous ceramic, EDS was performed. This is particularly important in the case of KNN, where the different dissolution rates of K, Na, and Nb might induce inhomogeneity. No discernible chemical contrast was evident by EDS Mapping (d), further ruling out the chemical inhomogeneity of our materials. Bright-field TEM images are shown in a\u2013f. In this aspect, KNN is different from other cold-sintered ferroelectric perovskites, such as BaTiO3, where dislocations are very uncommon. The observation of dislocations aligns, to some extent, with the findings of Tsuji and Nakagawa et al. in their study of KNN. Nakagawa et al. have claimed that dislocations could be largely eliminated by annealing at 700 \xb0C for 1 h. Hence, one could conclude that O 2 annealing at 850 \xb0C might have reduced the number of dislocations, although it did not completely eliminate them. This could be related to the nature of KNN, as the end member KNbO3 is one of the rare perovskite materials plastically deformable already at room temperature. One could consider the role of dislocations as 1D-defects and their contribution to electrical conductivity as a conductive and charge transport pathway or to large-signal piezoelectric coefficients or diffuse phase transition, where an increase in dislocation density may reduce the permittivity and cause a broadening of the phase transition region. Previous cold sintering approaches, using water as a liquid, yielded a density of only 85 % after annealing of 800 \xb0C for 2 h in air. Although ceramics prepared using KOH+NaOH (10 mol/L) could achieve densities above 95 % for KNN and BaTiO3 , the use of KOH+NaOH as the transient liquid can hinder industrial-scale production. In the cold-sintering assisted processes, stainless steel components such as punch, die, and cylinder are highly prone to corrosion, particularly at 300 \xb0C. Compared to previous work , in which it is claimed that post-annealing temperatures above 1000 \xb0C are necessary for the final densification of KNN, our investigation reveals that a high-density, pure KNN material can be successfully obtained through a CSA approach and subsequent O 2 annealing offering a promising avenue for sintering of pure and chemically-modified KNN. highlights a comparative view of the temperature-dependent dielectric permittivity and dielectric loss. Significantly, at room temperature, the relative permittivity of P-KNN-875 is observed to be the highest among the samples. However, there is no clear trend with increasing temperature as P-KNN-700 exhibits greater permittivity values compared to P-KNN-750. In this sequence, P-KNN-875 exhibits a higher permittivity than both P-KNN-700 and P-KNN-750, in descending order. The cold-sintered KNN ceramics exhibit a phase transition from orthorhombic to tetragonal (T O-T ) at 200 \xb0C. The Curie temperature T c is 410 \xb0C. Interestingly, the slightly higher T c observed in P-KNN-875 may be attributed to a subtle change in the lattice distortion , compositional fluctuations or due to a grain-size effect. In , the variations in permittivity (\u03b5\u2032 r ) with temperature are also depicted across different frequencies. At room temperature, the increased dielectric loss of P-KNN-700 and P-KNN-750 at low frequencies is evident. Meanwhile, a stable capacitance (C\u2019 P ) is observed for the P-KNN-875 sample. For P-KNN-700 and P-KNN-750 samples, leaky loops were discerned, indicative of a notable contribution from leakage current (a). Conversely, our large-signal data analysis reveals that the P-KNN-875 sample boasts well-defined ferroelectric polarization loops devoid of leakage with a saturated ferroelectric curve and a remnant polarization (P r ) of 26.7 \u03bcC/cm\xb2. This value surpasses the reported data for cold-sintered KNN ceramics in the literature. It is worth noting that pure KNN ceramics, in most cases, could not be densified through conventional sintering , thereby measuring a ferroelectric polarization loop was always challenging. Nevertheless, Haugen et al. reported that phase-pure KNN ceramic with a relative density of 94 % could only yield a remnant polarization of 9.8 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, which is significantly lower than that value of P-KNN-875. b shows the butterfly strain-electric field (S-E) curve for P-KNN-875 and P-KNN-700. For P-KNN-700, the significant differences between the samples were confirmed. Domain wall pinning by dislocation network has been observed for the BaTiO3 single crystals, where P r was hugely suppressed, and E c has been largely increased. Although high dislocation density exists in P-KNN-875, it seems that P r value is not noticeably affected by 1D defects, as P-KNN-875 still shows high Pr values similar to the highly dense hot-pressed KNN, where the sample was dislocation-free. Hence, the dislocation effect on KNN in the present study is not conclusive. Ultimately, a significant electromechanical response was observed for the sample when the calcining temperature increased to 875 \xb0C, as evidenced by the direct piezoelectric coefficient d 33 increase. This could be correlated with the highest permittivity and room temperature \u03b5 r (d 33\u221d \u03b5 r* P r/s) of this ceramic. For a more comprehensive perspective, unipolar strain measurements were conducted under a maximum electric field of 4 kV/mm (as depicted in c). These measurements revealed a significantly improved unipolar strain of 0.10 % within the P-KNN-875 ceramic, accompanied by an enhanced converse piezoelectric coefficient d 33 * value of 248 pm/V. This d 33 * value is 1.7 times higher than that of P-KNN-700 and P-KNN-750 ceramics. The pinnacle of these findings is the P-KNN-875 sample, showcasing the highest piezoelectric properties with a d 33 value of 120 pC/N and d 33 * value of 248 pm/V. These values could be particularly compared with KNN produced with other techniques. Regularly-sintered pure K0.5Na0.5NbO3 originally shows poor piezoelectric properties (d 33 \u223c 80\u2013100 pC/N) However, hot-pressed counterparts have been reported to have higher piezoelectric properties of d 33 = 141\u2013148 pC/N. To further evaluate the electrical properties of the ceramic samples, we conducted measurements of the frequency-dependent impedance across a temperature spectrum. displays the Nyquist plot of the complex resistance (Z\u2019-Z\u2019\u2019) at 400 \xb0C for all specimens. By investigating these two, measured data have been fitted using an equivalent circuit comprising one R-CPE-C (resistance-constant phase elements and capacitance). The semicircle with a capacitance range of 0.5 \xd7 10E^{\u201310} to 9 \xd7 10E^{\u201310} F can be observed within the measured frequency range (a), which can be correlated with the bulk ferroelectric response. Comparing the P-KNN-875 and P-KNN-750, we find a difference in the resistance values by a factor of 3  at 500 \xb0C. We noted differences between the samples\u2019 electrical conductivity with the help of Arrhenius plots (b). The activation energies (E a ) are determined to be 1.04\u20131.36 eV based on the slopes of fitting lines (b). Those extracted E a values are in the range of values reported for KNN and perovskite ceramics. When comparing ceramics, the changes in electrical conductivity and activation energy, then, could probably be rationalized through an intrinsic defect structure variation due to the unintentionally formed A-site vacancies and respective charge-compensating oxygen vacancies (V A \u2032 and V O \u2022\u2022) and holes h \u2022. The data were compared with hot-pressed pure KNN, shown by the solid line, which has comparable dielectric and electrochemical properties. The impedance results suggest that the current route eventually leads to a lower concentration of the intrinsic charge carriers and, subsequently, drastically lower conductivity than the hot-pressed KNN (as plotted in b). It would mean that although a larger/comparable d 33 can usually be realized in KNN produced with alternative techniques, such as hot pressing or spark plasma sintering , the higher concentration of intrinsic defects and, hence, increased conductivity make them unsuitable for high-temperature practical applications.

For P-KNN-700 and P-KNN-750 samples, leaky loops were discerned, indicative of a notable contribution from leakage current (a). Conversely, our large-signal data analysis reveals that the P-KNN-875 sample boasts well-defined ferroelectric polarization loops devoid of leakage with a saturated ferroelectric curve and a remnant polarization (P r ) of 26.7 \u03bcC/cm\xb2. This value surpasses the reported data for cold-sintered KNN ceramics in the literature. It is worth noting that pure KNN ceramics, in most cases, could not be densified through conventional sintering , thereby measuring a ferroelectric polarization loop was always challenging. Nevertheless, Haugen et al. reported that phase-pure KNN ceramic with a relative density of 94 % could only yield a remnant polarization of 9.8 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, which is significantly lower than that value of P-KNN-875. b shows the butterfly strain-electric field (S-E) curve for P-KNN-875 and P-KNN-700. For P-KNN-700, the significant differences between the samples were confirmed. Domain wall pinning by dislocation network has been observed for the BaTiO3 single crystals, where P r was hugely suppressed, and E c has been largely increased. Although high dislocation density exists in P-KNN-875, it seems that P r value is not noticeably affected by 1D defects, as P-KNN-875 still shows high Pr values similar to the highly dense hot-pressed KNN, where the sample was dislocation-free. Hence, the dislocation effect on KNN in the present study is not conclusive. Ultimately, a significant electromechanical response was observed for the sample when the calcining temperature increased to 875 \xb0C, as evidenced by the direct piezoelectric coefficient d 33 increase. This could be correlated with the highest permittivity and room temperature \u03b5 r (d 33\u221d \u03b5 r* P r/s) of this ceramic. For a more comprehensive perspective, unipolar strain measurements were conducted under a maximum electric field of 4 kV/mm (as depicted in c). These measurements revealed a significantly improved unipolar strain of 0.10 % within the P-KNN-875 ceramic, accompanied by an enhanced converse piezoelectric coefficient d 33 * value of 248 pm/V. This d 33 * value is 1.7 times higher than that of P-KNN-700 and P-KNN-750 ceramics. The pinnacle of these findings is the P-KNN-875 sample, showcasing the highest piezoelectric properties with a d 33 value of 120 pC/N and d 33 * value of 248 pm/V. These values could be particularly compared with KNN produced with other techniques. Regularly-sintered pure K0.5Na0.5NbO3 originally shows poor piezoelectric properties (d 33 \u223c 80\u2013100 pC/N) However, hot-pressed counterparts have been reported to have higher piezoelectric properties of d 33 = 141\u2013148 pC/N. To further evaluate the electrical properties of the ceramic samples, we conducted measurements of the frequency-dependent impedance across a temperature spectrum. displays the Nyquist plot of the complex resistance (Z\u2019-Z\u2019\u2019) at 400 \xb0C for all specimens. By investigating these two, measured data have been fitted using an equivalent circuit comprising one R-CPE-C (resistance-constant phase elements and capacitance). The semicircle with a capacitance range of 0.5 \xd7 10E^{\u201310} to 9 \xd7 10E^{\u201310} F can be observed within the measured frequency range (a), which can be correlated with the bulk ferroelectric response. Comparing the P-KNN-875 and P-KNN-750, we find a difference in the resistance values by a factor of 3  at 500 \xb0C. We noted differences between the samples\u2019 electrical conductivity with the help of Arrhenius plots (b). The activation energies (E a ) are determined to be 1.04\u20131.36 eV based on the slopes of fitting lines (b). Those extracted E a values are in the range of values reported for KNN and perovskite ceramics. When comparing ceramics, the changes in electrical conductivity and activation energy, then, could probably be rationalized through an intrinsic defect structure variation due to the unintentionally formed A-site vacancies and respective charge-compensating oxygen vacancies (V A \u2032 and V O \u2022\u2022) and holes h \u2022. The data were compared with hot-pressed pure KNN, shown by the solid line, which has comparable dielectric and electrochemical properties. The impedance results suggest that the current route eventually leads to a lower concentration of the intrinsic charge carriers and, subsequently, drastically lower conductivity than the hot-pressed KNN (as plotted in b). It would mean that although a larger/comparable d 33 can usually be realized in KNN produced with alternative techniques, such as hot pressing or spark plasma sintering , the higher concentration of intrinsic defects and, hence, increased conductivity make them unsuitable for high-temperature practical applications.
