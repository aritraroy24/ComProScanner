Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'solid-state reaction', 'precursors': ['BaCO3', 'SrCO3', 'TiO2', 'ZrO2'], 'steps': ['Mixed precursors in stoichiometric ratios and ball milled in ethanol at 400 rpm for 12 h', 'Dried the mixture', 'Fired at 1200 °C for 2 h', 'Blended calcined material with 5 wt% PVA', 'Compacted into discs (15 mm diameter, 1 mm thickness) at 10 MPa', 'Heated to 650 °C at 5 °C/min and held for 2 h to remove PVA', 'Sintered at 1400 °C at 5 °C/min for 3 h in air', 'Coated with silver paste and cured at 600 °C for 0.5 h', 'Polarized in silicone oil bath at 40 °C under 30 kV/cm DC field for 20 min'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'SEM', 'Dielectric thermospectrum meter', 'Ferroelectric tester', 'Quasi-static d33 meter']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
