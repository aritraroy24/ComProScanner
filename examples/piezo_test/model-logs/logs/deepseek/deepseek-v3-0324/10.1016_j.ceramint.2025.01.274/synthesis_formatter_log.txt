Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'Solid-state reaction', 'precursors': ['Pb3O4', 'SrCO3', 'MgO', 'Nb2O5', 'TiO2', 'ZrO2', 'MnCO3'], 'steps': ['Mixed precursors according to stoichiometric ratio and accurately weighed', 'Ball milled for 18 h', 'Dried powder calcined at 850 °C for 3 h', 'Added MnCO3 and ball-milled for 18 h', 'Pressed dried powder into disks using polyvinyl butyral as binder', 'Removed organics at 600 °C for 3 h', 'Sintered green discs at 1150–1250 °C for 3 h', 'Coated both sides with silver electrodes and held at 550 °C for 30 min', 'Polarized in silicone oil at 150 °C with DC electric field of 3 kV/mm for 35 min'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'SEM', 'LCR meter', 'Ferroelectric test system', 'XPS', 'Quasi-static d33 meter', 'Impedance analyzer']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
