In this study, FeE^{3+} was selected as the acceptor because it does not significantly reduce the Curie temperature of BaTiO3. Ba(Ti(100-x)/100Hf x/100)(100-y)/100Fe y/100O3-y/200 ceramics (abbreviated as BT-xHf-yFe) with x=9, 11, and 13 and y=0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 were fabricated by conventional solid-solution method. The raw chemicals of BaCO3 (99.8 %), TiO2 (99.8 %), HfO2 (98 %), Fe2O3 (99.9 %) were weighed according to the stoichiometric ratio, and ball-milled for 12 h with ethyl alcohol as the medium. The mixture was dried and then calcined at 1250 \u2103 for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 \u2103/min. Subsequently, the calcined powder was ball-milled again in ethanol for 12 h, and dried at 90 \u2103 for 3 h. This mixture was pressed into pellets with a diameter of 8 mm using 5 wt% PVA (Poly Vinyl Alcohol) as a binder, and heated at 500 \u2103 for 5 h to volatilize the PVA. The pellets were sintered at 1450 \u2103 for 4 h in air. The crystal structure of ceramics was determined by X-ray diffraction with Cu K\u03b1 radiation on a Shimadzu 7000 diffractometer. The grain structure and elemental analysis of samples were performed on the surface of the sintered ceramics using a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, su3500) with the energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The size of ferroelectric domains and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images were observed by transmission electron microscopy (JEOL JEM-2100F). Moreover, the convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) technique was employed to obtain information on the local crystal symmetry of the piezoelectric ceramics. Using piezo force microscopy (PFM, Cypher S) to detect the effect of acceptor doping on local depolarization of piezoelectric ceramics. The storage modulus and mechanical loss (tan\u03b4) were measured by DMA-Q800 (TA instruments) using a long bar. Before electrical and electromechanical testing, the samples were coated with Ag electrodes on both sides and heated at 700 \u2103 for 30 min. The dielectric permittivity versus temperature curves were obtained with a HIOKI 3532\u201350 LCR meter. The electrostrain of the samples was measured by an interferometer (AELSV120NGE, SIOS). To measure the piezoelectric coefficient and mechanical quality factor, all samples were poled in a silicone oil bath at 100 \u2103 and then cooled to 0 \u2103 under a DC field of 3 kV/mm (This poling condition is designed to promote the re-diffusion of oxygen vacancies, leading to faster and more effective aging.). The piezoelectric coefficient d 33 was measured using a commercial Berlincourt-type d 33 meter (ZJ-3A), and the mechanical quality factor Q m was calculated using the resonance-antiresonance method using a HIOKI 3532\u201350 LCR meter. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were performed using (XPS, Thermo Fisher ESCALAB Xi+, USA) to assess the relative oxygen vacancy concentration in the samples. To detect the crystal structural of BT-xHf-yFe samples, XRD experiments were performed at room temperature. reveals that all samples have a perovskite structure and no second phase exists. The R3m space group of our BT-xHf-yFe samples can be further determined by the Rietveld refinement of XRD data. The lattice constant and rhombohedral distortion (1-\u03b1) of BT-11Hf-yFe are shown in h. It can be observed that the lattice constant and rhombohedral distortion hardly change with the doping of FeE^{3+} ions due to the extremely small doping amount. Moreover, the reliability factors of Rwp, Rp and \u03c7E^{2} are in the range of 6.92 %-8.46 %, 4.84 %-6.31 % and 1.873\u20132.870, respectively. These results suggest that both the structural model of R3m and the refinement results are reliable. To examine the grain size and chemical homogeneity, SEM experiments were performed on all samples at room temperature. (a)-(g) indicates that the grain size remains relatively unchanged with the increase of HfE^{4+} doping amount. However, when FeE^{3+} is doped into BT-11Hf ceramic, the grain size gradually decreases with the increase of FeE^{3+} doping concentration. (h) shows the grain size decreases from 62 \xb5m to 15 \xb5m when the FeE^{3+} doping amount increases from 0 mol% to 1 mol%. To detect the elemental distribution, we performed the EDS scanning experiments of all ceramics. The EDS spectra show that the distribution of each element in all samples is homogeneous. In short, the prepared samples have good homogeneity in terms of crystal structure, grain structure and elemental distribution, and the doping elements (HfE^{4+}, FeE^{3+}) have been completely and uniformly diffused into all samples. First, HfE^{4+} ions were doped into BaTiO3 (BT) to find the quadruple point and IB. (a) shows the BT-xHf phase diagram, where the BT-xHf ceramics show cubic (C), tetragonal (T), orthorhombic (O) and rhombohedral (R) phases when x <11. With x approaching to 11, three phase boundary lines among C, T, O and R phases merge at a so-called quadruple point (QP), and the QP is located at x \u223c11, which is consistent with the previous report. When x >11, a single R phase region is formed below T C. (b) shows the permittivity and dielectric loss of BT-xHf as a function of temperature. When x= 11, the permittivity at T C reaches a maximum value, which is the evidence for QP. The vertical boundary below QP is the so-called IB, as shown in the phase diagram of (a). Next we present that the IB composition of BT-11Hf shows enhanced piezoelectric properties as compared with non-IB compositions. shows the composition-dependent maximum polarization P m, remnant polarization P r, coercive field E C, piezoelectric coefficient d 33 and maximum electrostrain S m curves with error bars of BT-xHf ceramics at different temperatures. A maximum anomaly of all these properties exists at the IB composition (BT-11Hf). This phenomenon is observed in the temperature range of 25 \u2103-45 \u2103, indicating that the IB composition exhibits enhanced dielectric, ferroelectric, and piezoelectric properties within this specific temperature range. This enhanced effect of IB is similar with that of MPB and PPB, yet with differences of the IB structurally characterized by single phase as shown in (a) and the MPB and PPB structurally characterized by multiphase coexistence. The acceptor dopant FeE^{3+} ions were introduced into IB composition (BT-11Hf) to improve the piezoelectric properties of Q m and d 33. exhibits the temperature-composition phase diagram of BT-xHf-yFe piezoelectric ceramics. As the y value of BT-11Hf-yFe increases, the Curie temperature gradually decreases. When y is greater than 1, the Curie temperature drops below 40 \u2103. To prevent depolarization and performance degradation, the doping amount of FeE^{3+} ions in this work is limited to y\u22641. To reveal the crystal structure of acceptor-doped IB compositions, the convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) technique was employed to investigate the samples. (a1)-(c2) shows the CBED pattern with [111] and [100] orientation of BT-11Hf-yFe (y=0, 0.5 and 1) samples at room temperature. All CBED patterns with [111] orientation have six mirror symmetries and all CBED patterns with [100] orientation have one mirror plane parallel with [110] direction, which are the structural characteristics of R phase. Therefore, all acceptor-doped IB compositions show R phase at room temperature. To confirm whether the acceptor dopant FeE^{3+} ions cause the components to deviate from the QP, we tested the permittivity (as shown in ), CBED (as shown in ), d 33 and Q m (as shown in ) data of two non-IB compositions, BT-10Hf-1Fe and BT-12Hf-1Fe, and IB composition, BT-11Hf-1Fe. The results indicate that BT-10Hf-1Fe displays two phase transition behaviors near TC. The permittivity and CBED test results show that its phase transitions are R-T phase transition (45.5\u2103) and T-C phase transition (54.5\u2103). On the other hand, BT-11Hf-1Fe and BT-12Hf-1Fe exhibited only one R-C phase transition. Moreover, composition dependence of d 33 and Q m of BT-xHf-1Fe piezoceramics indicated that BT-11Hf-1Fe has relatively high performance Hence, it is confirmed that a small amount of acceptor dopant FeE^{3+} ions does not cause the components to deviate from the QP. We also performed the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) experiment to find the possible atomic structure change of R phase. (a3)-(c3) show the HR-TEM images along the [110] orientation at room temperature, and the inserts are fast Fourier transformation (FFT) patterns. (a4)-(c4) show the inverse fast Fourier transformation (IFFT) images of BT-11Hf-yFe (y=0, 0.5 and 1), where the interplanar spacing d 001 changes from 0.400 nm, 0.401 nm, to 0.400 nm. shows the storage modulus and dielectric permittivity of BT-11Hf-yFe as a function of temperature. The inset in (b) shows the temperature-dependent dielectric permittivity of BT-11Hf-1Fe ceramic at different frequencies. This sample does not exhibit obvious frequency dispersion behavior, implying that the FeE^{3+} ion doping does not transform the ferroelectric into a relaxor. From y=0 to y=1, the modulus loss and dielectric loss are reduced by 3.6 times and 10 times, respectively ((c) and (d)), which indicates a significant enhancement of Q m as we will show below. (a) shows the composition-dependent d 33, Q m, and dielectric loss of BT-11Hf-yFe piezoceramics at room temperature. Q m was calculated from , where f a is the resonant frequency, f r is the anti-resonant frequency, Z m is the minimum impedance at the resonant frequency, and C is the capacity at 1 kHz. As y increases, d 33 initially decreases and then increases, while Q m increases consistently. When y=1, d 33 and Q m reach 337 pC/N and 1096 respectively. (b) further shows the temperature variation of d 33 and Q m of the BT-11Hf-1Fe,where both d 33 and Q m are superior to those of PZT-4 and PZT-8 from 0\u2103 to 40\u2103. Since the temperature rise of BT-based piezoceramics is on the order of 5\xb0C under a vibration velocity of \u223c0.3 m/sec which is the maximum vibration velocity of commercial hard PZT , our material BT-11Hf-1Fe can replace currently used PZT for underwater applications with a working temperature range from 0\xb0C to 30\xb0C. (c,d) shows the impedance |Z| and phase angle \u03b8 as a function of frequency for BT-11Hf-0Fe and BT-11Hf-1Fe piezoceramics. It can be seen that the BT-11Hf-1Fe ceramic exhibits a much lower Z m than the BT-11Hf-0Fe ceramic. When y=1, Z m can reduce to \u223c 5.3. The lower Z m is one of the reasons for the significant increase in Q m. shows the ferroelectric and electrostrain performance of BT-11Hf-yFe piezoelectric ceramics. When y changes from 0 to 1, the normal ferroelectric P-E hysteresis loop transforms into a double hysteresis loop in (a), which is consistent with previous reports. The electrostrain curve of BT-11Hf-1Fe ceramic in (c) also becomes almost hysteresis-free loop under a low electric field. (b) and (d) further show the composition dependence: with increasing y, the maximum polarization P m and the maximum electrostrain S m decrease relatively slowly, whereas the residual polarization P r and the hysteresis of the electrostrain curve decrease rapidly. The coercive field E C also increases rapidly after FeE^{3+} doping. Prior to a full understanding of high Q m and high d 33, we performed the piezo force microscopy (PFM) experiment to observe the domain switching, which helps characterize the pining effect from acceptor dopants. (a1) and (b1) show the PFM phase images of BT-11Hf-0Fe and BT-11Hf-1Fe samples without external field. It can be seen from the phase images that both samples exhibit a distinctly grainy, partially blurry PFM contrast. After we performed local poling experiments, (a2) and (b2) show that the ferroelectric domains of both samples are completely switched with the external field and the phase difference is 180\xb0. After 1 min, 5 min and 10 min, we performed PFM phase scans without DC bias on both samples. (a3)-(b5) show that the BT-11Hf-0Fe sample maintains a relatively intact domain state and does not undergo significant depolarization over time. However, the BT-11Hf-1Fe sample showed significant depolarization after poling. The ferroelectric domain at 5 min returns to its original unpoled state in most areas, which is attributed to the acceptor doping. To further investigate the effect of acceptor doping, we perform the XPS experiments to determine the concentration evolution of oxygen vacancies. shows that the peaks of XPS O 1 s of BT-11Hf-0Fe, BT-11Hf-0.5Fe and BT-11Hf-1Fe. The peak around 529.0 eV is ascribed to lattice oxygen (OL), and the peak around 530.9 eV can be attributed to non-lattice oxygen (ON) of surface adsorbed oxygen. With doping FeE^{3+}, the relative content of non-lattice oxygen gradually increases, which suggests that more oxygen vacancies are created in doped samples. The introduction of oxygen vacancies in BT-11Hf-1Fe provides a restoring force to the original ferroelectric domains , a double hysteresis  and an increase in Q m. To observe the evolution of d 33 with FeE^{3+} acceptor doping, we conducted a microscopic analysis of the domain structure. shows that the ferroelectric domain images along [111] orientation of BT-11Hf-yFe (y=0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1) piezoceramics at room temperature. With increasing y, the ferroelectric domain size increased from 115.3 nm for y=0\u2013179.3 nm for y=0.25, then decreases from 122.5 nm for y=0.5, 88.6 nm for y=0.75, to 52.0 nm for y=1. This domain size change sequence inversely coincides with the d 33 change sequence as shown in. Last, we use for a full understanding of high Q m and high d 33 from the acceptor-modified IB in BT-xHf-yFe ceramics. (a) shows that the acceptor-modified IB was achieved via HfE^{4+} and FeE^{3+} doped BT ceramics. Based the results in , the IB produces two effects (i) the low energy barrier of ferroelectric polarization rotation ((b)), and (ii) the single-phase region of IB ((c)). The lower energy barrier of IB composition compared to the neighboring off-IB composition is inherited from the quadruple point where the flattest free energy distribution exists in the phase diagram. Thus, it can be expected to observe an enhanced effect of dielectric, ferroelectric, piezoelectric properties such as d 33 at IB. The single-phase nature of IB as compared with multi-phase coexisted nature of MPB or PPB, leads to lower dielectric and mechanical loss, which implies that higher Q m can be obtained at IB. On the other hand, based the results in and , the acceptor doping of FeE^{3+} ions into IB composition also produces two effects of (i) a normal pinning effect ((d)) and (ii) significantly reduced domain size ((e)). (d) shows the systematic picture of the pinning effect caused by acceptor doping, which can limit the friction and vibration of domain walls and lead to high Q m. This is also the mechanism for increasing Q m of the ceramics locating at MPB or PPB. However, the IB composition is a single-phase state. Acceptor doping can be expected to have a more significant effect on improving Q m than acceptor doping in MPB or PPB compositions. The significantly decreased domain size should be a further reason for the high d 33 of this work. In short, the low energy barrier for polarization rotation of IB and the significantly decreased domain size by acceptor doping together contribute to the high d 33, and the enhanced pinning effect caused by acceptor doping into the single-phase IB region contributes to the high Q m. Naturally, the acceptor-modified IB strategy can simultaneously achieve high d 33 and high Q m ((f)), which overcomes the tradeoff relationship between d 33 and Q m in previous piezoelectrics.

In this study, FeE^{3+} was selected as the acceptor because it does not significantly reduce the Curie temperature of BaTiO3. Ba(Ti(100-x)/100Hf x/100)(100-y)/100Fe y/100O3-y/200 ceramics (abbreviated as BT-xHf-yFe) with x=9, 11, and 13 and y=0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 were fabricated by conventional solid-solution method. The raw chemicals of BaCO3 (99.8 %), TiO2 (99.8 %), HfO2 (98 %), Fe2O3 (99.9 %) were weighed according to the stoichiometric ratio, and ball-milled for 12 h with ethyl alcohol as the medium. The mixture was dried and then calcined at 1250 \u2103 for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 \u2103/min. Subsequently, the calcined powder was ball-milled again in ethanol for 12 h, and dried at 90 \u2103 for 3 h. This mixture was pressed into pellets with a diameter of 8 mm using 5 wt% PVA (Poly Vinyl Alcohol) as a binder, and heated at 500 \u2103 for 5 h to volatilize the PVA. The pellets were sintered at 1450 \u2103 for 4 h in air. The crystal structure of ceramics was determined by X-ray diffraction with Cu K\u03b1 radiation on a Shimadzu 7000 diffractometer. The grain structure and elemental analysis of samples were performed on the surface of the sintered ceramics using a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, su3500) with the energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The size of ferroelectric domains and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images were observed by transmission electron microscopy (JEOL JEM-2100F). Moreover, the convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) technique was employed to obtain information on the local crystal symmetry of the piezoelectric ceramics. Using piezo force microscopy (PFM, Cypher S) to detect the effect of acceptor doping on local depolarization of piezoelectric ceramics. The storage modulus and mechanical loss (tan\u03b4) were measured by DMA-Q800 (TA instruments) using a long bar. Before electrical and electromechanical testing, the samples were coated with Ag electrodes on both sides and heated at 700 \u2103 for 30 min. The dielectric permittivity versus temperature curves were obtained with a HIOKI 3532\u201350 LCR meter. The electrostrain of the samples was measured by an interferometer (AELSV120NGE, SIOS). To measure the piezoelectric coefficient and mechanical quality factor, all samples were poled in a silicone oil bath at 100 \u2103 and then cooled to 0 \u2103 under a DC field of 3 kV/mm (This poling condition is designed to promote the re-diffusion of oxygen vacancies, leading to faster and more effective aging.). The piezoelectric coefficient d 33 was measured using a commercial Berlincourt-type d 33 meter (ZJ-3A), and the mechanical quality factor Q m was calculated using the resonance-antiresonance method using a HIOKI 3532\u201350 LCR meter. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were performed using (XPS, Thermo Fisher ESCALAB Xi+, USA) to assess the relative oxygen vacancy concentration in the samples. To detect the crystal structural of BT-xHf-yFe samples, XRD experiments were performed at room temperature. reveals that all samples have a perovskite structure and no second phase exists. The R3m space group of our BT-xHf-yFe samples can be further determined by the Rietveld refinement of XRD data. The lattice constant and rhombohedral distortion (1-\u03b1) of BT-11Hf-yFe are shown in h. It can be observed that the lattice constant and rhombohedral distortion hardly change with the doping of FeE^{3+} ions due to the extremely small doping amount. Moreover, the reliability factors of Rwp, Rp and \u03c7E^{2} are in the range of 6.92 %-8.46 %, 4.84 %-6.31 % and 1.873\u20132.870, respectively. These results suggest that both the structural model of R3m and the refinement results are reliable. To examine the grain size and chemical homogeneity, SEM experiments were performed on all samples at room temperature. (a)-(g) indicates that the grain size remains relatively unchanged with the increase of HfE^{4+} doping amount. However, when FeE^{3+} is doped into BT-11Hf ceramic, the grain size gradually decreases with the increase of FeE^{3+} doping concentration. (h) shows the grain size decreases from 62 \xb5m to 15 \xb5m when the FeE^{3+} doping amount increases from 0 mol% to 1 mol%. To detect the elemental distribution, we performed the EDS scanning experiments of all ceramics. The EDS spectra show that the distribution of each element in all samples is homogeneous. In short, the prepared samples have good homogeneity in terms of crystal structure, grain structure and elemental distribution, and the doping elements (HfE^{4+}, FeE^{3+}) have been completely and uniformly diffused into all samples. First, HfE^{4+} ions were doped into BaTiO3 (BT) to find the quadruple point and IB. (a) shows the BT-xHf phase diagram, where the BT-xHf ceramics show cubic (C), tetragonal (T), orthorhombic (O) and rhombohedral (R) phases when x <11. With x approaching to 11, three phase boundary lines among C, T, O and R phases merge at a so-called quadruple point (QP), and the QP is located at x \u223c11, which is consistent with the previous report. When x >11, a single R phase region is formed below T C. (b) shows the permittivity and dielectric loss of BT-xHf as a function of temperature. When x= 11, the permittivity at T C reaches a maximum value, which is the evidence for QP. The vertical boundary below QP is the so-called IB, as shown in the phase diagram of (a). Next we present that the IB composition of BT-11Hf shows enhanced piezoelectric properties as compared with non-IB compositions. shows the composition-dependent maximum polarization P m, remnant polarization P r, coercive field E C, piezoelectric coefficient d 33 and maximum electrostrain S m curves with error bars of BT-xHf ceramics at different temperatures. A maximum anomaly of all these properties exists at the IB composition (BT-11Hf). This phenomenon is observed in the temperature range of 25 \u2103-45 \u2103, indicating that the IB composition exhibits enhanced dielectric, ferroelectric, and piezoelectric properties within this specific temperature range. This enhanced effect of IB is similar with that of MPB and PPB, yet with differences of the IB structurally characterized by single phase as shown in (a) and the MPB and PPB structurally characterized by multiphase coexistence. The acceptor dopant FeE^{3+} ions were introduced into IB composition (BT-11Hf) to improve the piezoelectric properties of Q m and d 33. exhibits the temperature-composition phase diagram of BT-xHf-yFe piezoelectric ceramics. As the y value of BT-11Hf-yFe increases, the Curie temperature gradually decreases. When y is greater than 1, the Curie temperature drops below 40 \u2103. To prevent depolarization and performance degradation, the doping amount of FeE^{3+} ions in this work is limited to y\u22641. To reveal the crystal structure of acceptor-doped IB compositions, the convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) technique was employed to investigate the samples. (a1)-(c2) shows the CBED pattern with [111] and [100] orientation of BT-11Hf-yFe (y=0, 0.5 and 1) samples at room temperature. All CBED patterns with [111] orientation have six mirror symmetries and all CBED patterns with [100] orientation have one mirror plane parallel with [110] direction, which are the structural characteristics of R phase. Therefore, all acceptor-doped IB compositions show R phase at room temperature. To confirm whether the acceptor dopant FeE^{3+} ions cause the components to deviate from the QP, we tested the permittivity (as shown in ), CBED (as shown in ), d 33 and Q m (as shown in ) data of two non-IB compositions, BT-10Hf-1Fe and BT-12Hf-1Fe, and IB composition, BT-11Hf-1Fe. The results indicate that BT-10Hf-1Fe displays two phase transition behaviors near TC. The permittivity and CBED test results show that its phase transitions are R-T phase transition (45.5\u2103) and T-C phase transition (54.5\u2103). On the other hand, BT-11Hf-1Fe and BT-12Hf-1Fe exhibited only one R-C phase transition. Moreover, composition dependence of d 33 and Q m of BT-xHf-1Fe piezoceramics indicated that BT-11Hf-1Fe has relatively high performance Hence, it is confirmed that a small amount of acceptor dopant FeE^{3+} ions does not cause the components to deviate from the QP. We also performed the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) experiment to find the possible atomic structure change of R phase. (a3)-(c3) show the HR-TEM images along the [110] orientation at room temperature, and the inserts are fast Fourier transformation (FFT) patterns. (a4)-(c4) show the inverse fast Fourier transformation (IFFT) images of BT-11Hf-yFe (y=0, 0.5 and 1), where the interplanar spacing d 001 changes from 0.400 nm, 0.401 nm, to 0.400 nm. shows the storage modulus and dielectric permittivity of BT-11Hf-yFe as a function of temperature. The inset in (b) shows the temperature-dependent dielectric permittivity of BT-11Hf-1Fe ceramic at different frequencies. This sample does not exhibit obvious frequency dispersion behavior, implying that the FeE^{3+} ion doping does not transform the ferroelectric into a relaxor. From y=0 to y=1, the modulus loss and dielectric loss are reduced by 3.6 times and 10 times, respectively ((c) and (d)), which indicates a significant enhancement of Q m as we will show below. (a) shows the composition-dependent d 33, Q m, and dielectric loss of BT-11Hf-yFe piezoceramics at room temperature. Q m was calculated from , where f a is the resonant frequency, f r is the anti-resonant frequency, Z m is the minimum impedance at the resonant frequency, and C is the capacity at 1 kHz. As y increases, d 33 initially decreases and then increases, while Q m increases consistently. When y=1, d 33 and Q m reach 337 pC/N and 1096 respectively. (b) further shows the temperature variation of d 33 and Q m of the BT-11Hf-1Fe,where both d 33 and Q m are superior to those of PZT-4 and PZT-8 from 0\u2103 to 40\u2103. Since the temperature rise of BT-based piezoceramics is on the order of 5\xb0C under a vibration velocity of \u223c0.3 m/sec which is the maximum vibration velocity of commercial hard PZT , our material BT-11Hf-1Fe can replace currently used PZT for underwater applications with a working temperature range from 0\xb0C to 30\xb0C. (c,d) shows the impedance |Z| and phase angle \u03b8 as a function of frequency for BT-11Hf-0Fe and BT-11Hf-1Fe piezoceramics. It can be seen that the BT-11Hf-1Fe ceramic exhibits a much lower Z m than the BT-11Hf-0Fe ceramic. When y=1, Z m can reduce to \u223c 5.3. The lower Z m is one of the reasons for the significant increase in Q m. shows the ferroelectric and electrostrain performance of BT-11Hf-yFe piezoelectric ceramics. When y changes from 0 to 1, the normal ferroelectric P-E hysteresis loop transforms into a double hysteresis loop in (a), which is consistent with previous reports. The electrostrain curve of BT-11Hf-1Fe ceramic in (c) also becomes almost hysteresis-free loop under a low electric field. (b) and (d) further show the composition dependence: with increasing y, the maximum polarization P m and the maximum electrostrain S m decrease relatively slowly, whereas the residual polarization P r and the hysteresis of the electrostrain curve decrease rapidly. The coercive field E C also increases rapidly after FeE^{3+} doping. Prior to a full understanding of high Q m and high d 33, we performed the piezo force microscopy (PFM) experiment to observe the domain switching, which helps characterize the pining effect from acceptor dopants. (a1) and (b1) show the PFM phase images of BT-11Hf-0Fe and BT-11Hf-1Fe samples without external field. It can be seen from the phase images that both samples exhibit a distinctly grainy, partially blurry PFM contrast. After we performed local poling experiments, (a2) and (b2) show that the ferroelectric domains of both samples are completely switched with the external field and the phase difference is 180\xb0. After 1 min, 5 min and 10 min, we performed PFM phase scans without DC bias on both samples. (a3)-(b5) show that the BT-11Hf-0Fe sample maintains a relatively intact domain state and does not undergo significant depolarization over time. However, the BT-11Hf-1Fe sample showed significant depolarization after poling. The ferroelectric domain at 5 min returns to its original unpoled state in most areas, which is attributed to the acceptor doping. To further investigate the effect of acceptor doping, we perform the XPS experiments to determine the concentration evolution of oxygen vacancies. shows that the peaks of XPS O 1 s of BT-11Hf-0Fe, BT-11Hf-0.5Fe and BT-11Hf-1Fe. The peak around 529.0 eV is ascribed to lattice oxygen (OL), and the peak around 530.9 eV can be attributed to non-lattice oxygen (ON) of surface adsorbed oxygen. With doping FeE^{3+}, the relative content of non-lattice oxygen gradually increases, which suggests that more oxygen vacancies are created in doped samples. The introduction of oxygen vacancies in BT-11Hf-1Fe provides a restoring force to the original ferroelectric domains , a double hysteresis  and an increase in Q m. To observe the evolution of d 33 with FeE^{3+} acceptor doping, we conducted a microscopic analysis of the domain structure. shows that the ferroelectric domain images along [111] orientation of BT-11Hf-yFe (y=0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1) piezoceramics at room temperature. With increasing y, the ferroelectric domain size increased from 115.3 nm for y=0\u2013179.3 nm for y=0.25, then decreases from 122.5 nm for y=0.5, 88.6 nm for y=0.75, to 52.0 nm for y=1. This domain size change sequence inversely coincides with the d 33 change sequence as shown in. Last, we use for a full understanding of high Q m and high d 33 from the acceptor-modified IB in BT-xHf-yFe ceramics. (a) shows that the acceptor-modified IB was achieved via HfE^{4+} and FeE^{3+} doped BT ceramics. Based the results in , the IB produces two effects (i) the low energy barrier of ferroelectric polarization rotation ((b)), and (ii) the single-phase region of IB ((c)). The lower energy barrier of IB composition compared to the neighboring off-IB composition is inherited from the quadruple point where the flattest free energy distribution exists in the phase diagram. Thus, it can be expected to observe an enhanced effect of dielectric, ferroelectric, piezoelectric properties such as d 33 at IB. The single-phase nature of IB as compared with multi-phase coexisted nature of MPB or PPB, leads to lower dielectric and mechanical loss, which implies that higher Q m can be obtained at IB. On the other hand, based the results in and , the acceptor doping of FeE^{3+} ions into IB composition also produces two effects of (i) a normal pinning effect ((d)) and (ii) significantly reduced domain size ((e)). (d) shows the systematic picture of the pinning effect caused by acceptor doping, which can limit the friction and vibration of domain walls and lead to high Q m. This is also the mechanism for increasing Q m of the ceramics locating at MPB or PPB. However, the IB composition is a single-phase state. Acceptor doping can be expected to have a more significant effect on improving Q m than acceptor doping in MPB or PPB compositions. The significantly decreased domain size should be a further reason for the high d 33 of this work. In short, the low energy barrier for polarization rotation of IB and the significantly decreased domain size by acceptor doping together contribute to the high d 33, and the enhanced pinning effect caused by acceptor doping into the single-phase IB region contributes to the high Q m. Naturally, the acceptor-modified IB strategy can simultaneously achieve high d 33 and high Q m ((f)), which overcomes the tradeoff relationship between d 33 and Q m in previous piezoelectrics.

In this study, FeE^{3+} was selected as the acceptor because it does not significantly reduce the Curie temperature of BaTiO3. Ba(Ti(100-x)/100Hf x/100)(100-y)/100Fe y/100O3-y/200 ceramics (abbreviated as BT-xHf-yFe) with x=9, 11, and 13 and y=0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 were fabricated by conventional solid-solution method. The raw chemicals of BaCO3 (99.8 %), TiO2 (99.8 %), HfO2 (98 %), Fe2O3 (99.9 %) were weighed according to the stoichiometric ratio, and ball-milled for 12 h with ethyl alcohol as the medium. The mixture was dried and then calcined at 1250 \u2103 for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 \u2103/min. Subsequently, the calcined powder was ball-milled again in ethanol for 12 h, and dried at 90 \u2103 for 3 h. This mixture was pressed into pellets with a diameter of 8 mm using 5 wt% PVA (Poly Vinyl Alcohol) as a binder, and heated at 500 \u2103 for 5 h to volatilize the PVA. The pellets were sintered at 1450 \u2103 for 4 h in air. The crystal structure of ceramics was determined by X-ray diffraction with Cu K\u03b1 radiation on a Shimadzu 7000 diffractometer. The grain structure and elemental analysis of samples were performed on the surface of the sintered ceramics using a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, su3500) with the energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The size of ferroelectric domains and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images were observed by transmission electron microscopy (JEOL JEM-2100F). Moreover, the convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) technique was employed to obtain information on the local crystal symmetry of the piezoelectric ceramics. Using piezo force microscopy (PFM, Cypher S) to detect the effect of acceptor doping on local depolarization of piezoelectric ceramics. The storage modulus and mechanical loss (tan\u03b4) were measured by DMA-Q800 (TA instruments) using a long bar. Before electrical and electromechanical testing, the samples were coated with Ag electrodes on both sides and heated at 700 \u2103 for 30 min. The dielectric permittivity versus temperature curves were obtained with a HIOKI 3532\u201350 LCR meter. The electrostrain of the samples was measured by an interferometer (AELSV120NGE, SIOS). To measure the piezoelectric coefficient and mechanical quality factor, all samples were poled in a silicone oil bath at 100 \u2103 and then cooled to 0 \u2103 under a DC field of 3 kV/mm (This poling condition is designed to promote the re-diffusion of oxygen vacancies, leading to faster and more effective aging.). The piezoelectric coefficient d 33 was measured using a commercial Berlincourt-type d 33 meter (ZJ-3A), and the mechanical quality factor Q m was calculated using the resonance-antiresonance method using a HIOKI 3532\u201350 LCR meter. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were performed using (XPS, Thermo Fisher ESCALAB Xi+, USA) to assess the relative oxygen vacancy concentration in the samples. To detect the crystal structural of BT-xHf-yFe samples, XRD experiments were performed at room temperature. reveals that all samples have a perovskite structure and no second phase exists. The R3m space group of our BT-xHf-yFe samples can be further determined by the Rietveld refinement of XRD data. The lattice constant and rhombohedral distortion (1-\u03b1) of BT-11Hf-yFe are shown in h. It can be observed that the lattice constant and rhombohedral distortion hardly change with the doping of FeE^{3+} ions due to the extremely small doping amount. Moreover, the reliability factors of Rwp, Rp and \u03c7E^{2} are in the range of 6.92 %-8.46 %, 4.84 %-6.31 % and 1.873\u20132.870, respectively. These results suggest that both the structural model of R3m and the refinement results are reliable. To examine the grain size and chemical homogeneity, SEM experiments were performed on all samples at room temperature. (a)-(g) indicates that the grain size remains relatively unchanged with the increase of HfE^{4+} doping amount. However, when FeE^{3+} is doped into BT-11Hf ceramic, the grain size gradually decreases with the increase of FeE^{3+} doping concentration. (h) shows the grain size decreases from 62 \xb5m to 15 \xb5m when the FeE^{3+} doping amount increases from 0 mol% to 1 mol%. To detect the elemental distribution, we performed the EDS scanning experiments of all ceramics. The EDS spectra show that the distribution of each element in all samples is homogeneous. In short, the prepared samples have good homogeneity in terms of crystal structure, grain structure and elemental distribution, and the doping elements (HfE^{4+}, FeE^{3+}) have been completely and uniformly diffused into all samples. First, HfE^{4+} ions were doped into BaTiO3 (BT) to find the quadruple point and IB. (a) shows the BT-xHf phase diagram, where the BT-xHf ceramics show cubic (C), tetragonal (T), orthorhombic (O) and rhombohedral (R) phases when x <11. With x approaching to 11, three phase boundary lines among C, T, O and R phases merge at a so-called quadruple point (QP), and the QP is located at x \u223c11, which is consistent with the previous report. When x >11, a single R phase region is formed below T C. (b) shows the permittivity and dielectric loss of BT-xHf as a function of temperature. When x= 11, the permittivity at T C reaches a maximum value, which is the evidence for QP. The vertical boundary below QP is the so-called IB, as shown in the phase diagram of (a). Next we present that the IB composition of BT-11Hf shows enhanced piezoelectric properties as compared with non-IB compositions. shows the composition-dependent maximum polarization P m, remnant polarization P r, coercive field E C, piezoelectric coefficient d 33 and maximum electrostrain S m curves with error bars of BT-xHf ceramics at different temperatures. A maximum anomaly of all these properties exists at the IB composition (BT-11Hf). This phenomenon is observed in the temperature range of 25 \u2103-45 \u2103, indicating that the IB composition exhibits enhanced dielectric, ferroelectric, and piezoelectric properties within this specific temperature range. This enhanced effect of IB is similar with that of MPB and PPB, yet with differences of the IB structurally characterized by single phase as shown in (a) and the MPB and PPB structurally characterized by multiphase coexistence. The acceptor dopant FeE^{3+} ions were introduced into IB composition (BT-11Hf) to improve the piezoelectric properties of Q m and d 33. exhibits the temperature-composition phase diagram of BT-xHf-yFe piezoelectric ceramics. As the y value of BT-11Hf-yFe increases, the Curie temperature gradually decreases. When y is greater than 1, the Curie temperature drops below 40 \u2103. To prevent depolarization and performance degradation, the doping amount of FeE^{3+} ions in this work is limited to y\u22641. To reveal the crystal structure of acceptor-doped IB compositions, the convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) technique was employed to investigate the samples. (a1)-(c2) shows the CBED pattern with [111] and [100] orientation of BT-11Hf-yFe (y=0, 0.5 and 1) samples at room temperature. All CBED patterns with [111] orientation have six mirror symmetries and all CBED patterns with [100] orientation have one mirror plane parallel with [110] direction, which are the structural characteristics of R phase. Therefore, all acceptor-doped IB compositions show R phase at room temperature. To confirm whether the acceptor dopant FeE^{3+} ions cause the components to deviate from the QP, we tested the permittivity (as shown in ), CBED (as shown in ), d 33 and Q m (as shown in ) data of two non-IB compositions, BT-10Hf-1Fe and BT-12Hf-1Fe, and IB composition, BT-11Hf-1Fe. The results indicate that BT-10Hf-1Fe displays two phase transition behaviors near TC. The permittivity and CBED test results show that its phase transitions are R-T phase transition (45.5\u2103) and T-C phase transition (54.5\u2103). On the other hand, BT-11Hf-1Fe and BT-12Hf-1Fe exhibited only one R-C phase transition. Moreover, composition dependence of d 33 and Q m of BT-xHf-1Fe piezoceramics indicated that BT-11Hf-1Fe has relatively high performance Hence, it is confirmed that a small amount of acceptor dopant FeE^{3+} ions does not cause the components to deviate from the QP. We also performed the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) experiment to find the possible atomic structure change of R phase. (a3)-(c3) show the HR-TEM images along the [110] orientation at room temperature, and the inserts are fast Fourier transformation (FFT) patterns. (a4)-(c4) show the inverse fast Fourier transformation (IFFT) images of BT-11Hf-yFe (y=0, 0.5 and 1), where the interplanar spacing d 001 changes from 0.400 nm, 0.401 nm, to 0.400 nm. shows the storage modulus and dielectric permittivity of BT-11Hf-yFe as a function of temperature. The inset in (b) shows the temperature-dependent dielectric permittivity of BT-11Hf-1Fe ceramic at different frequencies. This sample does not exhibit obvious frequency dispersion behavior, implying that the FeE^{3+} ion doping does not transform the ferroelectric into a relaxor. From y=0 to y=1, the modulus loss and dielectric loss are reduced by 3.6 times and 10 times, respectively ((c) and (d)), which indicates a significant enhancement of Q m as we will show below. (a) shows the composition-dependent d 33, Q m, and dielectric loss of BT-11Hf-yFe piezoceramics at room temperature. Q m was calculated from , where f a is the resonant frequency, f r is the anti-resonant frequency, Z m is the minimum impedance at the resonant frequency, and C is the capacity at 1 kHz. As y increases, d 33 initially decreases and then increases, while Q m increases consistently. When y=1, d 33 and Q m reach 337 pC/N and 1096 respectively. (b) further shows the temperature variation of d 33 and Q m of the BT-11Hf-1Fe,where both d 33 and Q m are superior to those of PZT-4 and PZT-8 from 0\u2103 to 40\u2103. Since the temperature rise of BT-based piezoceramics is on the order of 5\xb0C under a vibration velocity of \u223c0.3 m/sec which is the maximum vibration velocity of commercial hard PZT , our material BT-11Hf-1Fe can replace currently used PZT for underwater applications with a working temperature range from 0\xb0C to 30\xb0C. (c,d) shows the impedance |Z| and phase angle \u03b8 as a function of frequency for BT-11Hf-0Fe and BT-11Hf-1Fe piezoceramics. It can be seen that the BT-11Hf-1Fe ceramic exhibits a much lower Z m than the BT-11Hf-0Fe ceramic. When y=1, Z m can reduce to \u223c 5.3. The lower Z m is one of the reasons for the significant increase in Q m. shows the ferroelectric and electrostrain performance of BT-11Hf-yFe piezoelectric ceramics. When y changes from 0 to 1, the normal ferroelectric P-E hysteresis loop transforms into a double hysteresis loop in (a), which is consistent with previous reports. The electrostrain curve of BT-11Hf-1Fe ceramic in (c) also becomes almost hysteresis-free loop under a low electric field. (b) and (d) further show the composition dependence: with increasing y, the maximum polarization P m and the maximum electrostrain S m decrease relatively slowly, whereas the residual polarization P r and the hysteresis of the electrostrain curve decrease rapidly. The coercive field E C also increases rapidly after FeE^{3+} doping. Prior to a full understanding of high Q m and high d 33, we performed the piezo force microscopy (PFM) experiment to observe the domain switching, which helps characterize the pining effect from acceptor dopants. (a1) and (b1) show the PFM phase images of BT-11Hf-0Fe and BT-11Hf-1Fe samples without external field. It can be seen from the phase images that both samples exhibit a distinctly grainy, partially blurry PFM contrast. After we performed local poling experiments, (a2) and (b2) show that the ferroelectric domains of both samples are completely switched with the external field and the phase difference is 180\xb0. After 1 min, 5 min and 10 min, we performed PFM phase scans without DC bias on both samples. (a3)-(b5) show that the BT-11Hf-0Fe sample maintains a relatively intact domain state and does not undergo significant depolarization over time. However, the BT-11Hf-1Fe sample showed significant depolarization after poling. The ferroelectric domain at 5 min returns to its original unpoled state in most areas, which is attributed to the acceptor doping. To further investigate the effect of acceptor doping, we perform the XPS experiments to determine the concentration evolution of oxygen vacancies. shows that the peaks of XPS O 1 s of BT-11Hf-0Fe, BT-11Hf-0.5Fe and BT-11Hf-1Fe. The peak around 529.0 eV is ascribed to lattice oxygen (OL), and the peak around 530.9 eV can be attributed to non-lattice oxygen (ON) of surface adsorbed oxygen. With doping FeE^{3+}, the relative content of non-lattice oxygen gradually increases, which suggests that more oxygen vacancies are created in doped samples. The introduction of oxygen vacancies in BT-11Hf-1Fe provides a restoring force to the original ferroelectric domains , a double hysteresis  and an increase in Q m. To observe the evolution of d 33 with FeE^{3+} acceptor doping, we conducted a microscopic analysis of the domain structure. shows that the ferroelectric domain images along [111] orientation of BT-11Hf-yFe (y=0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1) piezoceramics at room temperature. With increasing y, the ferroelectric domain size increased from 115.3 nm for y=0\u2013179.3 nm for y=0.25, then decreases from 122.5 nm for y=0.5, 88.6 nm for y=0.75, to 52.0 nm for y=1. This domain size change sequence inversely coincides with the d 33 change sequence as shown in. Last, we use for a full understanding of high Q m and high d 33 from the acceptor-modified IB in BT-xHf-yFe ceramics.

In this study, FeE^{3+} was selected as the acceptor because it does not significantly reduce the Curie temperature of BaTiO3. Ba(Ti(100-x)/100Hf x/100)(100-y)/100Fe y/100O3-y/200 ceramics (abbreviated as BT-xHf-yFe) with x=9, 11, and 13 and y=0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 were fabricated by conventional solid-solution method. The raw chemicals of BaCO3 (99.8 %), TiO2 (99.8 %), HfO2 (98 %), Fe2O3 (99.9 %) were weighed according to the stoichiometric ratio, and ball-milled for 12 h with ethyl alcohol as the medium. The mixture was dried and then calcined at 1250 \u2103 for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 \u2103/min. Subsequently, the calcined powder was ball-milled again in ethanol for 12 h, and dried at 90 \u2103 for 3 h. This mixture was pressed into pellets with a diameter of 8 mm using 5 wt% PVA (Poly Vinyl Alcohol) as a binder, and heated at 500 \u2103 for 5 h to volatilize the PVA. The pellets were sintered at 1450 \u2103 for 4 h in air. The crystal structure of ceramics was determined by X-ray diffraction with Cu K\u03b1 radiation on a Shimadzu 7000 diffractometer. The grain structure and elemental analysis of samples were performed on the surface of the sintered ceramics using a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, su3500) with the energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The size of ferroelectric domains and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images were observed by transmission electron microscopy (JEOL JEM-2100F). Moreover, the convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) technique was employed to obtain information on the local crystal symmetry of the piezoelectric ceramics. Using piezo force microscopy (PFM, Cypher S) to detect the effect of acceptor doping on local depolarization of piezoelectric ceramics. The storage modulus and mechanical loss (tan\u03b4) were measured by DMA-Q800 (TA instruments) using a long bar. Before electrical and electromechanical testing, the samples were coated with Ag electrodes on both sides and heated at 700 \u2103 for 30 min. The dielectric permittivity versus temperature curves were obtained with a HIOKI 3532\u201350 LCR meter. The electrostrain of the samples was measured by an interferometer (AELSV120NGE, SIOS). To measure the piezoelectric coefficient and mechanical quality factor, all samples were poled in a silicone oil bath at 100 \u2103 and then cooled to 0 \u2103 under a DC field of 3 kV/mm (This poling condition is designed to promote the re-diffusion of oxygen vacancies, leading to faster and more effective aging.). The piezoelectric coefficient d 33 was measured using a commercial Berlincourt-type d 33 meter (ZJ-3A), and the mechanical quality factor Q m was calculated using the resonance-antiresonance method using a HIOKI 3532\u201350 LCR meter. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were performed using (XPS, Thermo Fisher ESCALAB Xi+, USA) to assess the relative oxygen vacancy concentration in the samples. To detect the crystal structural of BT-xHf-yFe samples, XRD experiments were performed at room temperature. reveals that all samples have a perovskite structure and no second phase exists. The R3m space group of our BT-xHf-yFe samples can be further determined by the Rietveld refinement of XRD data. The lattice constant and rhombohedral distortion (1-\u03b1) of BT-11Hf-yFe are shown in h. It can be observed that the lattice constant and rhombohedral distortion hardly change with the doping of FeE^{3+} ions due to the extremely small doping amount. Moreover, the reliability factors of Rwp, Rp and \u03c7E^{2} are in the range of 6.92 %-8.46 %, 4.84 %-6.31 % and 1.873\u20132.870, respectively. These results suggest that both the structural model of R3m and the refinement results are reliable. To examine the grain size and chemical homogeneity, SEM experiments were performed on all samples at room temperature. (a)-(g) indicates that the grain size remains relatively unchanged with the increase of HfE^{4+} doping amount. However, when FeE^{3+} is doped into BT-11Hf ceramic, the grain size gradually decreases with the increase of FeE^{3+} doping concentration. (h) shows the grain size decreases from 62 \xb5m to 15 \xb5m when the FeE^{3+} doping amount increases from 0 mol% to 1 mol%. To detect the elemental distribution, we performed the EDS scanning experiments of all ceramics. The EDS spectra show that the distribution of each element in all samples is homogeneous. In short, the prepared samples have good homogeneity in terms of crystal structure, grain structure and elemental distribution, and the doping elements (HfE^{4+}, FeE^{3+}) have been completely and uniformly diffused into all samples. First, HfE^{4+} ions were doped into BaTiO3 (BT) to find the quadruple point and IB. (a) shows the BT-xHf phase diagram, where the BT-xHf ceramics show cubic (C), tetragonal (T), orthorhombic (O) and rhombohedral (R) phases when x <11. With x approaching to 11, three phase boundary lines among C, T, O and R phases merge at a so-called quadruple point (QP), and the QP is located at x \u223c11, which is consistent with the previous report. When x >11, a single R phase region is formed below T C. (b) shows the permittivity and dielectric loss of BT-xHf as a function of temperature. When x= 11, the permittivity at T C reaches a maximum value, which is the evidence for QP. The vertical boundary below QP is the so-called IB, as shown in the phase diagram of (a). Next we present that the IB composition of BT-11Hf shows enhanced piezoelectric properties as compared with non-IB compositions. shows the composition-dependent maximum polarization P m, remnant polarization P r, coercive field E C, piezoelectric coefficient d 33 and maximum electrostrain S m curves with error bars of BT-xHf ceramics at different temperatures. A maximum anomaly of all these properties exists at the IB composition (BT-11Hf). This phenomenon is observed in the temperature range of 25 \u2103-45 \u2103, indicating that the IB composition exhibits enhanced dielectric, ferroelectric, and piezoelectric properties within this specific temperature range. This enhanced effect of IB is similar with that of MPB and PPB, yet with differences of the IB structurally characterized by single phase as shown in (a) and the MPB and PPB structurally characterized by multiphase coexistence. The acceptor dopant FeE^{3+} ions were introduced into IB composition (BT-11Hf) to improve the piezoelectric properties of Q m and d 33. exhibits the temperature-composition phase diagram of BT-xHf-yFe piezoelectric ceramics. As the y value of BT-11Hf-yFe increases, the Curie temperature gradually decreases. When y is greater than 1, the Curie temperature drops below 40 \u2103. To prevent depolarization and performance degradation, the doping amount of FeE^{3+} ions in this work is limited to y\u22641. To reveal the crystal structure of acceptor-doped IB compositions, the convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) technique was employed to investigate the samples. (a1)-(c2) shows the CBED pattern with [111] and [100] orientation of BT-11Hf-yFe (y=0, 0.5 and 1) samples at room temperature. All CBED patterns with [111] orientation have six mirror symmetries and all CBED patterns with [100] orientation have one mirror plane parallel with [110] direction, which are the structural characteristics of R phase. Therefore, all acceptor-doped IB compositions show R phase at room temperature. To confirm whether the acceptor dopant FeE^{3+} ions cause the components to deviate from the QP, we tested the permittivity (as shown in ), CBED (as shown in ), d 33 and Q m (as shown in ) data of two non-IB compositions, BT-10Hf-1Fe and BT-12Hf-1Fe, and IB composition, BT-11Hf-1Fe. The results indicate that BT-10Hf-1Fe displays two phase transition behaviors near TC. The permittivity and CBED test results show that its phase transitions are R-T phase transition (45.5\u2103) and T-C phase transition (54.5\u2103). On the other hand, BT-11Hf-1Fe and BT-12Hf-1Fe exhibited only one R-C phase transition. Moreover, composition dependence of d 33 and Q m of BT-xHf-1Fe piezoceramics indicated that BT-11Hf-1Fe has relatively high performance Hence, it is confirmed that a small amount of acceptor dopant FeE^{3+} ions does not cause the components to deviate from the QP. We also performed the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) experiment to find the possible atomic structure change of R phase. (a3)-(c3) show the HR-TEM images along the [110] orientation at room temperature, and the inserts are fast Fourier transformation (FFT) patterns. (a4)-(c4) show the inverse fast Fourier transformation (IFFT) images of BT-11Hf-yFe (y=0, 0.5 and 1), where the interplanar spacing d 001 changes from 0.400 nm, 0.401 nm, to 0.400 nm. shows the storage modulus and dielectric permittivity of BT-11Hf-yFe as a function of temperature. The inset in (b) shows the temperature-dependent dielectric permittivity of BT-11Hf-1Fe ceramic at different frequencies. This sample does not exhibit obvious frequency dispersion behavior, implying that the FeE^{3+} ion doping does not transform the ferroelectric into a relaxor. From y=0 to y=1, the modulus loss and dielectric loss are reduced by 3.6 times and 10 times, respectively ((c) and (d)), which indicates a significant enhancement of Q m as we will show below. (a) shows the composition-dependent d 33, Q m, and dielectric loss of BT-11Hf-yFe piezoceramics at room temperature. Q m was calculated from , where f a is the resonant frequency, f r is the anti-resonant frequency, Z m is the minimum impedance at the resonant frequency, and C is the capacity at 1 kHz. As y increases, d 33 initially decreases and then increases, while Q m increases consistently. When y=1, d 33 and Q m reach 337 pC/N and 1096 respectively. (b) further shows the temperature variation of d 33 and Q m of the BT-11Hf-1Fe,where both d 33 and Q m are superior to those of PZT-4 and PZT-8 from 0\u2103 to 40\u2103. Since the temperature rise of BT-based piezoceramics is on the order of 5\xb0C under a vibration velocity of \u223c0.3 m/sec which is the maximum vibration velocity of commercial hard PZT , our material BT-11Hf-1Fe can replace currently used PZT for underwater applications with a working temperature range from 0\xb0C to 30\xb0C. (c,d) shows the impedance |Z| and phase angle \u03b8 as a function of frequency for BT-11Hf-0Fe and BT-11Hf-1Fe piezoceramics. It can be seen that the BT-11Hf-1Fe ceramic exhibits a much lower Z m than the BT-11Hf-0Fe ceramic. When y=1, Z m can reduce to \u223c 5.3. The lower Z m is one of the reasons for the significant increase in Q m. shows the ferroelectric and electrostrain performance of BT-11Hf-yFe piezoelectric ceramics. When y changes from 0 to 1, the normal ferroelectric P-E hysteresis loop transforms into a double hysteresis loop in (a), which is consistent with previous reports. The electrostrain curve of BT-11Hf-1Fe ceramic in (c) also becomes almost hysteresis-free loop under a low electric field. (b) and (d) further show the composition dependence: with increasing y, the maximum polarization P m and the maximum electrostrain S m decrease relatively slowly, whereas the residual polarization P r and the hysteresis of the electrostrain curve decrease rapidly. The coercive field E C also increases rapidly after FeE^{3+} doping. Prior to a full understanding of high Q m and high d 33, we performed the piezo force microscopy (PFM) experiment to observe the domain switching, which helps characterize the pining effect from acceptor dopants. (a1) and (b1) show the PFM phase images of BT-11Hf-0Fe and BT-11Hf-1Fe samples without external field. It can be seen from the phase images that both samples exhibit a distinctly grainy, partially blurry PFM contrast. After we performed local poling experiments, (a2) and (b2) show that the ferroelectric domains of both samples are completely switched with the external field and the phase difference is 180\xb0. After 1 min, 5 min and 10 min, we performed PFM phase scans without DC bias on both samples. (a3)-(b5) show that the BT-11Hf-0Fe sample maintains a relatively intact domain state and does not undergo significant depolarization over time. However, the BT-11Hf-1Fe sample showed significant depolarization after poling. The ferroelectric domain at 5 min returns to its original unpoled state in most areas, which is attributed to the acceptor doping. To further investigate the effect of acceptor doping, we perform the XPS experiments to determine the concentration evolution of oxygen vacancies. shows that the peaks of XPS O 1 s of BT-11Hf-0Fe, BT-11Hf-0.5Fe and BT-11Hf-1Fe. The peak around 529.0 eV is ascribed to lattice oxygen (OL), and the peak around 530.9 eV can be attributed to non-lattice oxygen (ON) of surface adsorbed oxygen. With doping FeE^{3+}, the relative content of non-lattice oxygen gradually increases, which suggests that more oxygen vacancies are created in doped samples. The introduction of oxygen vacancies in BT-11Hf-1Fe provides a restoring force to the original ferroelectric domains , a double hysteresis  and an increase in Q m. To observe the evolution of d 33 with FeE^{3+} acceptor doping, we conducted a microscopic analysis of the domain structure. shows that the ferroelectric domain images along [111] orientation of BT-11Hf-yFe (y=0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1) piezoceramics at room temperature. With increasing y, the ferroelectric domain size increased from 115.3 nm for y=0\u2013179.3 nm for y=0.25, then decreases from 122.5 nm for y=0.5, 88.6 nm for y=0.75, to 52.0 nm for y=1. This domain size change sequence inversely coincides with the d 33 change sequence as shown in. Last, we use for a full understanding of high Q m and high d 33 from the acceptor-modified IB in BT-xHf-yFe ceramics. (a) shows that the acceptor-modified IB was achieved via HfE^{4+} and FeE^{3+} doped BT ceramics. Based the results in , the IB produces two effects (i) the low energy barrier of ferroelectric polarization rotation ((b)), and (ii) the single-phase region of IB ((c)). The lower energy barrier of IB composition compared to the neighboring off-IB composition is inherited from the quadruple point where the flattest free energy distribution exists in the phase diagram. Thus, it can be expected to observe an enhanced effect of dielectric, ferroelectric, piezoelectric properties such as d 33 at IB. The single-phase nature of IB as compared with multi-phase coexisted nature of MPB or PPB, leads to lower dielectric and mechanical loss, which implies that higher Q m can be obtained at IB. On the other hand, based the results in and , the acceptor doping of FeE^{3+} ions into IB composition also produces two effects of (i) a normal pinning effect ((d)) and (ii) significantly reduced domain size ((e)). (d) shows the systematic picture of the pinning effect caused by acceptor doping, which can limit the friction and vibration of domain walls and lead to high Q m. This is also the mechanism for increasing Q m of the ceramics locating at MPB or PPB. However, the IB composition is a single-phase state. Acceptor doping can be expected to have a more significant effect on improving Q m than acceptor doping in MPB or PPB compositions. The significantly decreased domain size should be a further reason for the high d 33 of this work. In short, the low energy barrier for polarization rotation of IB and the significantly decreased domain size by acceptor doping together contribute to the high d 33, and the enhanced pinning effect caused by acceptor doping into the single-phase IB region contributes to the high Q m. Naturally, the acceptor-modified IB strategy can simultaneously achieve high d 33 and high Q m ((f)), which overcomes the tradeoff relationship between d 33 and Q m in previous piezoelectrics.
