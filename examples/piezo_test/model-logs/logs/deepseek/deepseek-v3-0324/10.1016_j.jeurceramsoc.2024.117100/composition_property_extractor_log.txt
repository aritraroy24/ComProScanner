# ABSTRACT
High mechanical quality factor (Q
                     m) and high piezoelectric coefficient (d
                     33) are desired for high-power applications of piezoelectric ceramics. However, achieving them based on currently known mechanisms has proven challenging because of the tradeoff between Q
                     m and d
                     33. Here we report a surprising finding that this tradeoff can be overcome via acceptor-modified invisible-boundary (IB). High Q
                     m ∼1096 and high d
                     33 ∼337 pC/N were achieved and superior to those of both lead-free and commercial lead-based piezoceramics. The acceptor-modified IB was demonstrated in Fe-doped BaTi0.89Hf0.11O3 ceramics, where the acceptor doping in the IB composition increases Q
                     m by ∼8.6 times and d
                     33 by ∼1.5 times, being different from the acceptor doping effect in morphotropic/polymorphic phase boundary (MPB/PPB) compositions of increasing Q
                     m but decreasing d
                     33. We predict that our finding may also be made in other acceptor-modified IB systems and the obtained high-performance BaTiO3-based piezoceramic could provide an alternative to lead-based piezoceramics in underwater applications.

# INTRODUCTION
For high-power applications, they have to possess large vibration velocity vrms (vrms is proportional to Q m\xb7d) to generate large mechanical power; therefore, a high mechanical quality factor Q m and a high piezoelectric coefficient d (e.g., d 33) are required naturally. However, it is challenging to simultaneously achieve high Q m and high d 33, because these two properties are usually inversely proportional. This trade-off between Q m and d 33 is well demonstrated in commercial Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) piezoelectric ceramics, where the hard PZT piezoceramics have high Q m and low d 33 , and the soft PZT piezoceramics have low Q m and high d 33. It is known that the phase boundary engineering of MPB (morphotropic phase boundary) or PPB (polymorphic phase boundary) characterized structurally by multiphase coexistence has become the golden design rule for developing high d 33 piezoelectric materials due to the lower energy barrier for polarization rotations. However, the high d 33 is always accompanied by the low Q m due to the tendency for easy polarization rotations, which in turn leads to a large external field energy loss. Typical examples of such soft piezoceramics include PZT-5A (soft PZT) or (K,Na)NbO3-based ceramics. The high Q m is produced by acceptor dopants, which yet \u201cpin\u201d the ferroelectric domain wall and thus reduce the d 33. Typical examples include PZT-4 and PZT-8 ceramics (hard PZT piezoceramics) with high Q m and low d 33. It should be noted that although commercial PZT piezoceramics failed to overcome the trade-off between Q m and d 33, great efforts on the PZT family have been made due to its high properties in the past several decades. However, the PZT family is currently facing global restrictions due to the toxicity of its Pb to the environment and human health, and alternative lead-free piezoelectric materials have received widespread attention. Therefore, developing lead-free piezoelectric ceramics with both high Q m and high d 33 is in high demand and a great challenge. Our recent studies have shown that an unexpected finding of an electrostrain maximum occurs in the composition corresponding to an \u201cinvisible boundary\u201d in a ferroelectric single-phase regime of phase diagram, which is a vertical boundary starting from the quadruple point (QP) of the system. The invisible boundary (IB) is not a \u201creal\u201d phase boundary, but a range with enhanced electrical properties similar to the MPB. The IB is a vertical line starting from the quadruple point in the phase diagram. At the same measurement temperature, the IB component has enhanced polarization, electrostrain and other properties compared with the neighboring components. The high performance of IB composition is inherited from QP, which theoretically has almost no energy barrier for polarization rotation and polarization extension. Unlike MPB, where ferroelectric domains can easily rotate between different phases, and the high performance of the IB composition is mainly attributed to the effortless extension of ferroelectric domains within a single phase. This ability is inherited from the QP that theoretically has no energy barrier for polarization rotations. Since the IB composition is a single-phase state, it can highly expected to enhance Q m more significantly by acceptor doping and without the deterioration of piezoelectric properties. In this work, we report a design strategy of acceptor-modified IB engineering, which help simultaneously achieve high Q m and high d 33 in a model material of Fe-doped BaTi0.89Hf0.11O3 (BT-11Hf) ceramics. The simultaneous enhancement of Q m and d 33 from acceptor-modified IB engineering is clearly different from previously common observations of an enhancement of Q m and a deterioration of d 33 from currently known mechanisms of acceptor-modified MPB or PPB, as shown in. The obtained combination of high Q m up to 1096 and high d 33 up to 337 pC/N in BT-11Hf-1Fe is superior to that of both lead-free and commercial lead-based piezoceramics, thereby occupying a hitherto inaccessible \u201chigh Q m and high d 33\u201d regime of Q m vs. d 33 plot of. Below, we will first construct the IB in the BaTi1-x Hf x O3 ceramics and demonstrate the enhanced properties of the IB composition BT-11Hf, then show the high performance of acceptor-modified IB ceramics, and final present the understanding of achieving high Q m and high d 33 from the acceptor-modified IB. The materials in this work can maintain d 33 > 300 pC/N and Q m > 1000 in the temperature range of 0\u201340\u2103, which may meet the working requirements for underwater environments. Additionally, the BT system and the materials in this work have a relatively low driving electric field, making them suitable for use as a kind of piezoelectric transducer.

# CONCLUSION
In this work, we found an unexpected result in model BT-based ceramics: the trade-off between Q m and d 33 can be overcome by acceptor-modified IB. The acceptor-modified IB was demonstrated in BT-xHf-yFe ceramics, where the IB is a vertical boundary starting from the QP of BT-xHf phase diagram and the acceptor of Fe cations is doped into the IB composition BT-11Hf. The obtained BT-11Hf-1Fe ceramic shows both high Q m \u223c1096 and high d 33 \u223c337 pC/N, which is superior to that of both lead-free and commercial lead-based piezoceramics and occupies a hitherto inaccessible \u201chigh Q m and high d 33\u201d region of Q m vs. d 33 plot of piezoceramics. Therefore, our material overcomes the trade-off between Q m and d 33, which can be well understood based on the acceptor-modified IB. Clearly, this acceptor-modified IB engineering is different from previous known acceptor-modified phase boundary engineering that leads to common observations of \u201chigh Q m and low d 33\u201d or \u201clow Q m and high d 33\u201d.

It should be noted that although commercial PZT piezoceramics failed to overcome the trade-off between Q m and d 33, great efforts on the PZT family have been made due to its high properties in the past several decades. However, the PZT family is currently facing global restrictions due to the toxicity of its Pb to the environment and human health, and alternative lead-free piezoelectric materials have received widespread attention. Therefore, developing lead-free piezoelectric ceramics with both high Q m and high d 33 is in high demand and a great challenge. Our recent studies have shown that an unexpected finding of an electrostrain maximum occurs in the composition corresponding to an \u201cinvisible boundary\u201d in a ferroelectric single-phase regime of phase diagram, which is a vertical boundary starting from the quadruple point (QP) of the system. The invisible boundary (IB) is not a \u201creal\u201d phase boundary, but a range with enhanced electrical properties similar to the MPB. The IB is a vertical line starting from the quadruple point in the phase diagram. At the same measurement temperature, the IB component has enhanced polarization, electrostrain and other properties compared with the neighboring components. The high performance of IB composition is inherited from QP, which theoretically has almost no energy barrier for polarization rotation and polarization extension. Unlike MPB, where ferroelectric domains can easily rotate between different phases, and the high performance of the IB composition is mainly attributed to the effortless extension of ferroelectric domains within a single phase. This ability is inherited from the QP that theoretically has no energy barrier for polarization rotations. Since the IB composition is a single-phase state, it can highly expected to enhance Q m more significantly by acceptor doping and without the deterioration of piezoelectric properties. In this work, we report a design strategy of acceptor-modified IB engineering, which help simultaneously achieve high Q m and high d 33 in a model material of Fe-doped BaTi0.89Hf0.11O3 (BT-11Hf) ceramics. The simultaneous enhancement of Q m and d 33 from acceptor-modified IB engineering is clearly different from previously common observations of an enhancement of Q m and a deterioration of d 33 from currently known mechanisms of acceptor-modified MPB or PPB, as shown in. The obtained combination of high Q m up to 1096 and high d 33 up to 337 pC/N in BT-11Hf-1Fe is superior to that of both lead-free and commercial lead-based piezoceramics, thereby occupying a hitherto inaccessible \u201chigh Q m and high d 33\u201d regime of Q m vs. d 33 plot of. Below, we will first construct the IB in the BaTi1-x Hf x O3 ceramics and demonstrate the enhanced properties of the IB composition BT-11Hf, then show the high performance of acceptor-modified IB ceramics, and final present the understanding of achieving high Q m and high d 33 from the acceptor-modified IB. The materials in this work can maintain d 33 > 300 pC/N and Q m > 1000 in the temperature range of 0\u201340\u2103, which may meet the working requirements for underwater environments. Additionally, the BT system and the materials in this work have a relatively low driving electric field, making them suitable for use as a kind of piezoelectric transducer.

# CONCLUSION
In this work, we found an unexpected result in model BT-based ceramics: the trade-off between Q m and d 33 can be overcome by acceptor-modified IB. The acceptor-modified IB was demonstrated in BT-xHf-yFe ceramics, where the IB is a vertical boundary starting from the QP of BT-xHf phase diagram and the acceptor of Fe cations is doped into the IB composition BT-11Hf. The obtained BT-11Hf-1Fe ceramic shows both high Q m \u223c1096 and high d 33 \u223c337 pC/N, which is superior to that of both lead-free and commercial lead-based piezoceramics and occupies a hitherto inaccessible \u201chigh Q m and high d 33\u201d region of Q m vs. d 33 plot of piezoceramics. Therefore, our material overcomes the trade-off between Q m and d 33, which can be well understood based on the acceptor-modified IB. Clearly, this acceptor-modified IB engineering is different from previous known acceptor-modified phase boundary engineering that leads to common observations of \u201chigh Q m and low d 33\u201d or \u201clow Q m and high d 33\u201d.

# ABSTRACT
High mechanical quality factor (Q
                     m) and high piezoelectric coefficient (d
                     33) are desired for high-power applications of piezoelectric ceramics. However, achieving them based on currently known mechanisms has proven challenging because of the tradeoff between Q
                     m and d
                     33. Here we report a surprising finding that this tradeoff can be overcome via acceptor-modified invisible-boundary (IB). High Q
                     m ∼1096 and high d
                     33 ∼337 pC/N were achieved and superior to those of both lead-free and commercial lead-based piezoceramics. The acceptor-modified IB was demonstrated in Fe-doped BaTi0.89Hf0.11O3 ceramics, where the acceptor doping in the IB composition increases Q
                     m by ∼8.6 times and d
                     33 by ∼1.5 times, being different from the acceptor doping effect in morphotropic/polymorphic phase boundary (MPB/PPB) compositions of increasing Q
                     m but decreasing d
                     33. We predict that our finding may also be made in other acceptor-modified IB systems and the obtained high-performance BaTiO3-based piezoceramic could provide an alternative to lead-based piezoceramics in underwater applications.

# INTRODUCTION
For high-power applications, they have to possess large vibration velocity vrms (vrms is proportional to Q m\xb7d) to generate large mechanical power; therefore, a high mechanical quality factor Q m and a high piezoelectric coefficient d (e.g., d 33) are required naturally. However, it is challenging to simultaneously achieve high Q m and high d 33, because these two properties are usually inversely proportional. This trade-off between Q m and d 33 is well demonstrated in commercial Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) piezoelectric ceramics, where the hard PZT piezoceramics have high Q m and low d 33 , and the soft PZT piezoceramics have low Q m and high d 33. It is known that the phase boundary engineering of MPB (morphotropic phase boundary) or PPB (polymorphic phase boundary) characterized structurally by multiphase coexistence has become the golden design rule for developing high d 33 piezoelectric materials due to the lower energy barrier for polarization rotations. However, the high d 33 is always accompanied by the low Q m due to the tendency for easy polarization rotations, which in turn leads to a large external field energy loss. Typical examples of such soft piezoceramics include PZT-5A (soft PZT) or (K,Na)NbO3-based ceramics. The high Q m is produced by acceptor dopants, which yet \u201cpin\u201d the ferroelectric domain wall and thus reduce the d 33. Typical examples include PZT-4 and PZT-8 ceramics (hard PZT piezoceramics) with high Q m and low d 33. It should be noted that although commercial PZT piezoceramics failed to overcome the trade-off between Q m and d 33, great efforts on the PZT family have been made due to its high properties in the past several decades. However, the PZT family is currently facing global restrictions due to the toxicity of its Pb to the environment and human health, and alternative lead-free piezoelectric materials have received widespread attention.
