Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'solid-state reaction', 'precursors': ['Bi2O3', 'TiO2', 'Fe2O3', 'Yb2O3'], 'steps': ['Raw materials were mixed and milled with ZrO2 balls in ethanol for 12 h', 'After drying, the mixture was calcined at 750 °C for 3 h', 'Resulting powder was granulated with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) binders and pressed into disks 12 mm in diameter and 1.0 mm in thickness', 'Each disk was heated at 650 °C to burn off the PVA binder', 'Sintered at 1050–1060 °C for 3 h at a heating rate of 3 °C/min in an aluminum oxide crucible'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'Raman spectroscopy', 'FE-SEM', 'impedance analyzer', 'multimeter', 'source meter', 'TF Analyzer', 'd33 meter']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
