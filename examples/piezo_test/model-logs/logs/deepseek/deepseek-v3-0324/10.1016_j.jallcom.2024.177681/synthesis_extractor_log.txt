Lead-free (0.994-x)(K0.48Na0.52)(Nb0.97Sb0.03)O3-0.006BiFeO3-xBi0.5Na0.5ZrO3; KNNS-BF-xBNZ (x=0\u20130.12 mol%) were prepared by using a solid-state reaction method. Various raw materials were utilized, including K2CO3 (99.0 %), Na2CO3 (99.8 %), Nb2O5 (99.5 %), Sb2O3 (99.0 %), Bi2O3 (99.0 %), Fe2O3 (99.0 %) and ZrO2 (99.0 %). The stoichiometric raw materials were weighed and then ball-milled to reduce the particle size in alcohol for 24 hours. The mixed powder was dried to remove residual alcohol using a hot air oven at around 100\xb0C for 24 h, sieved to ensure uniform particle size, and calcined at 900\xb0C for 6 h. The fine powder was pressed into pellets using a uniaxial pressing with a pressure of about 100\u2013200 MPa to form dense pellets. The pellets were sintered at 1120\u20131140\xb0C for 3 h. Synthesis KNNS-BF-xBNZ ceramic and ceramic powder as seen in. KNNS-BF-xBNZ ceramics with the optimum piezoelectric properties at x=0.03 mol% were chosen to fabricate composite films. Firstly, the KNNS-BF-xBNZ ceramic powder was dispersed in ethyl alcohol (99.8 %) using sonication for 3 h. to break up the agglomerates. After that, the dispersed powder was mixed with PDMS in various proportions, ranging from 0 to 30 wt%, and then combined with curing agent (PDMS to curing agent ratio of 10:1). The mixture was loaded into a syringe to pour a thin layer into a prepared mold and then placed at room temperature for 48 hours. Afterward, the dried KNNS-BF-xBNZ/PDMS film was cut into sheets 3\xd73 cm. and a thickness of 3 mm (see in (a)). To prepare the PENG device, the KNNS-BF-3BNZ/PDMS composite film is sandwiched between aluminum foil sheets on both the top and bottom surfaces to serve as electrodes. The KNNS-BF-3BNZ/PDMS composite film is used for the bottom layer as the main triboelectric layer. The fabrication process of the KNNS-BF-3BNZ composite film for hybrid piezo/triboelectric devices is illustrated in (d). The phase formation of the samples was examined through X-ray diffraction (Philips PW 3040/60 X\u2032Pert Pro) in a 2\u03b8 range of 10\xb0-90\xb0. The surface and cross-section morphology of the samples were analyzed using field emission scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (FESEM-EDX, Apreo, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). To characterize the dielectric, piezoelectric, and ferroelectric properties, samples were polished on both sides, coated with silver paste, and fired at 600 \xb0C for 30 minutes. The dielectric properties of the samples were measured using an LCR meter (Agilent 4284 A) connected to a computer. The polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loops were recorded using a ferroelectric test system (Radiant, PLC2\u20131014346). The piezoelectric constant (d 33) values were measured using a quasi-static d 33-meter (Sinocera, YE2730A). The output voltage and current were measured using a digital oscilloscope (Keysight/Agilent: DSO-X-2022A model) and a digital multimeter (Rigol: DM 3058E model).

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The phase structure of KNNS-BF-xBNZ ceramics with different x contents is shown in. This confirms that BNZ has completely diffused into the KNNS-BF lattice, forming a new solid solution within the range of 0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.12 mol.%. XRD patterns in the 2\u03b8 range of 44.5\xb0 to 46.5\xb0, where Lorentz curves can fit the partial intensity profile for different compositions theoretically, are shown in the panels on the right in (b). At x=0 mol.%, the samples show four intensities peak of 002 T (red line), 200 T (blue line), 202 O (green line) and 020 O (light bule line), suggesting that the coexist phase between othorhombic and tetragonal phase. At x=0.03 mol.%, an intensity peak showed double peak of 002 T and 200 T and single peak of 202 R (green line). Therefore, the ceramics with 0.03 present the R-T phase structure. When increased of x>0.03 mol.%, the double peak of 002 T and 200 T was suppressed and 202 R peak continuous increased. Detailed phase analysis of samples at difference of x contents was performed XRD Rietveld refinements, as seen in (c-d) and. The FullProf program was used to perform all the XRD Rietveld refinements. The samples with x=0 mol.% exhibited O-T phase structure, where the O phase accounts for 45.7 % (Amm 2 space groups), and the T phase accounts for 54.3 % (P4mm space groups). At x=0.03 mol%, the samples demonstrated R-T phase with the R phase accounts for 62.0 % (R3m space groups) and T phase accounts for 38.0 % (P4mm space groups). When increased of x>0.03 mol.%, the proportion of T phase decreased and R phase continued increased from 38.0 % to 5.0 and 62.0\u201395.0 %, respectively. Therefore, the results from XRD Rietveld refinements indicate that the sample with x = 0 mol% is an orthorhombic-tetragonal (O-T) phase, while samples with x = 0.03\u20130.12 mol.% are rhombohedral-tetragonal (R-T) phases and become more rhombohedral as the x content increases. The surface morphology of KNNS-BF-xBNZ ceramics with varying x contents is shown in (e)\u2013(g). At x = 0 mol%, the average grain size was approximately 0.41 \u03bcm. As x increased from 0 to 0.03 mol%, the average grain size grew from 0.41 to 0.56 \u03bcm. This growth can be attributed to enhanced densification and particle coalescence during the sintering process at lower BNZ concentrations, which facilitates grain growth. However, when x exceeded 0.03 mol%, the average grain size decreased from 0.56 to 0.38 \u03bcm. This reduction in grain size at higher BNZ concentrations can be explained by the excess BNZ, which tends to aggregate at the grain boundaries, thereby hindering further grain growth. The dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) and dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) of KNNS-BF-xBNZ ceramics as a function of temperature at different x contents are shown in (a)-(c) and (d)-(f), respectively. The samples were measured in the temperature range from \u221255\xb0C to 450\xb0C for x=0 mol.% and room temperature (T room) to 450\xb0C for x>0 mol.%, with a frequency range from 1 kHz to 1 MHz. At x=0 mol.%, three abnormal dielectric peaks were observed, corresponding to the R-O phase transition (T R-O= \u223c23\xb0C), the O-T phase transition (T O-T =152\xb0C) and the Curie temperature (T C=321\xb0C), respectively (as seen in (a)). The T O-T became broader and shifted to a lower temperature region, indicating the formation of an R\u2013T (T R-T) phase transition in the composition of x=0.03 mol%, as seen in (b). As the value of x\u22650.06 mol.% increased further (as illustrated in (c)), the T R\u2212T phase transition disappeared, leaving only a single abnormal dielectric peak corresponding to the Curie temperature (T C). However, the \u03b5 r at T C increases dramatically while T C decreases continuously, yet remains above room temperature. This confirms that samples with x\u22650.06 mol.% primarily exhibit a ferroelectric rhombohedral phase rather than a cubic phase, as seen in (a). The \u03b5 r and tan\u03b4 are 3622 and 0.21, respectively, at a composition of x=0 mol.%. With an increase of x=0.03 mol.%, \u03b5 r increased from 3622 to 3854 while tan\u03b4 decreased from 0.21 to 0.15. However, at x=0.06 mol.%, although the \u03b5 r continued to increase from 3854 to 6884, the tan\u03b4 also reached its highest value. As x further increased, both \u03b5r and tan\u03b4 a decreasing trend, as seen in (a)-(c). This indicates that the x(BNZ) content can improved both \u03b5 r and tan\u03b4 in the composition of x=0.03 mol.%. The P-E hysteresis loops of KNNS-BF-xBNZ ceramics at different x contents are shown in (e). They all exhibit a well-saturated P\u2013E hysteresis loop under an electric field of a 60 kV/cm. At x=0 mol.%, the value of P r, P s and E c are 13.7 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, 25.7 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} and 14.9 kV/cm, respectively. As x increased to 0.03 mol.%, the value of P r and P s increased from 13.7 to 18.8 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} and 25.7\u201330.3 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, respectively, while E c decreased. This increase in P r and P s can be attributed to the formation of a new MPB of R-T phase near room temperature , as confirmed by the XRD results. This behavior can be attributed to the ceramic primarily exhibiting a ferroelectric rhombohedral phase, consistent with the XRD results. The rhombohedral phase, characterized by high symmetry, is therefore responsible for the reduction in ferroelectricity observed in ceramics with x > 0.03 mol%. Additionally, a decrease in grain size in these samples may further hinder domain mobility , as evidenced by the FESEM results shown in (g). Consequently, this contributes to a weaker ferroelectric response in ceramics with x > 0.03 mol%. The d 33 of KNNS-BF-xBNZ ceramics at different x contents is illustrated in (d). The results indicate that the introduction of BNZ improves the piezoelectric properties. At x = 0 mol%, d 33 is approximately 293 pC/N. The value of d 33 initially increased, reaching a maximum of 358 pC/N at x = 0.03 mol%, which corresponds to a region near the rhombohedral-tetragonal (R\u2013T) phase boundary, before continuously decreasing, as depicted in (g). This observed maximum is higher than previous work, such as KNNS (d 33 = 120 pC/N) , and KNNS-0.03BNZ (d 33 = 257 pC/N). The increase in d 33 can be explained by the polarization rotation and enhanced domain wall motion near the R\u2013T phase boundary during poling , leading to improved piezoelectric properties. In the vicinity of the R\u2013T phase boundary, the co-existence of phases allows for easier reorientation of the polarization vector, thereby enhancing the electromechanical coupling. As a result, ceramics with a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) near room temperature exhibit significantly enhanced piezoelectric properties along with notable ferroelectric properties. However, the decrease in d 33 at higher x values can be attributed to the reduction in grain size and the increased presence of the rhombohedral structure, as observed in the FESEM and XRD analyses. To study energy harvesting properties, a sample with a composition of x=0.03 mol.% that demonstrates good electrical properties has been chosen to fabricate KNNS-BF-xBNZ/PDMS composite films. Hereafter, this sample will be referred to as KNNS-BF-3BNZ. The ceramic powders (KNNS-BF-3BNZ) were added to the PDMS matrix in ratios ranging from 0 to 30 wt%. The surface and cross-sectional morphology from FESEM-EDS of KNNS-BF-3BNZ/PDMS are shown in. The images indicate that pure PDMS has a smooth surface, as shown in (a), and a homogeneous cross-section, as depicted in (d). When EDS is performed on the surface of PDMS (spot 1), it reveals the presence of Si=40.9 %, C=37.8 %, and O=21.3 % ((g)). When KNNS-BF-3BNZ at 15 wt% is added to PDMS, the particles exhibit a clustered distribution within the PDMS matrix as seen in (b) and (e). EDS analysis of the first area (spot 2) shows the presence of elements from both PDMS and KNNS-BF-3BNZ with Si being the predominant component due to its high concentration of PDMS ((h)). In contrast, the analysis of the second area (spot 3) reveals a higher concentration of elements from KNNS-BF-3BNZ, with a lower amount of Si compared to spot 2 ((i)). The particles also exhibit a clustered distribution at a high concentration of KNNS-BF-3BNZ at 30 wt%. However, the particles become more apparent on the surface of the PDMS, indicating an excessive amount of KNNS-BF-3BNZ in the composite ((c)). (a)-(k) presents the EDS mapping analysis of KNNS-BF-3BNZ at 15 wt%. It shows that Si, C, and O are uniformly distributed across the sample, while Nb, Zr, Fe, Bi, Sb, Na, and K are found in clusters with some regions dispersed throughout the PDMS. These results confirm that KNNS-BF-3BNZ ceramic particles exhibit a clustered distribution within the PDMS matrix. The output voltage and current waveforms were recorded as V OC and I SC, respectively, under controlled relative humidity (RH) of 48.5 \xb1 5 % during the contact-separation process. An automatic compressing machine (ACM) operated vertically at a frequency of 10 Hz. The results for the KNNS-BF-3BNZ/PDMS composite films prepared using the PENG, TENG, and hybrid PENG-TENG methods are illustrated in (a) and (b). The PENG method produced a maximum V OC of 9 V, while the TENG method demonstrated a V OC of 33 V. The hybrid PENG-TENG method achieved the highest V OC of 107 V, indicating a synergistic enhancement in voltage output, as shown in (a). (b) presents the I SC values for the same composite films. The PENG method exhibits a maximum I SC of 0.23 \u03bcA, whereas the TENG method shows an I SC of 0.39 \u03bcA. The hybrid PENG and TENG approach achieves the highest ISC of 4.68 \u03bcA, reflecting the combined effect of both piezoelectric and triboelectric mechanisms. These results indicate that the hybrid PENG and TENG method significantly enhances both the V OC and I SC values compared to the individual PENG and TENG methods, making it a promising approach for improving the performance of energy harvesting devices. The mechanism of the hybrid PENG and TENG operates as follows, see in (c). When the KNNS-BF-3BNZ/PDMS composite film and the aluminum electrode are pressed together, electrons are transferred from one material to another due to differences in their triboelectric properties, creating a triboelectric charge. In the releasing state ((c)II), the mechanical deformation of the piezoelectric material is reduced, and the triboelectric charges begin to redistribute. The transferred charges reach an equilibrium state as the separation distance increases to its highest point, corresponding to the maximized separation, as seen in (c)III. This results in a reversed current output, as shown in (c)IV. The V OC and I SC of KNNS-BF-3BNZ/PDMS composite films as a typical time-dependent difference of KNNS-BF-3BNZ contents, as shown in (a) and (b). The V OC and I SC of pure PDMS are 31 V and 0.39 \u03bcA, respectively. As the concentration of KNNS-BF-3BNZ increased up to 15 wt%, the V OC and I SC also increased, reaching a maximum value of 107 V and 4.68 \u03bcA, respectively. The combined properties of the hybrid piezoelectric and triboelectric effects can explain this increase in V OC and I SC. The piezoelectric effect originates from the ceramic powders of KNNS-BF-3BNZ, while the triboelectric effect results from the interaction between materials with different polarities, leading to electrification and electrostatic induction phenomena , in this case, the KNNS-BF-3BNZ/PDMS composite film and aluminum tape. At high concentrations of KNNS-BF-3BNZ (>15 wt%), the V OC and I SC continuously decreased. This decline is primarily due to excessive KNNS-BF-3BNZ disrupting the uniform dispersion within the PDMS matrix. When the concentration of KNNS-BF-3BNZ is too high, the particles tend to agglomerate, leading to uneven distribution. This poor dispersion can result in inadequate interaction between the ceramic particles and the PDMS matrix. To enable the practical application of the proposed hybrid PENG and TENG, the device must be connected to a diode bridge rectifier to convert the alternating current (AC) signals into direct current (DC). As shown in (c), the DC electrical output, including voltage, current, and power, of the KNNS-BF-3BNZ/PDMS composite film was measured across a range of external load resistances from 10E^{3} \u03a9 to 10E^{7} \u03a9. Consequently, the highest power calculated was approximately 1496 \xb5W at an external load resistance of 10E^{6} \u03a9, which is significantly higher than the power output from pure PDMS (8 \xb5W). (d) illustrates the performance characteristics of the hybrid PENG and TENG device when charging four different capacitors consisting of 0.22 \u03bcF, 0.33 \u03bcF, 2.2 \u03bcF, and 3.3 \u03bcF. The hybrid PENG and TENG in this study was able to achieve an output voltage of approximately 5 V within 6 seconds when charging the 0.22 \u03bcF capacitor, while the other capacitors were still in the process of charging. Furthermore, the self-powering test of KNNS-BF-3BNZ/PDMS composite films using the hybrid PENG and TENG is illustrated in (e)-(i). The device was connected to a diode bridge rectifier to convert alternating current (AC) signals into direct current (DC), as shown in (e) and (f). The hybrid PENG and TENG composite films effectively powered a watch ((g) and (h)) and 100 blue commercial LEDs during the pressing test, as depicted in (i). The results demonstrated that the electrical output from the KNNS-BF-3BNZ/PDMS device was sufficient to charge the capacitor and store energy. In conclusion, these results confirm the capability of the proposed hybrid PENG and TENG devices for use in self-powered energy systems and portable electronic devices.

At x=0 mol.%, three abnormal dielectric peaks were observed, corresponding to the R-O phase transition (T R-O= \u223c23\xb0C), the O-T phase transition (T O-T =152\xb0C) and the Curie temperature (T C=321\xb0C), respectively (as seen in (a)).

This indicates that the x(BNZ) content can improved both \u03b5 r and tan\u03b4 in the composition of x=0.03 mol.%. The P-E hysteresis loops of KNNS-BF-xBNZ ceramics at different x contents are shown in (e). They all exhibit a well-saturated P\u2013E hysteresis loop under an electric field of a 60 kV/cm. At x=0 mol.%, the value of P r, P s and E c are 13.7 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, 25.7 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} and 14.9 kV/cm, respectively. As x increased to 0.03 mol.%, the value of P r and P s increased from 13.7 to 18.8 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} and 25.7\u201330.3 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, respectively, while E c decreased. This increase in P r and P s can be attributed to the formation of a new MPB of R-T phase near room temperature , as confirmed by the XRD results. This behavior can be attributed to the ceramic primarily exhibiting a ferroelectric rhombohedral phase, consistent with the XRD results. The rhombohedral phase, characterized by high symmetry, is therefore responsible for the reduction in ferroelectricity observed in ceramics with x > 0.03 mol%. Additionally, a decrease in grain size in these samples may further hinder domain mobility , as evidenced by the FESEM results shown in (g). Consequently, this contributes to a weaker ferroelectric response in ceramics with x > 0.03 mol%. The d 33 of KNNS-BF-xBNZ ceramics at different x contents is illustrated in (d). The results indicate that the introduction of BNZ improves the piezoelectric properties. At x = 0 mol%, d 33 is approximately 293 pC/N. The value of d 33 initially increased, reaching a maximum of 358 pC/N at x = 0.03 mol%, which corresponds to a region near the rhombohedral-tetragonal (R\u2013T) phase boundary, before continuously decreasing, as depicted in (g). This observed maximum is higher than previous work, such as KNNS (d 33 = 120 pC/N) , and KNNS-0.03BNZ (d 33 = 257 pC/N). The increase in d 33 can be explained by the polarization rotation and enhanced domain wall motion near the R\u2013T phase boundary during poling , leading to improved piezoelectric properties. In the vicinity of the R\u2013T phase boundary, the co-existence of phases allows for easier reorientation of the polarization vector, thereby enhancing the electromechanical coupling. As a result, ceramics with a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) near room temperature exhibit significantly enhanced piezoelectric properties along with notable ferroelectric properties. However, the decrease in d 33 at higher x values can be attributed to the reduction in grain size and the increased presence of the rhombohedral structure, as observed in the FESEM and XRD analyses. To study energy harvesting properties, a sample with a composition of x=0.03 mol.% that demonstrates good electrical properties has been chosen to fabricate KNNS-BF-xBNZ/PDMS composite films. Hereafter, this sample will be referred to as KNNS-BF-3BNZ. The ceramic powders (KNNS-BF-3BNZ) were added to the PDMS matrix in ratios ranging from 0 to 30 wt%. The surface and cross-sectional morphology from FESEM-EDS of KNNS-BF-3BNZ/PDMS are shown in. The images indicate that pure PDMS has a smooth surface, as shown in (a), and a homogeneous cross-section, as depicted in (d). When EDS is performed on the surface of PDMS (spot 1), it reveals the presence of Si=40.9 %, C=37.8 %, and O=21.3 % ((g)). When KNNS-BF-3BNZ at 15 wt% is added to PDMS, the particles exhibit a clustered distribution within the PDMS matrix as seen in (b) and (e). EDS analysis of the first area (spot 2) shows the presence of elements from both PDMS and KNNS-BF-3BNZ with Si being the predominant component due to its high concentration of PDMS ((h)). In contrast, the analysis of the second area (spot 3) reveals a higher concentration of elements from KNNS-BF-3BNZ, with a lower amount of Si compared to spot 2 ((i)). The particles also exhibit a clustered distribution at a high concentration of KNNS-BF-3BNZ at 30 wt%. However, the particles become more apparent on the surface of the PDMS, indicating an excessive amount of KNNS-BF-3BNZ in the composite ((c)). (a)-(k) presents the EDS mapping analysis of KNNS-BF-3BNZ at 15 wt%. It shows that Si, C, and O are uniformly distributed across the sample, while Nb, Zr, Fe, Bi, Sb, Na, and K are found in clusters with some regions dispersed throughout the PDMS. These results confirm that KNNS-BF-3BNZ ceramic particles exhibit a clustered distribution within the PDMS matrix. The output voltage and current waveforms were recorded as V OC and I SC, respectively, under controlled relative humidity (RH) of 48.5 \xb1 5 % during the contact-separation process. An automatic compressing machine (ACM) operated vertically at a frequency of 10 Hz. The results for the KNNS-BF-3BNZ/PDMS composite films prepared using the PENG, TENG, and hybrid PENG-TENG methods are illustrated in (a) and (b). The PENG method produced a maximum V OC of 9 V, while the TENG method demonstrated a V OC of 33 V. The hybrid PENG-TENG method achieved the highest V OC of 107 V, indicating a synergistic enhancement in voltage output, as shown in (a). (b) presents the I SC values for the same composite films. The PENG method exhibits a maximum I SC of 0.23 \u03bcA, whereas the TENG method shows an I SC of 0.39 \u03bcA. The hybrid PENG and TENG approach achieves the highest ISC of 4.68 \u03bcA, reflecting the combined effect of both piezoelectric and triboelectric mechanisms. These results indicate that the hybrid PENG and TENG method significantly enhances both the V OC and I SC values compared to the individual PENG and TENG methods, making it a promising approach for improving the performance of energy harvesting devices. The mechanism of the hybrid PENG and TENG operates as follows, see in (c). When the KNNS-BF-3BNZ/PDMS composite film and the aluminum electrode are pressed together, electrons are transferred from one material to another due to differences in their triboelectric properties, creating a triboelectric charge. In the releasing state ((c)II), the mechanical deformation of the piezoelectric material is reduced, and the triboelectric charges begin to redistribute. The transferred charges reach an equilibrium state as the separation distance increases to its highest point, corresponding to the maximized separation, as seen in (c)III. This results in a reversed current output, as shown in (c)IV. The V OC and I SC of KNNS-BF-3BNZ/PDMS composite films as a typical time-dependent difference of KNNS-BF-3BNZ contents, as shown in (a) and (b). The V OC and I SC of pure PDMS are 31 V and 0.39 \u03bcA, respectively. As the concentration of KNNS-BF-3BNZ increased up to 15 wt%, the V OC and I SC also increased, reaching a maximum value of 107 V and 4.68 \u03bcA, respectively. The combined properties of the hybrid piezoelectric and triboelectric effects can explain this increase in V OC and I SC. The piezoelectric effect originates from the ceramic powders of KNNS-BF-3BNZ, while the triboelectric effect results from the interaction between materials with different polarities, leading to electrification and electrostatic induction phenomena , in this case, the KNNS-BF-3BNZ/PDMS composite film and aluminum tape. At high concentrations of KNNS-BF-3BNZ (>15 wt%), the V OC and I SC continuously decreased. This decline is primarily due to excessive KNNS-BF-3BNZ disrupting the uniform dispersion within the PDMS matrix. When the concentration of KNNS-BF-3BNZ is too high, the particles tend to agglomerate, leading to uneven distribution. This poor dispersion can result in inadequate interaction between the ceramic particles and the PDMS matrix. To enable the practical application of the proposed hybrid PENG and TENG, the device must be connected to a diode bridge rectifier to convert the alternating current (AC) signals into direct current (DC). As shown in (c), the DC electrical output, including voltage, current, and power, of the KNNS-BF-3BNZ/PDMS composite film was measured across a range of external load resistances from 10E^{3} \u03a9 to 10E^{7} \u03a9. Consequently, the highest power calculated was approximately 1496 \xb5W at an external load resistance of 10E^{6} \u03a9, which is significantly higher than the power output from pure PDMS (8 \xb5W). (d) illustrates the performance characteristics of the hybrid PENG and TENG device when charging four different capacitors consisting of 0.22 \u03bcF, 0.33 \u03bcF, 2.2 \u03bcF, and 3.3 \u03bcF. The hybrid PENG and TENG in this study was able to achieve an output voltage of approximately 5 V within 6 seconds when charging the 0.22 \u03bcF capacitor, while the other capacitors were still in the process of charging. Furthermore, the self-powering test of KNNS-BF-3BNZ/PDMS composite films using the hybrid PENG and TENG is illustrated in (e)-(i). The device was connected to a diode bridge rectifier to convert alternating current (AC) signals into direct current (DC), as shown in (e) and (f). The hybrid PENG and TENG composite films effectively powered a watch ((g) and (h)) and 100 blue commercial LEDs during the pressing test, as depicted in (i). The results demonstrated that the electrical output from the KNNS-BF-3BNZ/PDMS device was sufficient to charge the capacitor and store energy. In conclusion, these results confirm the capability of the proposed hybrid PENG and TENG devices for use in self-powered energy systems and portable electronic devices.
