# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Previous studies have shown that the PMS-PZT ternary system has excellent comprehensive properties with high Q m and k p values simultaneously, high stability, and low dielectric loss. Its MPB is around component Ti = 0.52 in composition. a is the phase diagram of the PMS-PZT ternary system, where the red circles represent the xPMS-(1-x)PZT ceramics studied in this work (x=0.07\u20130.085). The XRD patterns of PMS-PZT ceramics are shown in b. The results show that all the samples are pure perovskite structure without the formation of secondary phase, forming a complete solid solution. c shows the enlarged XRD image in the range of 43\u201346 \xb0, and it is clear that all components are located at the MPB, where the rhombohedral and the tetragonal phases coexist. Piezoelectric ceramics located at the MPB typically show better piezoelectric properties. Piezoelectric ceramics without the MPB require a large amount of energy to promote phase transition, while piezoelectric ceramics with the MPB have the lower free energy potential energy barrier because of the coexistence of multiple phases. Therefore, piezoelectric ceramics located at the MPB usually show high dielectric and piezoelectric properties. Gaussian fitting was used to separate the multi-peaks into three single peaks, including the (200) peak and (002) peak of the T phase, and the (200) peak of the R phase. The percentage of tetragonal fraction can be calculated by the following equation : Where I T(200), I T(002) and I R(200) represent the integrated areas of diffraction peaks (200)T, (002)T, and (200)R, respectively. The volume percentages of the tetragonal phase of the four components are 82, 84, 80 and 79 %, respectively. (a-d) show the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of xPMS-(1-x)PZT ceramics. Additionally, the density of PMS\u2013PZT ceramics ranges from 7.8 g/mE^{3} to 7.9 g/mE^{3}, indicating that the addition of PMS can facilitate the sintering process and promote densification. The grain size increases with the increase of PMS content, indicating that the SbE^{5+} or MnE^{2+} ions have a promotion effect on the grain growth. According to the sintering kinetics of PZT-based ceramics, boundary roughness is positively correlated with grain growth. As the PMS content increases, an increased amount of Sb and Mn may accumulate at the grain boundaries, thereby enhancing the boundary roughness of the ceramics. As a result, the average grain size (D ave) of PMS-PZT ceramics increase from 3.51 \u03bcm to 4.17 \u03bcm calculated by the statistical method. (a-d) depict the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) and loss (tan\u03b4) for the PMS-PZT ceramics measured at different frequencies. It is found that the temperature of maximum \u03b5r have changed with the increase of frequency, indicating that they are relaxor ferroelectric rather than normal ferroelectric ceramics. \u0394Tm is typically used to represent the frequency dispersion of ferroelectrics:  Tm, 1 kHz and Tm, 100 kHz are the temperatures corresponding to the maximum dielectric constant at 1 kHz and 100 kHz, respectively. For xPMS-(1-x)PZT ceramics, the \u0394Tm values are 0, 2, 4, and 9 \u2103 respectively when x is in the range of 0.07\u20130.085, indicating that the dispersion behavior of the ceramics is enhanced with the increase of PMS content. e depicts the \u03b5 r and tan\u03b4 for the PMS-PZT ceramics measured at 1 kHz. As the PMS content increases, the Curie temperature (T c) of the samples gradually decreases from 305 \u2103 to 283 \u2103, as shown in f, indicating that SbE^{5+} and MnE^{2+} ions enter the lattice of the material and influence the stability of ferroelectric phase. Moreover, f also shows the \u03b5 r of the ceramics at room temperature. It was reported that domain clamping due to the reduced grain size is a reason responsible for the low dielectric constant , this may explain the increasing of \u03b5 r at room temperature with the increased PMS doping content. (a-b) show the P-E and I-E loops of unpolarized PMS-PZT ceramics at room temperature and 10 Hz. As shown in the a, all the ceramics present constriction behavior in the loops, exhibiting a \u201cgirdling\u201d-type shape, which is a typical feature of hard piezoelectric materials. MnE^{2+} ions acting as acceptor doping ion replace TiE^{4+} and ZrE^{4+} at the B-site, forming acceptor center \uff08Mn Zr,Ti \u2032\u2032\uff09. The acceptor center binds with oxygen vacancies to form defect dipoles( Mn Zr,Ti \u2032\u2032\u2212 V O \u2032\u2032), maintaining the same direction as the spontaneous polarization (P s) and have a pinning effect on ceramics, which can pin the ferroelectric domains to maintain a stable state. The P1 current peak under high electric field reveals the coercive field (E c) of hard piezoelectric ceramics, which is related to the turning of ferroelectric domains. The P2 current peak under low electric field is related to the depolarization of turning ferroelectric domains under the recovery force of defect dipoles. The abnormal P3 current peak corresponds to the point defects that existed during sintering process. With the increase of PMS content, as shown in c, the E c decreases from 30.3 kV/cm to 28.4 kV/cm, while the P r and the intensity of the P1 current peak increase, indicating the increased number of switchable P s. lists the comprehensive electrical properties of PMS-PZT ceramics. The variation of piezoelectric coefficient d 33 and mechanical quality factor Q m with PMS content is shown in (a). It can be seen that the Q m and d 33 increase firstly and then decrease as the PMS content increases. Generally, Q m and d33 show an obvious mutual restraint relationship , but there is no restrictive relationship between Q m and d 33 in the PMS-PZT system. The high piezoelectric constant observed here is attributed to the phase structure of MPB, while the slight decrease in Q m and d 33 may be due to the excessive increase in oxygen vacancies, which generate defect dipoles of other configurations accumulating near domain walls and grain boundaries. In addition, excessive oxygen vacancy defects usually lead to enhanced conductivity and an increase in tan\u03b4, which is mostly observed in Mn-doped PZT based ceramics. To further evaluate the comprehensive performance of the PMS-PZT ceramics, the figure of merit (FOM), defined as Q m \xd7d 33 \xd7 E C, is introduced. The value of d 33 \xd7 E C could represents the strain of the samples under the action of an external electric field on the basis of the characteristics of piezoelectric materials , and the Q m is a vital parameter in high-power piezoelectric ceramics. Therefore, FOM value in (b) could indicate the application potential of the material in high-power piezoelectric devices. (c) compares the d 33 \xd7 E C and Q m of the 0.075PMS-0.925PZT samples with some literature or commercial results, from which we can see that our work has got excellent electrical performance of ceramics. The optimum property is found at the composition of x=0.075, with Q m=1595, k p=0.61, d 33=318 pC/N, tan\u03b4=0.6 %, which shows that the ceramics in this work has great potential in high-power piezoelectric applications. In order to systematically study the temperature characteristics of the x=0.075 ceramic, we measure its parameters under different temperatures in the following study. The temperature coefficients of the piezoelectric properties were measured in the temperature range from room temperature to 175 \u2103 due to the fact that the actual operating temperature of piezoelectric materials is generally half of the T c. (a-b) show the impedance and phase angle \u03c6 as functions of frequency for x=0.075 ceramic. The frequency bandwidth \u2206f (\u2206f=f a-f r) slightly decreases from 20 kHz to 17 kHz while the relative bandwidth decreases from 14.8 % to 12.3 %. In the radial vibration mode of thin circular plates, the relative bandwidth is generally between 1.6 % and 15 %. Therefore, this material has a large relative bandwidth and could be applied in frequency devices such as filter. c shows the variation of the elastic compliance coefficient S 11 E for the x=0.075 ceramic over the temperature range from 0 \u2103 to 175 \u2103. As the temperature increases, the pinning effect of defect dipoles on domains weaken and the entire grain movement caused by non-180\xb0 domain wall motion generates elastic deformation in the ceramics, which form a stress field inside the ceramic and reduce the S 11 E. The resonant frequency is calculated by the following equation : Where \u03d5 is diameter of the ceramic, \u03c3 is Poisson's ratio, \u03c1 is density of the ceramic, B is the root of the Bessel function, which is positively correlated with the Poisson's ratio. When the external temperature increases, the Poisson's ratio increases and the S 11 E decreases. The non-resonant frequency of the sample does not shift because of the strong domain clamping effect, making it useful for some devices working at non-resonant frequency such as non-resonant piezoelectric actuators. b shows that the phase angle \u03c6 of the x=0.075 ceramic is about 90\xb0 at room temperature, indicating that it has low mechanical loss and is fully poled. It also can be seen that the \u03c6 slightly decreases from 90\xb0 to 88\xb0 when the temperature increases from 25\u2103 to 175 \u2103. d shows the variation of temperature coefficients with external temperature changes. It can be seen that the \u2206f r/f r 25\u2103 is 2.2 % and the \u2206k p/k p 25\u2103 is 8.7 %, indicating that the 0.075PMS-0.925PZT ceramic has good temperature stability. Previous studies have reported that T-phase dominated piezoelectric ceramics exhibit good temperature stability because of the existence of short and broad electric domains. e shows AFM phase diagram of the sample, from which we can see the short and broad striped domains with random arrangement. The Q m and \u03b5r as a function of temperature for x=0.075 ceramic is shown in f, the Q m of the sample is higher than 600 at 175\u2103 while the \u03b5 r increases from 1064 to 1781, satisfying the application requirements at high temperature. As we all know, the temperature-dependent saturated P-E loops were conducted to determine the thermal reliability of piezoelectricity due to the reorientation of ferroelectric dipoles. (a-b) shows the P-E loops and I-E loops of the x=0.075 ceramic measured from 25 \u2103 to 175 \u2103. It can be found that the P r increases from 4.3 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} to 10.0 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} while the E c decreases from 30.1 kV/cm to 16.0 kV/cm monotonously when the temperature rises from 25 \u2103 to 175 \u2103. Moreover, the temperature dependence of internal bias field E i for the x=0.075 ceramics is shown in c. It can be seen that the E i decreases from 3.6 kV/cm to 2.5 kV/cm.

# ABSTRACT
Lead-based Pb(Zr, Ti)O3 ceramics have been widely used in high-power piezoelectric applications, but its stable operation at high temperature is still a grand challenge. In this work, the third element Pb(Mn1/3Sb2/3)O3 (PMS) was incorporated into Pb(Zr0.48Ti0.52)O3 (PZT) to design the xPb(Mn1/3Sb2/3)O3-(1-x)Pb(Zr0.48Ti0.52)O3 (PMS-PZT) ternary ceramics through the phase diagram.

Moreover, the T-phase dominated 0.075PMS-0.925PZT ceramic obtains great temperature stability with a low variation of resonant frequency below 2.2â¯% and no variation of non-resonant frequency in the temperature range from 25Â°C to 175Â°C.

# INTRODUCTION
Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) piezoelectric ceramics have been widely used in electronic devices such as piezoelectric actuators, piezoelectric transformers, and ultrasonic transducers due to their excellent piezoelectric properties and stability. By introducing lead vacancy defects and oxygen vacancy defects into perovskite structures, the piezoelectric constant (d 33) and quality factor (Q m) of piezoelectric ceramics can be improved in a targeted manner. PMS-PZT is a ternary piezoelectric ceramic of ABO3-type perovskite in which SbE^{5+}/MnE^{2+} ions replace ZrE^{4+}/TiE^{4+} ions at the B site. As a result, the properties of PZT ceramics can be effectively improved by incorporating PMS. It was reported that the PMS-PZT ceramic near morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) could show both high Q m and k p at the same time, which is one of the most suitable piezoelectric materials for high power application. PMS-PZT ceramics doped with 2 mol% Yb have been turned out to be a great high-power piezoelectric material, and its safety vibration velocity can reach 1100 mm/s. Wu et al. reported that Pb0.98Sr0.02(Mn1/3Sb2/3)0.05Zr0.48Ti0.47O3 doped with 0.25 wt% CeO2\u30010.50 wt% Yb2O3 and 0.15 wt% Fe2O3 obtained the optimal properties with d 33 = 360 pC/N, Q m= 1500, k p = 0.6, and tan\u03b4 = 2.8 %. In this work, in order to synthesize high-power piezoelectric ceramics with high Q m and good temperature stability, we prepared a series of xPb (Mn1/3Sb2/3) O3-(1-x) Pb (Zr0.48Ti0.52) O3 ceramics near the MPB, with x=0.07, 0.075, 0.08 and 0.085.

# CONCLUSION
In summary, through intentionally designing component by the phase diagram of the PMS-PZT ternary systems, xPMS-(1-x)PZT ceramics were fabricated by the traditional solid-state reaction method. The sample with x=0.075 shows excellent piezoelectric properties as follows, Q m=1595, k p=0.61, d 33=318 pC/N, tan\u03b4=0.60 %, which are attributed to both it\u2019s morphotropic phase boundary structure and the pinning effect of defect dipoles on domain rotation. Moreover, the T-phase dominated 0.075PMS-0.925PZT ceramic obtains great temperature stability with \u2206f r/f r 25\u2103=2.2 % and \u2206k p/k p 25\u2103=8.7 % because of the existence of the short and broad striped domains.

With the increase of PMS content, as shown in c, the E c decreases from 30.3 kV/cm to 28.4 kV/cm, while the P r and the intensity of the P1 current peak increase, indicating the increased number of switchable P s. lists the comprehensive electrical properties of PMS-PZT ceramics. The variation of piezoelectric coefficient d 33 and mechanical quality factor Q m with PMS content is shown in (a). It can be seen that the Q m and d 33 increase firstly and then decrease as the PMS content increases. Generally, Q m and d33 show an obvious mutual restraint relationship , but there is no restrictive relationship between Q m and d 33 in the PMS-PZT system. The high piezoelectric constant observed here is attributed to the phase structure of MPB, while the slight decrease in Q m and d 33 may be due to the excessive increase in oxygen vacancies, which generate defect dipoles of other configurations accumulating near domain walls and grain boundaries. In addition, excessive oxygen vacancy defects usually lead to enhanced conductivity and an increase in tan\u03b4, which is mostly observed in Mn-doped PZT based ceramics. To further evaluate the comprehensive performance of the PMS-PZT ceramics, the figure of merit (FOM), defined as Q m \xd7d 33 \xd7 E C, is introduced. The value of d 33 \xd7 E C could represents the strain of the samples under the action of an external electric field on the basis of the characteristics of piezoelectric materials , and the Q m is a vital parameter in high-power piezoelectric ceramics. Therefore, FOM value in (b) could indicate the application potential of the material in high-power piezoelectric devices. (c) compares the d 33 \xd7 E C and Q m of the 0.075PMS-0.925PZT samples with some literature or commercial results, from which we can see that our work has got excellent electrical performance of ceramics. The optimum property is found at the composition of x=0.075, with Q m=1595, k p=0.61, d 33=318 pC/N, tan\u03b4=0.6 %, which shows that the ceramics in this work has great potential in high-power piezoelectric applications. In order to systematically study the temperature characteristics of the x=0.075 ceramic, we measure its parameters under different temperatures in the following study. The temperature coefficients of the piezoelectric properties were measured in the temperature range from room temperature to 175 \u2103 due to the fact that the actual operating temperature of piezoelectric materials is generally half of the T c.

The frequency bandwidth \u2206f (\u2206f=f a-f r) slightly decreases from 20 kHz to 17 kHz while the relative bandwidth decreases from 14.8 % to 12.3 %. In the radial vibration mode of thin circular plates, the relative bandwidth is generally between 1.6 % and 15 %. Therefore, this material has a large relative bandwidth and could be applied in frequency devices such as filter. c shows the variation of the elastic compliance coefficient S 11 E for the x=0.075 ceramic over the temperature range from 0 \u2103 to 175 \u2103. As the temperature increases, the pinning effect of defect dipoles on domains weaken and the entire grain movement caused by non-180\xb0 domain wall motion generates elastic deformation in the ceramics, which form a stress field inside the ceramic and reduce the S 11 E. The resonant frequency is calculated by the following equation : Where \u03d5 is diameter of the ceramic, \u03c3 is Poisson's ratio, \u03c1 is density of the ceramic, B is the root of the Bessel function, which is positively correlated with the Poisson's ratio. When the external temperature increases, the Poisson's ratio increases and the S 11 E decreases. The non-resonant frequency of the sample does not shift because of the strong domain clamping effect, making it useful for some devices working at non-resonant frequency such as non-resonant piezoelectric actuators. b shows that the phase angle \u03c6 of the x=0.075 ceramic is about 90\xb0 at room temperature, indicating that it has low mechanical loss and is fully poled.

It can be seen that the \u2206f r/f r 25\u2103 is 2.2 % and the \u2206k p/k p 25\u2103 is 8.7 %, indicating that the 0.075PMS-0.925PZT ceramic has good temperature stability.

Moreover, the temperature dependence of internal bias field E i for the x=0.075 ceramics is shown in c. It can be seen that the E i decreases from 3.6 kV/cm to 2.5 kV/cm.

# INTRODUCTION
Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) piezoelectric ceramics have been widely used in electronic devices such as piezoelectric actuators, piezoelectric transformers, and ultrasonic transducers due to their excellent piezoelectric properties and stability. By introducing lead vacancy defects and oxygen vacancy defects into perovskite structures, the piezoelectric constant (d 33) and quality factor (Q m) of piezoelectric ceramics can be improved in a targeted manner. PMS-PZT is a ternary piezoelectric ceramic of ABO3-type perovskite in which SbE^{5+}/MnE^{2+} ions replace ZrE^{4+}/TiE^{4+} ions at the B site. As a result, the properties of PZT ceramics can be effectively improved by incorporating PMS. It was reported that the PMS-PZT ceramic near morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) could show both high Q m and k p at the same time, which is one of the most suitable piezoelectric materials for high power application. PMS-PZT ceramics doped with 2 mol% Yb have been turned out to be a great high-power piezoelectric material, and its safety vibration velocity can reach 1100 mm/s. Wu et al. reported that Pb0.98Sr0.02(Mn1/3Sb2/3)0.05Zr0.48Ti0.47O3 doped with 0.25 wt% CeO2\u30010.50 wt% Yb2O3 and 0.15 wt% Fe2O3 obtained the optimal properties with d 33 = 360 pC/N, Q m= 1500, k p = 0.6, and tan\u03b4 = 2.8 %. In this work, in order to synthesize high-power piezoelectric ceramics with high Q m and good temperature stability, we prepared a series of xPb (Mn1/3Sb2/3) O3-(1-x) Pb (Zr0.48Ti0.52) O3 ceramics near the MPB, with x=0.07, 0.075, 0.08 and 0.085.

# CONCLUSION
In summary, through intentionally designing component by the phase diagram of the PMS-PZT ternary systems, xPMS-(1-x)PZT ceramics were fabricated by the traditional solid-state reaction method. The sample with x=0.075 shows excellent piezoelectric properties as follows, Q m=1595, k p=0.61, d 33=318 pC/N, tan\u03b4=0.60 %, which are attributed to both it\u2019s morphotropic phase boundary structure and the pinning effect of defect dipoles on domain rotation. Moreover, the T-phase dominated 0.075PMS-0.925PZT ceramic obtains great temperature stability with \u2206f r/f r 25\u2103=2.2 % and \u2206k p/k p 25\u2103=8.7 % because of the existence of the short and broad striped domains.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Previous studies have shown that the PMS-PZT ternary system has excellent comprehensive properties with high Q m and k p values simultaneously, high stability, and low dielectric loss. Its MPB is around component Ti = 0.52 in composition. a is the phase diagram of the PMS-PZT ternary system, where the red circles represent the xPMS-(1-x)PZT ceramics studied in this work (x=0.07\u20130.085). The XRD patterns of PMS-PZT ceramics are shown in b. The results show that all the samples are pure perovskite structure without the formation of secondary phase, forming a complete solid solution. c shows the enlarged XRD image in the range of 43\u201346 \xb0, and it is clear that all components are located at the MPB, where the rhombohedral and the tetragonal phases coexist. Piezoelectric ceramics located at the MPB typically show better piezoelectric properties. Piezoelectric ceramics without the MPB require a large amount of energy to promote phase transition, while piezoelectric ceramics with the MPB have the lower free energy potential energy barrier because of the coexistence of multiple phases. Therefore, piezoelectric ceramics located at the MPB usually show high dielectric and piezoelectric properties. Gaussian fitting was used to separate the multi-peaks into three single peaks, including the (200) peak and (002) peak of the T phase, and the (200) peak of the R phase. The percentage of tetragonal fraction can be calculated by the following equation : Where I T(200), I T(002) and I R(200) represent the integrated areas of diffraction peaks (200)T, (002)T, and (200)R, respectively. The volume percentages of the tetragonal phase of the four components are 82, 84, 80 and 79 %, respectively. (a-d) show the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of xPMS-(1-x)PZT ceramics. Additionally, the density of PMS\u2013PZT ceramics ranges from 7.8 g/mE^{3} to 7.9 g/mE^{3}, indicating that the addition of PMS can facilitate the sintering process and promote densification. The grain size increases with the increase of PMS content, indicating that the SbE^{5+} or MnE^{2+} ions have a promotion effect on the grain growth. According to the sintering kinetics of PZT-based ceramics, boundary roughness is positively correlated with grain growth. As the PMS content increases, an increased amount of Sb and Mn may accumulate at the grain boundaries, thereby enhancing the boundary roughness of the ceramics. As a result, the average grain size (D ave) of PMS-PZT ceramics increase from 3.51 \u03bcm to 4.17 \u03bcm calculated by the statistical method. (a-d) depict the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) and loss (tan\u03b4) for the PMS-PZT ceramics measured at different frequencies. It is found that the temperature of maximum \u03b5r have changed with the increase of frequency, indicating that they are relaxor ferroelectric rather than normal ferroelectric ceramics. \u0394Tm is typically used to represent the frequency dispersion of ferroelectrics:  Tm, 1 kHz and Tm, 100 kHz are the temperatures corresponding to the maximum dielectric constant at 1 kHz and 100 kHz, respectively. For xPMS-(1-x)PZT ceramics, the \u0394Tm values are 0, 2, 4, and 9 \u2103 respectively when x is in the range of 0.07\u20130.085, indicating that the dispersion behavior of the ceramics is enhanced with the increase of PMS content. e depicts the \u03b5 r and tan\u03b4 for the PMS-PZT ceramics measured at 1 kHz. As the PMS content increases, the Curie temperature (T c) of the samples gradually decreases from 305 \u2103 to 283 \u2103, as shown in f, indicating that SbE^{5+} and MnE^{2+} ions enter the lattice of the material and influence the stability of ferroelectric phase. Moreover, f also shows the \u03b5 r of the ceramics at room temperature. It was reported that domain clamping due to the reduced grain size is a reason responsible for the low dielectric constant , this may explain the increasing of \u03b5 r at room temperature with the increased PMS doping content. (a-b) show the P-E and I-E loops of unpolarized PMS-PZT ceramics at room temperature and 10 Hz. As shown in the a, all the ceramics present constriction behavior in the loops, exhibiting a \u201cgirdling\u201d-type shape, which is a typical feature of hard piezoelectric materials. MnE^{2+} ions acting as acceptor doping ion replace TiE^{4+} and ZrE^{4+} at the B-site, forming acceptor center \uff08Mn Zr,Ti \u2032\u2032\uff09. The acceptor center binds with oxygen vacancies to form defect dipoles( Mn Zr,Ti \u2032\u2032\u2212 V O \u2032\u2032), maintaining the same direction as the spontaneous polarization (P s) and have a pinning effect on ceramics, which can pin the ferroelectric domains to maintain a stable state. The P1 current peak under high electric field reveals the coercive field (E c) of hard piezoelectric ceramics, which is related to the turning of ferroelectric domains. The P2 current peak under low electric field is related to the depolarization of turning ferroelectric domains under the recovery force of defect dipoles. The abnormal P3 current peak corresponds to the point defects that existed during sintering process. With the increase of PMS content, as shown in c, the E c decreases from 30.3 kV/cm to 28.4 kV/cm, while the P r and the intensity of the P1 current peak increase, indicating the increased number of switchable P s. lists the comprehensive electrical properties of PMS-PZT ceramics. The variation of piezoelectric coefficient d 33 and mechanical quality factor Q m with PMS content is shown in (a). It can be seen that the Q m and d 33 increase firstly and then decrease as the PMS content increases. Generally, Q m and d33 show an obvious mutual restraint relationship , but there is no restrictive relationship between Q m and d 33 in the PMS-PZT system. The high piezoelectric constant observed here is attributed to the phase structure of MPB, while the slight decrease in Q m and d 33 may be due to the excessive increase in oxygen vacancies, which generate defect dipoles of other configurations accumulating near domain walls and grain boundaries. In addition, excessive oxygen vacancy defects usually lead to enhanced conductivity and an increase in tan\u03b4, which is mostly observed in Mn-doped PZT based ceramics. To further evaluate the comprehensive performance of the PMS-PZT ceramics, the figure of merit (FOM), defined as Q m \xd7d 33 \xd7 E C, is introduced. The value of d 33 \xd7 E C could represents the strain of the samples under the action of an external electric field on the basis of the characteristics of piezoelectric materials , and the Q m is a vital parameter in high-power piezoelectric ceramics. Therefore, FOM value in (b) could indicate the application potential of the material in high-power piezoelectric devices. (c) compares the d 33 \xd7 E C and Q m of the 0.075PMS-0.925PZT samples with some literature or commercial results, from which we can see that our work has got excellent electrical performance of ceramics. The optimum property is found at the composition of x=0.075, with Q m=1595, k p=0.61, d 33=318 pC/N, tan\u03b4=0.6 %, which shows that the ceramics in this work has great potential in high-power piezoelectric applications. In order to systematically study the temperature characteristics of the x=0.075 ceramic, we measure its parameters under different temperatures in the following study.

As a result, the properties of PZT ceramics can be effectively improved by incorporating PMS. It was reported that the PMS-PZT ceramic near morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) could show both high Q m and k p at the same time, which is one of the most suitable piezoelectric materials for high power application. PMS-PZT ceramics doped with 2 mol% Yb have been turned out to be a great high-power piezoelectric material, and its safety vibration velocity can reach 1100 mm/s. Wu et al. reported that Pb0.98Sr0.02(Mn1/3Sb2/3)0.05Zr0.48Ti0.47O3 doped with 0.25 wt% CeO2\u30010.50 wt% Yb2O3 and 0.15 wt% Fe2O3 obtained the optimal properties with d 33 = 360 pC/N, Q m= 1500, k p = 0.6, and tan\u03b4 = 2.8 %. In this work, in order to synthesize high-power piezoelectric ceramics with high Q m and good temperature stability, we prepared a series of xPb (Mn1/3Sb2/3) O3-(1-x) Pb (Zr0.48Ti0.52) O3 ceramics near the MPB, with x=0.07, 0.075, 0.08 and 0.085.

# CONCLUSION
In summary, through intentionally designing component by the phase diagram of the PMS-PZT ternary systems, xPMS-(1-x)PZT ceramics were fabricated by the traditional solid-state reaction method. The sample with x=0.075 shows excellent piezoelectric properties as follows, Q m=1595, k p=0.61, d 33=318 pC/N, tan\u03b4=0.60 %, which are attributed to both it\u2019s morphotropic phase boundary structure and the pinning effect of defect dipoles on domain rotation. Moreover, the T-phase dominated 0.075PMS-0.925PZT ceramic obtains great temperature stability with \u2206f r/f r 25\u2103=2.2 % and \u2206k p/k p 25\u2103=8.7 % because of the existence of the short and broad striped domains.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Previous studies have shown that the PMS-PZT ternary system has excellent comprehensive properties with high Q m and k p values simultaneously, high stability, and low dielectric loss. Its MPB is around component Ti = 0.52 in composition. a is the phase diagram of the PMS-PZT ternary system, where the red circles represent the xPMS-(1-x)PZT ceramics studied in this work (x=0.07\u20130.085). The XRD patterns of PMS-PZT ceramics are shown in b. The results show that all the samples are pure perovskite structure without the formation of secondary phase, forming a complete solid solution. c shows the enlarged XRD image in the range of 43\u201346 \xb0, and it is clear that all components are located at the MPB, where the rhombohedral and the tetragonal phases coexist. Piezoelectric ceramics located at the MPB typically show better piezoelectric properties. Piezoelectric ceramics without the MPB require a large amount of energy to promote phase transition, while piezoelectric ceramics with the MPB have the lower free energy potential energy barrier because of the coexistence of multiple phases. Therefore, piezoelectric ceramics located at the MPB usually show high dielectric and piezoelectric properties. Gaussian fitting was used to separate the multi-peaks into three single peaks, including the (200) peak and (002) peak of the T phase, and the (200) peak of the R phase. The percentage of tetragonal fraction can be calculated by the following equation : Where I T(200), I T(002) and I R(200) represent the integrated areas of diffraction peaks (200)T, (002)T, and (200)R, respectively. The volume percentages of the tetragonal phase of the four components are 82, 84, 80 and 79 %, respectively. (a-d) show the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of xPMS-(1-x)PZT ceramics. Additionally, the density of PMS\u2013PZT ceramics ranges from 7.8 g/mE^{3} to 7.9 g/mE^{3}, indicating that the addition of PMS can facilitate the sintering process and promote densification. The grain size increases with the increase of PMS content, indicating that the SbE^{5+} or MnE^{2+} ions have a promotion effect on the grain growth. According to the sintering kinetics of PZT-based ceramics, boundary roughness is positively correlated with grain growth. As the PMS content increases, an increased amount of Sb and Mn may accumulate at the grain boundaries, thereby enhancing the boundary roughness of the ceramics. As a result, the average grain size (D ave) of PMS-PZT ceramics increase from 3.51 \u03bcm to 4.17 \u03bcm calculated by the statistical method. (a-d) depict the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) and loss (tan\u03b4) for the PMS-PZT ceramics measured at different frequencies. It is found that the temperature of maximum \u03b5r have changed with the increase of frequency, indicating that they are relaxor ferroelectric rather than normal ferroelectric ceramics. \u0394Tm is typically used to represent the frequency dispersion of ferroelectrics:  Tm, 1 kHz and Tm, 100 kHz are the temperatures corresponding to the maximum dielectric constant at 1 kHz and 100 kHz, respectively. For xPMS-(1-x)PZT ceramics, the \u0394Tm values are 0, 2, 4, and 9 \u2103 respectively when x is in the range of 0.07\u20130.085, indicating that the dispersion behavior of the ceramics is enhanced with the increase of PMS content. e depicts the \u03b5 r and tan\u03b4 for the PMS-PZT ceramics measured at 1 kHz. As the PMS content increases, the Curie temperature (T c) of the samples gradually decreases from 305 \u2103 to 283 \u2103, as shown in f, indicating that SbE^{5+} and MnE^{2+} ions enter the lattice of the material and influence the stability of ferroelectric phase. Moreover, f also shows the \u03b5 r of the ceramics at room temperature. It was reported that domain clamping due to the reduced grain size is a reason responsible for the low dielectric constant , this may explain the increasing of \u03b5 r at room temperature with the increased PMS doping content. (a-b) show the P-E and I-E loops of unpolarized PMS-PZT ceramics at room temperature and 10 Hz. As shown in the a, all the ceramics present constriction behavior in the loops, exhibiting a \u201cgirdling\u201d-type shape, which is a typical feature of hard piezoelectric materials. MnE^{2+} ions acting as acceptor doping ion replace TiE^{4+} and ZrE^{4+} at the B-site, forming acceptor center \uff08Mn Zr,Ti \u2032\u2032\uff09. The acceptor center binds with oxygen vacancies to form defect dipoles( Mn Zr,Ti \u2032\u2032\u2212 V O \u2032\u2032), maintaining the same direction as the spontaneous polarization (P s) and have a pinning effect on ceramics, which can pin the ferroelectric domains to maintain a stable state. The P1 current peak under high electric field reveals the coercive field (E c) of hard piezoelectric ceramics, which is related to the turning of ferroelectric domains. The P2 current peak under low electric field is related to the depolarization of turning ferroelectric domains under the recovery force of defect dipoles. The abnormal P3 current peak corresponds to the point defects that existed during sintering process. With the increase of PMS content, as shown in c, the E c decreases from 30.3 kV/cm to 28.4 kV/cm, while the P r and the intensity of the P1 current peak increase, indicating the increased number of switchable P s. lists the comprehensive electrical properties of PMS-PZT ceramics. The variation of piezoelectric coefficient d 33 and mechanical quality factor Q m with PMS content is shown in (a). It can be seen that the Q m and d 33 increase firstly and then decrease as the PMS content increases. Generally, Q m and d33 show an obvious mutual restraint relationship , but there is no restrictive relationship between Q m and d 33 in the PMS-PZT system. The high piezoelectric constant observed here is attributed to the phase structure of MPB, while the slight decrease in Q m and d 33 may be due to the excessive increase in oxygen vacancies, which generate defect dipoles of other configurations accumulating near domain walls and grain boundaries. In addition, excessive oxygen vacancy defects usually lead to enhanced conductivity and an increase in tan\u03b4, which is mostly observed in Mn-doped PZT based ceramics. To further evaluate the comprehensive performance of the PMS-PZT ceramics, the figure of merit (FOM), defined as Q m \xd7d 33 \xd7 E C, is introduced. The value of d 33 \xd7 E C could represents the strain of the samples under the action of an external electric field on the basis of the characteristics of piezoelectric materials , and the Q m is a vital parameter in high-power piezoelectric ceramics. Therefore, FOM value in (b) could indicate the application potential of the material in high-power piezoelectric devices. (c) compares the d 33 \xd7 E C and Q m of the 0.075PMS-0.925PZT samples with some literature or commercial results, from which we can see that our work has got excellent electrical performance of ceramics. The optimum property is found at the composition of x=0.075, with Q m=1595, k p=0.61, d 33=318 pC/N, tan\u03b4=0.6 %, which shows that the ceramics in this work has great potential in high-power piezoelectric applications. In order to systematically study the temperature characteristics of the x=0.075 ceramic, we measure its parameters under different temperatures in the following study. The temperature coefficients of the piezoelectric properties were measured in the temperature range from room temperature to 175 \u2103 due to the fact that the actual operating temperature of piezoelectric materials is generally half of the T c. (a-b) show the impedance and phase angle \u03c6 as functions of frequency for x=0.075 ceramic. The frequency bandwidth \u2206f (\u2206f=f a-f r) slightly decreases from 20 kHz to 17 kHz while the relative bandwidth decreases from 14.8 % to 12.3 %. In the radial vibration mode of thin circular plates, the relative bandwidth is generally between 1.6 % and 15 %. Therefore, this material has a large relative bandwidth and could be applied in frequency devices such as filter. c shows the variation of the elastic compliance coefficient S 11 E for the x=0.075 ceramic over the temperature range from 0 \u2103 to 175 \u2103. As the temperature increases, the pinning effect of defect dipoles on domains weaken and the entire grain movement caused by non-180\xb0 domain wall motion generates elastic deformation in the ceramics, which form a stress field inside the ceramic and reduce the S 11 E. The resonant frequency is calculated by the following equation : Where \u03d5 is diameter of the ceramic, \u03c3 is Poisson's ratio, \u03c1 is density of the ceramic, B is the root of the Bessel function, which is positively correlated with the Poisson's ratio. When the external temperature increases, the Poisson's ratio increases and the S 11 E decreases. The non-resonant frequency of the sample does not shift because of the strong domain clamping effect, making it useful for some devices working at non-resonant frequency such as non-resonant piezoelectric actuators. b shows that the phase angle \u03c6 of the x=0.075 ceramic is about 90\xb0 at room temperature, indicating that it has low mechanical loss and is fully poled. It also can be seen that the \u03c6 slightly decreases from 90\xb0 to 88\xb0 when the temperature increases from 25\u2103 to 175 \u2103. d shows the variation of temperature coefficients with external temperature changes. It can be seen that the \u2206f r/f r 25\u2103 is 2.2 % and the \u2206k p/k p 25\u2103 is 8.7 %, indicating that the 0.075PMS-0.925PZT ceramic has good temperature stability. Previous studies have reported that T-phase dominated piezoelectric ceramics exhibit good temperature stability because of the existence of short and broad electric domains. e shows AFM phase diagram of the sample, from which we can see the short and broad striped domains with random arrangement. The Q m and \u03b5r as a function of temperature for x=0.075 ceramic is shown in f, the Q m of the sample is higher than 600 at 175\u2103 while the \u03b5 r increases from 1064 to 1781, satisfying the application requirements at high temperature. As we all know, the temperature-dependent saturated P-E loops were conducted to determine the thermal reliability of piezoelectricity due to the reorientation of ferroelectric dipoles. (a-b) shows the P-E loops and I-E loops of the x=0.075 ceramic measured from 25 \u2103 to 175 \u2103. It can be found that the P r increases from 4.3 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} to 10.0 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} while the E c decreases from 30.1 kV/cm to 16.0 kV/cm monotonously when the temperature rises from 25 \u2103 to 175 \u2103. Moreover, the temperature dependence of internal bias field E i for the x=0.075 ceramics is shown in c. It can be seen that the E i decreases from 3.6 kV/cm to 2.5 kV/cm.
