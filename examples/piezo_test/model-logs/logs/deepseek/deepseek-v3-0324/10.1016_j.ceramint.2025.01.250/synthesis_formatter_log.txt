**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'solid-state reaction', 'precursors': ['CaCO3', 'Na2CO3', 'Pr6O11', 'CeO2', 'Bi2O3', 'TiO2', 'MnO2'], 'steps': ['Powders were ground using a planetary ball mill for 12 h with anhydrous ethanol as the solvent.', 'The ball-milling mixture was dried at 70 °C for 6 h.', 'The dried powders were calcined for 4 h at 850 °C.', '0.2 wt% MnO2 was added to the calcined powders.', 'The calcined powders were ground using the planetary ball mill for 12 h and dried again.', 'A 6 wt% polyvinyl alcohol binder (PVA) was added to the calcined powders.', 'The powders were pressed into discs under a pressure of 6–8 MPa.', 'The discs were heated at 600 °C for 2 h to remove the PVA.', 'The pellets were sintered at 950 °C-1050 °C for 2.5 h in the air.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'SEM', 'XPS', 'PFM']}}

- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
