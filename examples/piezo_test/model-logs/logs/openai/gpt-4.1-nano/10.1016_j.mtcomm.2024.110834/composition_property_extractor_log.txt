# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a), (b) and (c) show the XPS spectra of N 1 s, Sc 2p, Al 2p and O 1 s for the film deposited at substrate temperature (Tsub) of 400 \u2103 and working pressure of 0.52 Pa. (d), (e) and (f) show the XPS spectra of N 1 s, Sc 2p, Al 2p and O 1 s of the film after 120 s ArE^{+} etching. The spectra of Sc 2p were fitted with Sc-N and Sc-O and Al 2p were composited of Al-O and Al-N. The O1s spectra obtained from the film surface and in the bulk were fitted with O-metal and C-O peaks, which is consistent with the results reported by M.S. The atomic percentages of Al, Sc, N, and O of the sample surface are 24, 15, 21, and 40 at%. After etching for 120 s (15 nm), the atomic percentages of Al, Sc, N, and O changed to 35, 19, 37, and 8 at%. (g) shows the TEM elemental maps of the Al, N, Sc and O over the cross-section of the film deposited on nE^{+}-Si substrate at 400 \u2103 and 0.52 Pa, with atomic percentages of 33 at% Al, 17 at% Sc, 40 at% N, and 10 at% O. The EDX and XPS analyses give very close composition of the film, with the Sc/(Sc+Al) ratio of \u223c 35 %. The oxygen in the film bulk stems from residual O2 and H2O impurities in the vacuum chamber even though purification efforts have been put as described in the experimental part. The metallic oxides Al-O (formation energy: \u22121675.7 kJ/mol) and Sc-O (-1908.8 kJ/mol) are unavoidable due to their lower formation energy compared to the formation energy of Al-N (-317.7 kJ/mol) and Sc-N(173.7 kJ/mol). (a)-(b) exhibit the SEM images of Al0.65Sc0.35N films deposited under different sputtering pressures. The substrate temperature was fixed at 400 \u2103. Deposited at 0.32 Pa, the film surface is characterized by densely-compacted small round grains. When the sputtering pressure is 0.70 Pa, pores emerge in the thin films, and with a further increase of the sputtering pressure to 0.90 Pa, the size and number of the pores increased. The grains of Al0.65Sc0.35N film prepared at 0.52 Pa are pebble-like, and the AOGs are obvious in the films deposited at 0.70 and 0.90 Pa. The schematic diagram of AOGs embedded in the film is shown in (e), the AOGs have pyramidal morphology with significant facets relative to the small round grains with (002) orientation. This facilitates the appearance of more AOGs, because they preferred to nucleate at the less compact grain boundaries, especially where Sc accumulates. In addition, an increase in thickness of the films deposited at high working pressures also benefits the growth of AOGs. (f) shows the XRR curves of the Al0.65Sc0.35N films deposited at different sputtering pressures. It is obvious that with the sputtering pressure increased, the oscillation period of the XRR curves decreased, indicating an increase in thickness. The thickness of the film was calculated by the following formula: Where \u03bb is the CuK\u03b1 X-ray wavelength of 1.5406 \xc5, \u03b8n+1 and \u03b8n are the 2\u03b8 positions of two adjacent oscillation peaks. The thicknesses of Al0.65Sc0.35N film deposited at 0.32, 0.52, 0.70 and 0.90 Pa are 105, 152, 219 and 230 nm, respectively. A faster intensity decay rate of the XRR curve indicates a rougher surface. Therefore, the XRR results indicate that as the deposition pressure increases, the film surface roughness also increases. Additionally, as the sputtering pressure increased, the critical angle of total external reflection decreased, suggesting a decrease in the film density. (g) shows the XRD pattern of Al0.65Sc0.35N films deposited under 0.32\u20130.90 Pa. The (002) diffraction peaks of the films deposited at the working pressure of 0.32 and 0.52 Pa are evident, which indicates the Al0.65Sc0.35N films are highly c-axis oriented. For the film deposited at 0.32 Pa, the (002) peak shifts to a lower 2\u03b8 position implying the presence of the high a compressive stress in the film. In contrast, little shift of the (002) diffraction peak is observed for the AlScN thin film deposited at 0.52 Pa. The significant reduction of compressive stress is attributed to the decreasing kinetic energy of sputtered particles at higher sputtering pressure, along with an increase film thickness and more defects, including the AOGs. In the XRD pattern, there is a weak shoulder peak appears at 2\u03b8 = 34.9 \xb0. This result is similar to the XRD results reported by D. For the films deposited at 0.70 and 0.90 Pa, the (002) peak intensity is very low, indicating poor crystallinity of the Al0.65Sc0.35N films. Combining the SEM and XRD analysis results, it can be concluded that the sputtering pressure imposed significant effects on the density, crystalline quality, and microstructure of the AlScN films. In accordance with the well-known SZM model, sputtering performed at high pressures results in a decrease in film density and an increase in porosity of the films. And especially for sputtered AlScN films, the AOGs play a sensitive role to determine the internal residual stress and crystallographic growth. The AOGs are almost invisible for film deposited at 0.32 Pa, however, the compressive residual stress is significant. For films deposited at 0.70 and 0.90 Pa, the appearance of a large number of AOGs weakens the (002) preferred-orientation. The appropriate working pressure optimized in current work is 0.52 Pa. (a) shows the scatter plot of roughness and the column graph of the breakdown field (Ebd) for the Al0.65Sc0.35N films deposited under various sputtering pressures. The surface roughness of Al0.65Sc0.35N films deposited at 0.32, 0.52, 0.70, and 0.90 Pa was 0.59, 1.39, 1.84, and 1.94 nm, respectively, using AFM data analyzed with Gwyddion software. The results were consistent with the XRR analysis. The electrical breakdown field (Ebd) of Al0.65Sc0.35N film deposited under 0.32, 0.52, 0.70 and 0.90 Pa is 7.2, 5.1, 4.2 and 4.0 MV/cm. The Ebd of the Al0.65Sc0.35N film deposited at 0.32 Pa is far higher than the films deposited at 0.52\u20130.90 Pa because the film deposited at 0.32 Pa is the densest and smoothest. (b) exhibits the leakage current of the Al0.65Sc0.35N films deposited under different pressures. As the working pressure increased, the leakage current increased due to the increment of roughness and the reduction of densification. (c) shows the transient current results of the Al0.65Sc0.35N films deposited under different sputtering pressures. The Al0.65Sc0.35N film deposited at 0.32 Pa did not exhibit a ferroelectric polarization switching current due to the large compressive internal stress. The films prepared at 0.70\u20130.90 Pa also failed to exhibit polarization switching current because too many AOGs lead to the loss of (002) orientation and poor crystallinity. The Al0.65Sc0.35N film deposited at 0.52 Pa exhibits a pronounced ferroelectric polarization switching current peak due to the c-axis texture though there exist a few AOGs and cubic phase in the film. Meanwhile, the few number AOGs contribute to tensile stress, which obviously reduces the ferroelectric polarization switching energy barrier of the film deposited at 0.52 Pa. According to Thornton\u2019s structure zone model (SZM), the ratio of substrate temperature (Tsub) to the melting temperature (Tm) of the material is a key factor determined morphological structure of the film prepared by sputtering pressure. For reactive sputtering of insulating materials, achieving film growth in Zone T (0.1< Tsub/Tm< 0.30, the melting point of pure AlN is 2473 K) requires considering not only the SZM as a guide, but also the effects of sputtering power and reactant gas flow on grain growth. When the deposition temperature is below 400\xb0C, zones I and T typically dominate. (a) shows the XRR curves of the Al0.65Sc0.35N films deposited at different temperatures. The thickness of the films deposited at different temperatures of 200, 400 and 500 \u2103 are 171, 152 and 145 nm. The \u03b8-2\u03b8 XRD patterns of the Al0.65Sc0.35N films deposited at temperatures of 200\u2013500 \u2103 are shown in (b). The (100) and (101) peaks were absent, while the (002) peak was obvious, indicating the films were c-axis preferred orientated. The (002) peak intensity of Al0.65Sc0.35N films increased when the temperature increased from 200 to 400 \u2103, then decreased at 500 \u2103. The full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the (002) diffraction peak is 0.42\xb0, 0.39\xb0, and 0.40\xb0 for films deposited of 200, 400, and 500 \u2103. This indicates that the film prepared at 400 \u2103 exhibits the best crystalline quality. In the range of 200\u2013400 \u2103, the thermal energy of atoms increased with increasing substrate temperature, and the surface diffusion ability of the atoms improved, promoting migration and rearrangement, which is conducive to well-aligned (002) orientation. Therefore, the Al0.65Sc0.35N film is uniform and dense deposited at 400 \u2103. Increasing the substrate temperature to 500\u2103 enhanced the re-evaporation effect, reducing the density of gases and ions around the substrate. It also can be found in XRD pattern that when the substrate temperatures are 200 and 400 \xb0C, the (002) diffraction peak positions are almost identical. However, at a substrate temperature of 500 \xb0C, the (002) diffraction peak of the film shifts noticeably toward higher angle. The variation in the (002) diffraction peak positions of Al0.65Sc0.35N films deposited at different temperatures is primarily attributed to the differences in stress resulting from variations in thermal stress and the number of AOGs. (c) shows the bar chart of the deposition rate of the film deposited with temperatures of 200, 400 and 500 \u2103. With substrate temperature improved, the deposition rate decreased from 2.85 to 2.42 nm/min due to enhanced migration and re-evaporation effects. (d)-(f) illustrates the SEM surface images of Al0.65Sc0.35N films prepared at various substrate temperatures of 200, 400 and 500 \u2103. At lower substrate temperature of 200 \u2103, atomic diffusion capability is limited, causing the atoms arriving at the substrate surface to be covered by subsequently deposited atoms before fully diffusing on the surface. As shown in (d)-(f), all the films exhibit the AOGs due to Sc doping, but the number of AOGs is different. As depicted in (d), the abundance of AOGs results from the relatively low substrate temperature of 200 \u2103. These nanoscale voids, located at grain boundaries, act as nucleation sites for AOGs. The surface morphology of the film deposited at a temperature of 500 \u2103 is shown in (f), the AOGs are obvious. At relative high substrate temperatures during film deposition, bulk diffusion occurs, leading to an increase in grain boundaries, which also facilitates the nucleation of AOGs. Therefore, the substrate temperature affects the grain size and the number of AOGs. (a) shows the scatter plot of roughness and the column graph of the breakdown field (Ebd) for the Al0.65Sc0.35N films deposited at various substrate temperatures. The roughness decreased with the temperature increased, also consistent with the XRR results. The leakage current of Al0.65Sc0.35N films deposited at different temperatures of 200, 400 and 500 \u2103 is shown in (b). With the substrate temperature increased from 200 to 400 \u2103, the leakage current decreased due to well-aligned crystals. However, when the substrate temperature further increased to 500 \u2103, the leakage current increased. The reason is that a greater number of AOGs emerged in the films, leading to a decrease in film density. (c) shows the transient current of Al0.65Sc0.35N films synthesized at various substrate temperatures, tested by an electric field with a frequency of 10 kHz. The results suggest that Al0.65Sc0.35N films deposited at temperatures in the range of 200\u2013500 \u2103 achieve ferroelectric switching. However, the transient current of the film prepared at 200 \u2103 is lower than that of others, while the Al0.65Sc0.35N film deposited at 400 \u2103 exhibited the highest transient current peak, which is attributed to the influence of the number of AOGs on the (002) orientation. The -Ec of Al0.65Sc0.35N ferroelectric films deposited at 200, 400, and 500 \xb0C are 3.5, 3.8, and 3.2 MV/cm. The stress in Al0.65Sc0.35N films deposited at different substrate temperatures is influenced by both thermal stress and the number of AOGs. Thermal stress is related to the coefficients of thermal expansion (CET) of the film and the substrate, as well as the deposition temperature. The CET of Si (111) is 2.6\xd710E^{\u22126}/K, while the CET of Al1-xScxN (x = 0\u20130.41) is in the range of 4.3\u20134.9 \xd7 10E^{\u22126}/K. The formula for thermal strain is: Where T2 is the deposition temperature of the film, T1 is room temperature, \u03b1film is the CET of the film, and \u03b1sub is the CET of the substrate. The impact of AOGs on ferroelectric properties is complex. The XRD (002) diffraction peak positions show no significant difference between substrate temperatures of 200 \u2103 and 400 \u2103. At 200 \u2103, thermal tensile stress is low but the number of AOGs is larger, while at 400 \u2103, the thermal tensile stress is higher but with fewer AOGs. At 400 \u2103, a greater number of ferroelectric domains participate in switching, leading to an increase in coercive field. However, when the substrate temperature is 500 \u2103, the number AOGs and tensile stress from thermal effects increase, resulting in a noticeable decrease in coercive field but a lower peak ferroelectric switching current. (a) shows the cross-sectional TEM images of AlScN/nE^{+}-(111)Si, the AOGs are observed in the image. (b) shows the high-resolution image of the interface cross-section near the top surface of the film. About 3 nm thick of the film has lost its lattice arrangement order, attributed to oxidation after exposure to air. The thin oxide layer (< 5 nm) does not play a critical role in the switching of the ferroelectricity. (c) shows the high-resolution cross-sectional image of the AlScN/nE^{+}-(111)Si interfacial area. There is a 1 nm thick amorphous layer at the interface between nE^{+}-(111)Si substrate and AlScN thin film. (d) shows the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) images of part 1, the interplanar spacing is 2.525 \xc5. (e) exhibits the FFT of the cross-sectional image of the wurtzite AlScN/nE^{+}-(111)Si interface along [001] (c plane) zone axis, indicating a lattice mismatch between the AlScN film and Si substrate. A large leakage current is unavoidable for the Al0.65Sc0.35N ferroelectric films at the high electric field. To distinguish the switching polarization and non-switching polarization from the parasitic contributions (capacitive charging and certain types of leakage current), using the \u2018remanent hysteresis task\u2019 of the Radiant Technologies\u2019 ferroelectric tester. The voltage pulse profile for the remanent hysteresis task is shown in (a). \u2018Logic 1\u2019 is used to measure the total current response, including both switching polarization and non-switching components and \u2018Logic 0\u2019 measures the current response including only the non-switching current. By subtracting the \u2018Logic 0\u2019 curve from the \u2018Logic 1\u2019 measurement results, the effects of leakage current and parasitic contribution effects can be eliminated, resulting in the remanent hysteresis loop. (b) shows the remanent hysteresis of the Al0.65Sc0.35N films synthesized at different temperatures measured at 1 kHz. The Pr value is 154.3 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} of the Al0.65Sc0.35N film deposited at 400 \u2103, and the remanent hysteresis loop exhibited well squareness. The Pr value of Al0.65Sc0.35N film deposited at 200 and 500 \u2103 is 75.4 and 100.2 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}. The results suggest that crystal quality and the number of AOGs affect the Pr value. Yasuoka et al., with the maximum Pr obtained at 400 \u2103. (c) shows the remanent hysteresis loops of Al0.65Sc0.35N films measured at 1 and 10 kHz deposited at 400 \u2103. Yasuoka et al. demonstrated that the ferroelectric switching dynamics of AlScN conform to the Kolmogorov-Avrami-Ishibashi (KAI) model, and with the testing frequency increasing the Ec value increased. The results indicate there is a certain type of current signal that cannot be compensated by the experimental approach besides parasitic contribution, they identified the special current stem from the conductive domain wall by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). As shown in , the P-E curves of TiN/AlScN/nE^{+}-(111)Si capacitors are significant asymmetry, especially with a large difference in the \xb1Ec value. This is attributed to the depletion and inversion state generated by the metal\u2013ferroelectric\u2013semiconductor (MFS) structure on the nE^{+}-Si surface. At positive bias, the MFS is in a depletion state with space charge located below the Si surface, requiring a larger electric field to achieve ferroelectric switching. At negative bias, the MFS structure is in the accumulation state, the excess mobile charge carriers are close to the Al1\u2013xScxN/Si interface and the electric field is fully applied across the ferroelectric layer. Yassine et al.. shows the Pr-E curves of Al0.65Sc0.35N films deposited at different temperatures and measured at various frequencies (2, 5 and 10 kHz). As shown in , the remanent polarization value (Pr) of the ferroelectric Al0.65Sc0.35N film increases with the electric field. It is worth noting that at the deposition temperature of 400 \u2103, the domain switching is relatively concentrated within a narrow electric field range. This is because at a substrate of 400 \u2103, the grains of Al0.65Sc0.35N film are well-aligned and the domain orientation is much more consistent. For the Al0.65Sc0.35N film deposited at 200 \u2103, the grains are fine and nonuniform, which results in poor consistency of the (002) phase, it is necessary to apply a larger range electric field. When the substrate temperature is 500 \u2103, although the size of grains enlarges obviously, the size and number of AOGs also increase, which leads to greater inconsistency in the (002) phase. PFM provides a direct method for observing ferroelectric domains, while S. Wang et al. employed the 4D-Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (4D-STEM) method to directly observe charge density and electron polarization in ZrO2 films.

# TITLE
Effect of abnormally oriented grains on the ferroelectric properties of Al<inf>0.65</inf>Sc<inf>0.35</inf>N thin films

# ABSTRACT
The wide bandgap wurtzite Al1-xScxN ferroelectric material is compatible with semiconductor processes and offers advantages such as high remanent polarization (Pr) and high-temperature stability. To clear the relationship between the structure zone model (SZM), abnormally oriented grains (AOGs) and the ferroelectric properties, the Al0.65Sc0.35N films were prepared at various sputtering pressures (0.32â0.90â¯Pa) and substrate temperatures (200â500 â) on low resistance n+-(111) Si substrate by the radio frequency dual-source reactive magnetron sputtering method using Al and Sc targets under pure N2 gas. The introduction of AOGs facilitates compressive stress reduction and promotes ferroelectric switching. However, excessive AOGs will damage the (002) orientation, leading to loss of ferroelectricity. The Al0.65Sc0.35N films synthesized under a sputtering pressure of 0.52â¯Pa and a substrate temperature of 400 â exhibited a lower leakage current at high electric field, with a Pr value of 154.3 Î¼C/cm2 and a negative coercive field (Ec
                     -) of 3.1â¯MV/cm at a testing frequency of 1â¯kHz. The outstanding comprehensive properties support the large potential of Al1-xScxN ferroelectric material for high-performance FeRAM devices.

# INTRODUCTION
In 2009, Akiyama et al. discovered that Sc doping in AlN can effectively improve the piezoelectric constant (d33) by about 400 % compared to pure AlN film. Since then, the excellent piezoelectric properties of Al1-xScxN films have attracted much attention. The electromechanical coupling coefficient (k) of the Al0.7Sc0.3N thin film prepared by G. Wingqvist et al. is 15 %, while the k value of pure AlN is only 7 %. Ten years later, in 2019, S. Fichtner et al. first demonstrated the ferroelectricity of Al1-xScxN (x = 0.27\u20130.43) films deposited using reactive magnetron sputtering method. When x = 0.36, the Pr value is about 100 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} and the coercive field (Ec) is 3.0 MV/cm measured at 711 Hz. In addition to the magnetron sputtering, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), pulsed laser deposition (PLD), and metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) methods were used to prepare Al1-xScxN ferroelectric thin films. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the ferroelectricity of epitaxial and non-epitaxial Al1-xScxN thin films prepared by different methods. However, reactive magnetron sputtering takes the advantages of low cost and low deposition temperature (< 400 \u2103), the latter satisfies the thermal budget of complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) back-end-of-line (BEOL) integration. AlScN ferroelectric materials exhibit a large remanent polarization (Pr > 100 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}), high coercive field (2\u20135 MV/cm) and excellent tolerance to extreme environments, retaining significant ferroelectric switching even at 600 \xb0C. These features are especially advantageous for nonvolatile memory (NVM) applications. Large Pr benefits the size downscaling of the storage capacitor in ferroelectric random access memory (FeRAM), and high Ec contributes to a huge increase in the memory window of the ferroelectric field effect transistor (FeFET). Consequently, AlScN ferroelectrics hold tremendous memory device application potential in the context of rapidly developing big data and artificial intelligence (AI) technology. As proposed in Thornton\u2019s structure zone model (SZM), the microstructure of the thin films is determined by the sputtering pressure and the ratio of substrate temperature (Tsub) to the melting point (Tm) of material being deposited (i.e. For sputtered Al1-xScxN films, the structure with density-densely compacted, slender columnar grains (i.e. Zone T) was found to be beneficial for improving the piezoelectric performance and could effectively reduce the number of abnormal orientation grains (AOGs). An increase in the number of AOGs will cause the thin film to transition from compressive to tensile stress state, and the piezoelectric constant will decrease. The effects of substrate temperature and sputtering pressure on the microstructure and related piezoelectric properties of Al1-xScxN films have been reported in the papers , but the study of their effects on the ferroelectric properties is still limited. In this paper, Al0.65Sc0.35N films were deposited on low resistance nE^{+}-(111) Si substrate by reactive magnetron sputtering method under various sputtering pressures (0.32\u20130.90 Pa) and at different substrate temperatures (200\u2013500 \u2103).

# CONCLUSION
In summary, the Al0.65Sc0.35N films were deposited on low-resistance nE^{+}-(111)Si substrate under various sputtering pressures and substrate temperatures using the dual-source reactive RF magnetron sputtering method. Notably, Al0.65Sc0.35N films obtained under 0.32 Pa did not exhibit ferroelectricity due to large compressive stress despite possessing the preferred c-axis orientation. At higher (0.70\u20130.90 Pa) sputtering pressures, AOGs cause the loss of c-axis orientation, leading to the loss of ferroelectricity in Al0.65Sc0.35N films. However, the AlScN film deposited at 0.52 Pa with some AOGs obtained ferroelectricity. The AOGs cause compressive reduction, which is advantageous to reducing ferroelectric potential barriers. The Al0.65Sc0.35N films deposited at temperatures in the range of 200\u2013500 \u2103 all demonstrated ferroelectric switching. The substrate temperature affected the crystalline quality, grain size, thermal stress and the number of AOGs, which in turn significantly influenced the Ec and Pr values.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a), (b) and (c) show the XPS spectra of N 1 s, Sc 2p, Al 2p and O 1 s for the film deposited at substrate temperature (Tsub) of 400 \u2103 and working pressure of 0.52 Pa. (d), (e) and (f) show the XPS spectra of N 1 s, Sc 2p, Al 2p and O 1 s of the film after 120 s ArE^{+} etching. The spectra of Sc 2p were fitted with Sc-N and Sc-O and Al 2p were composited of Al-O and Al-N. The O1s spectra obtained from the film surface and in the bulk were fitted with O-metal and C-O peaks, which is consistent with the results reported by M.S. The atomic percentages of Al, Sc, N, and O of the sample surface are 24, 15, 21, and 40 at%. After etching for 120 s (15 nm), the atomic percentages of Al, Sc, N, and O changed to 35, 19, 37, and 8 at%. (g) shows the TEM elemental maps of the Al, N, Sc and O over the cross-section of the film deposited on nE^{+}-Si substrate at 400 \u2103 and 0.52 Pa, with atomic percentages of 33 at% Al, 17 at% Sc, 40 at% N, and 10 at% O. The EDX and XPS analyses give very close composition of the film, with the Sc/(Sc+Al) ratio of \u223c 35 %. The oxygen in the film bulk stems from residual O2 and H2O impurities in the vacuum chamber even though purification efforts have been put as described in the experimental part. The metallic oxides Al-O (formation energy: \u22121675.7 kJ/mol) and Sc-O (-1908.8 kJ/mol) are unavoidable due to their lower formation energy compared to the formation energy of Al-N (-317.7 kJ/mol) and Sc-N(173.7 kJ/mol). (a)-(b) exhibit the SEM images of Al0.65Sc0.35N films deposited under different sputtering pressures. The substrate temperature was fixed at 400 \u2103. Deposited at 0.32 Pa, the film surface is characterized by densely-compacted small round grains. When the sputtering pressure is 0.70 Pa, pores emerge in the thin films, and with a further increase of the sputtering pressure to 0.90 Pa, the size and number of the pores increased. The grains of Al0.65Sc0.35N film prepared at 0.52 Pa are pebble-like, and the AOGs are obvious in the films deposited at 0.70 and 0.90 Pa. The schematic diagram of AOGs embedded in the film is shown in (e), the AOGs have pyramidal morphology with significant facets relative to the small round grains with (002) orientation. This facilitates the appearance of more AOGs, because they preferred to nucleate at the less compact grain boundaries, especially where Sc accumulates. In addition, an increase in thickness of the films deposited at high working pressures also benefits the growth of AOGs. (f) shows the XRR curves of the Al0.65Sc0.35N films deposited at different sputtering pressures. It is obvious that with the sputtering pressure increased, the oscillation period of the XRR curves decreased, indicating an increase in thickness. The thickness of the film was calculated by the following formula: Where \u03bb is the CuK\u03b1 X-ray wavelength of 1.5406 \xc5, \u03b8n+1 and \u03b8n are the 2\u03b8 positions of two adjacent oscillation peaks. The thicknesses of Al0.65Sc0.35N film deposited at 0.32, 0.52, 0.70 and 0.90 Pa are 105, 152, 219 and 230 nm, respectively. A faster intensity decay rate of the XRR curve indicates a rougher surface. Therefore, the XRR results indicate that as the deposition pressure increases, the film surface roughness also increases. Additionally, as the sputtering pressure increased, the critical angle of total external reflection decreased, suggesting a decrease in the film density. (g) shows the XRD pattern of Al0.65Sc0.35N films deposited under 0.32\u20130.90 Pa. The (002) diffraction peaks of the films deposited at the working pressure of 0.32 and 0.52 Pa are evident, which indicates the Al0.65Sc0.35N films are highly c-axis oriented. For the film deposited at 0.32 Pa, the (002) peak shifts to a lower 2\u03b8 position implying the presence of the high a compressive stress in the film. In contrast, little shift of the (002) diffraction peak is observed for the AlScN thin film deposited at 0.52 Pa. The significant reduction of compressive stress is attributed to the decreasing kinetic energy of sputtered particles at higher sputtering pressure, along with an increase film thickness and more defects, including the AOGs. In the XRD pattern, there is a weak shoulder peak appears at 2\u03b8 = 34.9 \xb0. This result is similar to the XRD results reported by D. For the films deposited at 0.70 and 0.90 Pa, the (002) peak intensity is very low, indicating poor crystallinity of the Al0.65Sc0.35N films. Combining the SEM and XRD analysis results, it can be concluded that the sputtering pressure imposed significant effects on the density, crystalline quality, and microstructure of the AlScN films. In accordance with the well-known SZM model, sputtering performed at high pressures results in a decrease in film density and an increase in porosity of the films. And especially for sputtered AlScN films, the AOGs play a sensitive role to determine the internal residual stress and crystallographic growth. The AOGs are almost invisible for film deposited at 0.32 Pa, however, the compressive residual stress is significant. For films deposited at 0.70 and 0.90 Pa, the appearance of a large number of AOGs weakens the (002) preferred-orientation. The appropriate working pressure optimized in current work is 0.52 Pa. (a) shows the scatter plot of roughness and the column graph of the breakdown field (Ebd) for the Al0.65Sc0.35N films deposited under various sputtering pressures. The surface roughness of Al0.65Sc0.35N films deposited at 0.32, 0.52, 0.70, and 0.90 Pa was 0.59, 1.39, 1.84, and 1.94 nm, respectively, using AFM data analyzed with Gwyddion software. The results were consistent with the XRR analysis. The electrical breakdown field (Ebd) of Al0.65Sc0.35N film deposited under 0.32, 0.52, 0.70 and 0.90 Pa is 7.2, 5.1, 4.2 and 4.0 MV/cm. The Ebd of the Al0.65Sc0.35N film deposited at 0.32 Pa is far higher than the films deposited at 0.52\u20130.90 Pa because the film deposited at 0.32 Pa is the densest and smoothest. (b) exhibits the leakage current of the Al0.65Sc0.35N films deposited under different pressures. As the working pressure increased, the leakage current increased due to the increment of roughness and the reduction of densification. (c) shows the transient current results of the Al0.65Sc0.35N films deposited under different sputtering pressures. The Al0.65Sc0.35N film deposited at 0.32 Pa did not exhibit a ferroelectric polarization switching current due to the large compressive internal stress. The films prepared at 0.70\u20130.90 Pa also failed to exhibit polarization switching current because too many AOGs lead to the loss of (002) orientation and poor crystallinity. The Al0.65Sc0.35N film deposited at 0.52 Pa exhibits a pronounced ferroelectric polarization switching current peak due to the c-axis texture though there exist a few AOGs and cubic phase in the film. Meanwhile, the few number AOGs contribute to tensile stress, which obviously reduces the ferroelectric polarization switching energy barrier of the film deposited at 0.52 Pa. According to Thornton\u2019s structure zone model (SZM), the ratio of substrate temperature (Tsub) to the melting temperature (Tm) of the material is a key factor determined morphological structure of the film prepared by sputtering pressure. For reactive sputtering of insulating materials, achieving film growth in Zone T (0.1< Tsub/Tm< 0.30, the melting point of pure AlN is 2473 K) requires considering not only the SZM as a guide, but also the effects of sputtering power and reactant gas flow on grain growth. When the deposition temperature is below 400\xb0C, zones I and T typically dominate. (a) shows the XRR curves of the Al0.65Sc0.35N films deposited at different temperatures. The thickness of the films deposited at different temperatures of 200, 400 and 500 \u2103 are 171, 152 and 145 nm. The \u03b8-2\u03b8 XRD patterns of the Al0.65Sc0.35N films deposited at temperatures of 200\u2013500 \u2103 are shown in (b). The (100) and (101) peaks were absent, while the (002) peak was obvious, indicating the films were c-axis preferred orientated. The (002) peak intensity of Al0.65Sc0.35N films increased when the temperature increased from 200 to 400 \u2103, then decreased at 500 \u2103. The full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the (002) diffraction peak is 0.42\xb0, 0.39\xb0, and 0.40\xb0 for films deposited of 200, 400, and 500 \u2103. This indicates that the film prepared at 400 \u2103 exhibits the best crystalline quality. In the range of 200\u2013400 \u2103, the thermal energy of atoms increased with increasing substrate temperature, and the surface diffusion ability of the atoms improved, promoting migration and rearrangement, which is conducive to well-aligned (002) orientation. Therefore, the Al0.65Sc0.35N film is uniform and dense deposited at 400 \u2103. Increasing the substrate temperature to 500\u2103 enhanced the re-evaporation effect, reducing the density of gases and ions around the substrate. It also can be found in XRD pattern that when the substrate temperatures are 200 and 400 \xb0C, the (002) diffraction peak positions are almost identical. However, at a substrate temperature of 500 \xb0C, the (002) diffraction peak of the film shifts noticeably toward higher angle. The variation in the (002) diffraction peak positions of Al0.65Sc0.35N films deposited at different temperatures is primarily attributed to the differences in stress resulting from variations in thermal stress and the number of AOGs. (c) shows the bar chart of the deposition rate of the film deposited with temperatures of 200, 400 and 500 \u2103. With substrate temperature improved, the deposition rate decreased from 2.85 to 2.42 nm/min due to enhanced migration and re-evaporation effects. (d)-(f) illustrates the SEM surface images of Al0.65Sc0.35N films prepared at various substrate temperatures of 200, 400 and 500 \u2103. At lower substrate temperature of 200 \u2103, atomic diffusion capability is limited, causing the atoms arriving at the substrate surface to be covered by subsequently deposited atoms before fully diffusing on the surface. As shown in (d)-(f), all the films exhibit the AOGs due to Sc doping, but the number of AOGs is different. As depicted in (d), the abundance of AOGs results from the relatively low substrate temperature of 200 \u2103. These nanoscale voids, located at grain boundaries, act as nucleation sites for AOGs. The surface morphology of the film deposited at a temperature of 500 \u2103 is shown in (f), the AOGs are obvious. At relative high substrate temperatures during film deposition, bulk diffusion occurs, leading to an increase in grain boundaries, which also facilitates the nucleation of AOGs. Therefore, the substrate temperature affects the grain size and the number of AOGs. (a) shows the scatter plot of roughness and the column graph of the breakdown field (Ebd) for the Al0.65Sc0.35N films deposited at various substrate temperatures. The roughness decreased with the temperature increased, also consistent with the XRR results. The leakage current of Al0.65Sc0.35N films deposited at different temperatures of 200, 400 and 500 \u2103 is shown in (b). With the substrate temperature increased from 200 to 400 \u2103, the leakage current decreased due to well-aligned crystals. However, when the substrate temperature further increased to 500 \u2103, the leakage current increased. The reason is that a greater number of AOGs emerged in the films, leading to a decrease in film density. (c) shows the transient current of Al0.65Sc0.35N films synthesized at various substrate temperatures, tested by an electric field with a frequency of 10 kHz. The results suggest that Al0.65Sc0.35N films deposited at temperatures in the range of 200\u2013500 \u2103 achieve ferroelectric switching. However, the transient current of the film prepared at 200 \u2103 is lower than that of others, while the Al0.65Sc0.35N film deposited at 400 \u2103 exhibited the highest transient current peak, which is attributed to the influence of the number of AOGs on the (002) orientation. The -Ec of Al0.65Sc0.35N ferroelectric films deposited at 200, 400, and 500 \xb0C are 3.5, 3.8, and 3.2 MV/cm. The stress in Al0.65Sc0.35N films deposited at different substrate temperatures is influenced by both thermal stress and the number of AOGs. Thermal stress is related to the coefficients of thermal expansion (CET) of the film and the substrate, as well as the deposition temperature. The CET of Si (111) is 2.6\xd710E^{\u22126}/K, while the CET of Al1-xScxN (x = 0\u20130.41) is in the range of 4.3\u20134.9 \xd7 10E^{\u22126}/K. The formula for thermal strain is: Where T2 is the deposition temperature of the film, T1 is room temperature, \u03b1film is the CET of the film, and \u03b1sub is the CET of the substrate. The impact of AOGs on ferroelectric properties is complex. The XRD (002) diffraction peak positions show no significant difference between substrate temperatures of 200 \u2103 and 400 \u2103. At 200 \u2103, thermal tensile stress is low but the number of AOGs is larger, while at 400 \u2103, the thermal tensile stress is higher but with fewer AOGs. At 400 \u2103, a greater number of ferroelectric domains participate in switching, leading to an increase in coercive field. However, when the substrate temperature is 500 \u2103, the number AOGs and tensile stress from thermal effects increase, resulting in a noticeable decrease in coercive field but a lower peak ferroelectric switching current. (a) shows the cross-sectional TEM images of AlScN/nE^{+}-(111)Si, the AOGs are observed in the image. (b) shows the high-resolution image of the interface cross-section near the top surface of the film. About 3 nm thick of the film has lost its lattice arrangement order, attributed to oxidation after exposure to air. The thin oxide layer (< 5 nm) does not play a critical role in the switching of the ferroelectricity. (c) shows the high-resolution cross-sectional image of the AlScN/nE^{+}-(111)Si interfacial area. There is a 1 nm thick amorphous layer at the interface between nE^{+}-(111)Si substrate and AlScN thin film. (d) shows the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) images of part 1, the interplanar spacing is 2.525 \xc5. (e) exhibits the FFT of the cross-sectional image of the wurtzite AlScN/nE^{+}-(111)Si interface along [001] (c plane) zone axis, indicating a lattice mismatch between the AlScN film and Si substrate. A large leakage current is unavoidable for the Al0.65Sc0.35N ferroelectric films at the high electric field. To distinguish the switching polarization and non-switching polarization from the parasitic contributions (capacitive charging and certain types of leakage current), using the \u2018remanent hysteresis task\u2019 of the Radiant Technologies\u2019 ferroelectric tester. The voltage pulse profile for the remanent hysteresis task is shown in (a). \u2018Logic 1\u2019 is used to measure the total current response, including both switching polarization and non-switching components and \u2018Logic 0\u2019 measures the current response including only the non-switching current. By subtracting the \u2018Logic 0\u2019 curve from the \u2018Logic 1\u2019 measurement results, the effects of leakage current and parasitic contribution effects can be eliminated, resulting in the remanent hysteresis loop. (b) shows the remanent hysteresis of the Al0.65Sc0.35N films synthesized at different temperatures measured at 1 kHz. The Pr value is 154.3 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} of the Al0.65Sc0.35N film deposited at 400 \u2103, and the remanent hysteresis loop exhibited well squareness. The Pr value of Al0.65Sc0.35N film deposited at 200 and 500 \u2103 is 75.4 and 100.2 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}. The results suggest that crystal quality and the number of AOGs affect the Pr value. Yasuoka et al., with the maximum Pr obtained at 400 \u2103. (c) shows the remanent hysteresis loops of Al0.65Sc0.35N films measured at 1 and 10 kHz deposited at 400 \u2103. Yasuoka et al. demonstrated that the ferroelectric switching dynamics of AlScN conform to the Kolmogorov-Avrami-Ishibashi (KAI) model, and with the testing frequency increasing the Ec value increased. The results indicate there is a certain type of current signal that cannot be compensated by the experimental approach besides parasitic contribution, they identified the special current stem from the conductive domain wall by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). As shown in , the P-E curves of TiN/AlScN/nE^{+}-(111)Si capacitors are significant asymmetry, especially with a large difference in the \xb1Ec value. This is attributed to the depletion and inversion state generated by the metal\u2013ferroelectric\u2013semiconductor (MFS) structure on the nE^{+}-Si surface. At positive bias, the MFS is in a depletion state with space charge located below the Si surface, requiring a larger electric field to achieve ferroelectric switching. At negative bias, the MFS structure is in the accumulation state, the excess mobile charge carriers are close to the Al1\u2013xScxN/Si interface and the electric field is fully applied across the ferroelectric layer. Yassine et al.. shows the Pr-E curves of Al0.65Sc0.35N films deposited at different temperatures and measured at various frequencies (2, 5 and 10 kHz). As shown in , the remanent polarization value (Pr) of the ferroelectric Al0.65Sc0.35N film increases with the electric field. It is worth noting that at the deposition temperature of 400 \u2103, the domain switching is relatively concentrated within a narrow electric field range. This is because at a substrate of 400 \u2103, the grains of Al0.65Sc0.35N film are well-aligned and the domain orientation is much more consistent. For the Al0.65Sc0.35N film deposited at 200 \u2103, the grains are fine and nonuniform, which results in poor consistency of the (002) phase, it is necessary to apply a larger range electric field. When the substrate temperature is 500 \u2103, although the size of grains enlarges obviously, the size and number of AOGs also increase, which leads to greater inconsistency in the (002) phase. PFM provides a direct method for observing ferroelectric domains, while S. Wang et al. employed the 4D-Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (4D-STEM) method to directly observe charge density and electron polarization in ZrO2 films.

# TITLE
Effect of abnormally oriented grains on the ferroelectric properties of Al<inf>0.65</inf>Sc<inf>0.35</inf>N thin films

# ABSTRACT
The wide bandgap wurtzite Al1-xScxN ferroelectric material is compatible with semiconductor processes and offers advantages such as high remanent polarization (Pr) and high-temperature stability. To clear the relationship between the structure zone model (SZM), abnormally oriented grains (AOGs) and the ferroelectric properties, the Al0.65Sc0.35N films were prepared at various sputtering pressures (0.32â0.90â¯Pa) and substrate temperatures (200â500 â) on low resistance n+-(111) Si substrate by the radio frequency dual-source reactive magnetron sputtering method using Al and Sc targets under pure N2 gas. The introduction of AOGs facilitates compressive stress reduction and promotes ferroelectric switching. However, excessive AOGs will damage the (002) orientation, leading to loss of ferroelectricity. The Al0.65Sc0.35N films synthesized under a sputtering pressure of 0.52â¯Pa and a substrate temperature of 400 â exhibited a lower leakage current at high electric field, with a Pr value of 154.3 Î¼C/cm2 and a negative coercive field (Ec
                     -) of 3.1â¯MV/cm at a testing frequency of 1â¯kHz. The outstanding comprehensive properties support the large potential of Al1-xScxN ferroelectric material for high-performance FeRAM devices.

# INTRODUCTION
In 2009, Akiyama et al. discovered that Sc doping in AlN can effectively improve the piezoelectric constant (d33) by about 400 % compared to pure AlN film. Since then, the excellent piezoelectric properties of Al1-xScxN films have attracted much attention. The electromechanical coupling coefficient (k) of the Al0.7Sc0.3N thin film prepared by G. Wingqvist et al. is 15 %, while the k value of pure AlN is only 7 %. Ten years later, in 2019, S. Fichtner et al. first demonstrated the ferroelectricity of Al1-xScxN (x = 0.27\u20130.43) films deposited using reactive magnetron sputtering method. When x = 0.36, the Pr value is about 100 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} and the coercive field (Ec) is 3.0 MV/cm measured at 711 Hz. In addition to the magnetron sputtering, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), pulsed laser deposition (PLD), and metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) methods were used to prepare Al1-xScxN ferroelectric thin films. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the ferroelectricity of epitaxial and non-epitaxial Al1-xScxN thin films prepared by different methods. However, reactive magnetron sputtering takes the advantages of low cost and low deposition temperature (< 400 \u2103), the latter satisfies the thermal budget of complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) back-end-of-line (BEOL) integration. AlScN ferroelectric materials exhibit a large remanent polarization (Pr > 100 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}), high coercive field (2\u20135 MV/cm) and excellent tolerance to extreme environments, retaining significant ferroelectric switching even at 600 \xb0C. These features are especially advantageous for nonvolatile memory (NVM) applications. Large Pr benefits the size downscaling of the storage capacitor in ferroelectric random access memory (FeRAM), and high Ec contributes to a huge increase in the memory window of the ferroelectric field effect transistor (FeFET). Consequently, AlScN ferroelectrics hold tremendous memory device application potential in the context of rapidly developing big data and artificial intelligence (AI) technology. As proposed in Thornton\u2019s structure zone model (SZM), the microstructure of the thin films is determined by the sputtering pressure and the ratio of substrate temperature (Tsub) to the melting point (Tm) of material being deposited (i.e. For sputtered Al1-xScxN films, the structure with density-densely compacted, slender columnar grains (i.e. Zone T) was found to be beneficial for improving the piezoelectric performance and could effectively reduce the number of abnormal orientation grains (AOGs). An increase in the number of AOGs will cause the thin film to transition from compressive to tensile stress state, and the piezoelectric constant will decrease. The effects of substrate temperature and sputtering pressure on the microstructure and related piezoelectric properties of Al1-xScxN films have been reported in the papers , but the study of their effects on the ferroelectric properties is still limited. In this paper, Al0.65Sc0.35N films were deposited on low resistance nE^{+}-(111) Si substrate by reactive magnetron sputtering method under various sputtering pressures (0.32\u20130.90 Pa) and at different substrate temperatures (200\u2013500 \u2103).

# CONCLUSION
In summary, the Al0.65Sc0.35N films were deposited on low-resistance nE^{+}-(111)Si substrate under various sputtering pressures and substrate temperatures using the dual-source reactive RF magnetron sputtering method. Notably, Al0.65Sc0.35N films obtained under 0.32 Pa did not exhibit ferroelectricity due to large compressive stress despite possessing the preferred c-axis orientation. At higher (0.70\u20130.90 Pa) sputtering pressures, AOGs cause the loss of c-axis orientation, leading to the loss of ferroelectricity in Al0.65Sc0.35N films. However, the AlScN film deposited at 0.52 Pa with some AOGs obtained ferroelectricity. The AOGs cause compressive reduction, which is advantageous to reducing ferroelectric potential barriers. The Al0.65Sc0.35N films deposited at temperatures in the range of 200\u2013500 \u2103 all demonstrated ferroelectric switching. The substrate temperature affected the crystalline quality, grain size, thermal stress and the number of AOGs, which in turn significantly influenced the Ec and Pr values.
