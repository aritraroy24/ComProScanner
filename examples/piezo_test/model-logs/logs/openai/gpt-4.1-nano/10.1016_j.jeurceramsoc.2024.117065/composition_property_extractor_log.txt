# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
To elucidate the contribution of compositional adjustments, we investigated the effects of rare-earth thulium content on the crystal structure and electrical properties of CBN-100xTm ceramics. (a) displays the XRD patterns of non-textured CBN-100xTm ceramics, which match the standard PDF card for CaBi2Nb2O9 (PDF#49\u20130608). No additional distinct characteristic peaks were observed in the XRD patterns, and the most intense peak for each composition is the (115) diffraction peak, corresponding to the (112 m +1) peak of BLSFs. Both the (115) and (200)/(020) diffraction peaks shift to higher angles with increasing thulium content, as shown in (b) and (c). Based on the law summarized by Shannon, the ionic radius of E^{XII}TmE^{3+} is smaller than that of E^{XII}SmE^{3+} (124 pm). Therefore, this shift is attributed to the unit cell volume shrinkage caused by the smaller radius of E^{XII}TmE^{3+} compared to E^{XII}CaE^{2+} (134 pm). Additionally, the split (200) and (020) peaks, characteristic of the orthorhombic phase, gradually converge as thulium content increases, indicating significant lattice distortion. For compositions with x < 0.03, the lattice parameters remain relatively unchanged. However, for compositions with x \u2265 0.03, parameters a and c decrease significantly, while parameter b increases slightly, indicating a convergence of a and b. This decrease indicates a phase transition from the orthorhombic to the pseudo-tetragonal phase, suggesting the formation of a pseudo-phase boundary in the CBN-100xTm system near x = 0.03. Several studies have indicated that polarization switching is facilitated near the pseudo-phase boundary, where high piezoelectric performance can be achieved. presents scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of CBN-100xTm ceramics taken on natural surfaces. Due to the high anisotropy of the layered crystal structure, when the thulium content is less than 0.03 mol, the samples exhibit randomly oriented rod-like or plate-like grains, which is typical for BLSFs. As the thulium content increases to 0.05 mol, the crystal structure transitions from an orthorhombic phase to a pseudo-tetragonal phase, resulting in a transformation in grain morphology. This demonstrates that the grain morphology and size of CBN can be modulated by altering the crystal structure through the addition of thulium. presents the room temperature dielectric, piezoelectric, and electromechanical parameters of CBN-100xTm ceramics. The Curie temperature (T C) shows a gradual increase with increasing thulium substitution, with a particularly notable rise in T C for CBN-5Tm, exceeding pure CBN by over 40\xb0C. All compositions exhibit a dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) ranging between 114 and 139. However, the dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) is significantly reduced through thulium substitution, falling within the range of 0.42\u20130.66 %. In terms of piezoelectricity, the d 33 value of CBN-100xTm ceramics initially increases and then decreases with the increase in thulium content, reaching a peak value of 12.4 pC/N at x = 0.03, which is twice that of pure CBN. This enhancement is due to the pseudo-phase boundary formed at x = 0.03 with the introduction of thulium. The planar electromechanical coupling coefficient (k p) follows a similar trend to d 33, showing a slight increase up to 4.9 %. Additionally, the planar mechanical quality factor (Q m) increases from 2600 to approximately 3500 with thulium introduction, indicating a significant reduction in mechanical losses. These results suggest that compositions near the pseudo-phase boundary in CBN-based ceramics exhibit enhanced piezoelectric properties. To elucidate the phenomenon of improved piezoelectric performance and to study its underlying physical mechanism in depth, domain configurations were investigated using piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). (a) and (c) display phase and amplitude images of domains within a 5\xd75 \u03bcm\xb2 region of CBN and CBN-3Tm ceramics, respectively. The domain morphology and distribution in pure CBN are regular, exhibiting anti-parallel 180\xb0 stripe-like domain structures with lengths exceeding 5 \u03bcm. In contrast, CBN-3Tm, which exhibits pseudo-tetragonal distortion, shows a much more complex distribution of domain structures with significantly reduced sizes, including many submicron domains. To explore the dynamic behavior of these domain structures under an external electric field, phase and amplitude were investigated using the Litho mode of PFM measurement. A 5\xd75 \u03bcm\xb2 region was selected on the sample, and a DC voltage of \u2212100 V was applied to reverse all domains in one direction. Subsequently, four small squares within this region were selected, and DC voltages of +20 V, +40 V, +60 V, and +80 V were applied to them, respectively. As shown in (b) and (d), for pure CBN, domains begin to switch at DC voltages above +40 V, while some domains remain unswitched even at +80 V. In contrast, the domains of CBN-3Tm fully switch at +40 V, displaying clear domain walls and a shape consistent with the written domain range. Comparative results indicate that the pseudo-phase boundary disrupts the original ordered domain structure of pure CBN ceramic, producing complex and smaller domains. According to the classical theory of domains , the electric domain size and domain wall energy follow the relationship below: Where D is the domain thickness, and \u03b3 is the domain wall energy coefficient, respectively. Consequently, the extrinsic contribution of domain walls to the piezoelectric performance is enhanced, leading to a significantly improved piezoelectric constant. (a) shows the DC electrical resistivity of CBN-100xTm ceramics over the temperature range of 200\u2013650 \xb0C. The fitting results are depicted in (b), with the curves divided into low-temperature (LT) and high-temperature (HT) regions. In the LT region, the E a values of CBN-100xTm ceramics range from 0.68 to 0.88 eV, approximately half of the secondary ionization energy of the oxygen vacancy. In the HT region, the E a values for pure CBN and CBN-1Tm are 1.25 eV and 1.20 eV, respectively, indicating that conductivity is driven by the motion of oxygen vacancies. The E a values of CBN-3Tm and CBN-5Tm increase significantly to 1.65\u20131.74 eV, about half of the band gap of CBN. This is because the donor substitution of CaE^{2+} by TmE^{3+} generates electrons , promoting oxygen atoms to be fixed in the crystal lattice , thus reducing the concentration of oxygen vacancies and significantly increasing the DC electrical resistivity. As the level of thulium substitution increases, excess electrons are generated that cannot be effectively neutralized, resulting in a decrease in the DC electrical resistivity of CBN-5Tm. Across the temperature range, the DC electrical resistivity significantly increases with the addition of thulium. Notably, CBN-3Tm ceramic exhibits superior performance, with a DC electrical resistivity reaching 2.6 \xd7 10E^{6} \u03a9 cm at 600\xb0C, nearly two orders of magnitude higher than the 7.3 \xd7 10E^{4} \u03a9 cm resistivity of pure CBN ceramic at the same temperature. The introduction of thulium into CBN offers several advantages: it raises the Curie temperature and reduces the dielectric loss tangent, thereby extending the material's application temperature range. The increased DC electrical resistivity ensures more stable and reliable electrical performance at high temperatures, preventing electrical breakdown during polarization treatment. Despite these improvements, thulium-substituted CBN still falls short of meeting the parameter requirements for practical device applications. Considering the aforementioned benefits and the CBN grain morphology characterized by a large aspect ratio, it is suitable to prepare textured ceramics using a two-step sintering method with a spark plasma sintering system. This approach is expected to further enhance the piezoelectric properties of thulium-substituted CBN. Therefore, the compositions of CBN-2Tm, CBN-3Tm, and CBN-5Tm with different grain morphologies and piezoelectric properties were selected for spark plasma sintering. These compositions serve as a control group to investigate the factors influencing the properties of the textured ceramics. illustrates the X-ray diffraction patterns of non-textured (CS) and textured (SPS[//] and SPS[\u22a5]) CBN-100xTm ceramics. These patterns closely correspond to the orthorhombic phase (A21 am) of the randomly oriented samples, with no discernible impurity phases. In the case of CS samples with the randomly oriented grains, the diffraction peaks from various crystal planes are observed. However, for the SPS CBN-100xTm samples, the intensity of diffraction peaks corresponding to the same crystal plane varies significantly due to the textured orientation of the grains. In comparison to the patterns of the CS samples, the patterns of the SPS[\u22a5] samples exhibit stronger (00 l) diffraction peaks. Conversely, the SPS[//] samples show no visible (00 l) diffraction peaks but intense (200)/(020), (220), and (315)/(135) diffraction peaks. This indicates that a (00 l) preferred orientation is induced by the two-step spark plasma sintering process. To determine the grain orientation ratio of the sample, the Lotgering factor f can be calculated as follows:  \u2211 I (00l) and \u2211 I (hkl) are the sum of the intensity of all (00 l) and (hkl) peaks in the XRD pattern of textured samples, respectively, and \u2211 I 0(00l) and \u2211 I 0(hkl) are obtained from non-textured samples. As indicated in the top right corner of the figures, the Lotgering factors f of textured CBN-2Tm, CBN-3Tm, and CBN-5Tm are 77.4 %, 69.6 %, and 63.1 %, respectively. To validate the conclusions drawn from the XRD patterns, presents SEM images of thermally etched surfaces of textured (SPS[//] and SPS[\u22a5]) CBN-100xTm ceramics. Similar plate-like grains observed in non-textured ceramics are also visible in the textured ceramics, with their c-axis aligned along the SPS pressure direction, consistent with the XRD findings. Additionally, due to the short holding time during the sintering process, the grain size of the SPS samples is smaller than that of the CS samples of the same composition. In this context, CBN-2Tm exhibits the largest grains with the highest degree of anisotropy, resulting in the greatest texturing. (a) shows the piezoelectric constant d 33 of non-textured (CS) and textured (SPS[//]) CBN-100xTm ceramics. Compared to CS ceramics, the SPS[//] ceramics exhibit significantly enhanced d 33 values, indicating that grain orientation is an effective strategy for achieving high-performance textured piezoelectric ceramics. Textured CBN-2Tm with a Lotgering factor (f) of 77.4% in the SPS[//] samples shows superior piezoelectric performance with a d 33 value of 25.2 pC/N. Textured CBN-3Tm, with an f of 69.6%, achieves a d 33 value of 23.5 pC/N, while textured CBN-5Tm, with an f of 63.1%, displays a d 33 value of 18.0 pC/N. In comparison, shows that the non-textured CS CBN-2Tm, CBN-3Tm, and CBN-5Tm have d 33 values of 11.4 pC/N, 12.4 pC/N, and 9.4 pC/N, respectively. These results highlight an interesting contrast: while CS CBN-3Tm exhibits the highest piezoelectric performance among non-textured samples, textured CBN-2Tm shows the best performance among textured compositions. Specifically, the textured SPS[//] CBN-2Tm ceramic, with the highest degree of texturing (f = 77.4 %), exhibits an optimal piezoelectric constant d 33 of 25.2 pC/N. This value is more than twice that of the CS CBN-2Tm ceramic (11.4 pC/N) and four times that of the CS CBN ceramic (\u223c6.0 pC/N). In contrast, the d 33 value of the SPS[\u22a5] CBN-2Tm ceramic is only 1.50 pC/N, demonstrating significant anisotropy in piezoelectric performance. (b) provides a summary comparing the comprehensive performance (piezoelectric constant d 33 and Curie temperature T C) of textured CBN-2Tm ceramics with previously reported CBN-based ceramics. It is worth noting that achieving both high T C and large d 33 is challenging for CBN-based ceramics prepared by conventional solid-state sintering. However, using texturing techniques to prepare compositionally adjusted CBN ceramics proves to be an effective approach for improving overall performance. Notably, rare-earth thulium-substituted CBN ceramics produced through the two-step spark plasma sintering method exhibit superior piezoelectric performance, with a d 33 value of 25.2 pC/N, demonstrating significant potential for high-temperature piezoelectric sensor applications. To investigate the mechanism behind the enhanced piezoelectric properties in textured CBN-2Tm ceramics, domain configurations of non-textured and textured ceramics were compared using PFM. shows phase and amplitude images of domains within a 15\xd715 \u03bcmE^{2} region for CS, SPS[//], and SPS[\u22a5] CBN-2Tm ceramics, respectively. In the CS sample, domains are visible only in certain regions and are randomly oriented, mirroring the random orientation of its grains. This occurs because some domains, oriented in specific directions, only generate in-plane signals under the applied electric field, making them undetectable by the VPFM (Vertical Piezoresponse Force Microscopy) mode, which captures out-of-plane signals. In the SPS[//] sample, most domains are aligned out of plane due to grain orientation, allowing more domains to respond to the external electric field and thus become visible. Conversely, the SPS[\u22a5] sample shows a relatively weaker signal. Consequently, the SPS[//] sample demonstrates enhanced macroscopic piezoelectric properties compared to the CS sample. Additionally, the domain size in the SPS samples is significantly reduced compared to the CS sample, facilitating domain switching, which will be further confirmed through macroscopic ferroelectric property characterization. This is because the spontaneous polarization of CBN can only switch in the a-b plane due to the limitations of the two-dimensional layered structure. Consequently, applying an electric field in the a-b plane produces a stronger polarization response than applying it along the c-axis. presents the ferroelectric properties, temperature-dependent dielectric properties, temperature-dependent DC electrical resistivity, and thermal depoling behaviors of CS, SPS[//], and SPS[\u22a5] CBN-2Tm ceramics. Consequently, as shown in (a-b), the SPS[//] sample exhibits a more saturated ferroelectric hysteresis loop, with a remanent polarization (2P r) of 21.1 \xb5C/cmE^{2}, which is 2.5 times greater than that of the CS sample (8.4 \xb5C/cmE^{2}). It also has a coercive field (E c) of 109 kV/cm and a notable peak in current density, indicating clear domain switching. In comparison, the CS sample shows an increased E c of 121 kV/cm and a significantly reduced peak current density, suggesting a reduction in the number of switching domains. The SPS[\u22a5] sample, on the other hand, displays a narrower hysteresis loop without a current peak, indicating weak ferroelectricity. Regarding the dielectric properties shown in (c-d), the SPS[//] and SPS[\u22a5] samples exhibit Curie temperatures (T C) similar to that of the CS sample, at 946 and 947 \xb0C, respectively. The SPS[//] sample has the highest dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) over the entire test temperature range, while the SPS[\u22a5] sample has the lowest. However, the dielectric loss tangent (tan\u03b4) is reversed, with the SPS[//] sample exhibiting the highest tan\u03b4 due to the intense response of the polarization to the external electric field, although it remains very low at 2.8 % at 600 \xb0C. (e) compares the variation of DC electrical resistivity with elevated temperature for non-textured and textured CBN-100xTm ceramics. The DC electrical resistivity of the SPS[\u22a5] sample is about an order of magnitude higher than that of the CS sample, especially at high temperatures, because carrier transport along the c-axis is blocked by the natural insulating (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layer. Although the DC electrical resistivity of the SPS[//] sample is lower than that of the SPS[\u22a5] sample, it is as high as 4.7 \xd7 10E^{5} \u03a9 cm at 600 \xb0C, which is a significant improvement over pure CBN and meets device requirements. Regarding the depoling behaviors in (f), the piezoelectric properties of both non-textured and textured samples show excellent thermal stability, with the d 33 of the SPS[//] sample retaining 98 % of its room-temperature value of about 24.7 pC/N at 900 \xb0C. In summary, highly oriented CBN ceramics with excellent comprehensive performance have been successfully prepared by combining A-site substitution and texturing techniques.

# TITLE
Spark plasma sintering of high-T<inf>C</inf> calcium bismuth niobate (CaBi<inf>2</inf>Nb<inf>2</inf>O<inf>9</inf>) with superior piezoelectric performance

# ABSTRACT
Calcium bismuth niobate (CaBi2Nb2O9) is a promising ceramic material for high-temperature piezoelectric applications due to its high Curie temperature (T
                     C) of 940 Â°C. However, its practical use is limited by poor piezoelectric performance and low direct-current (DC) electrical resistivity at elevated temperatures. In this study, we introduced pseudo-tetragonal distortion into CaBi2Nb2O9 by substituting rare-earth thulium ions, which reduced domain wall energy, facilitated domain switching, and decreased the presence of oxygen vacancies. These enhancements significantly improved both the piezoelectric performance and DC electrical resistivity of the material. To further enhance piezoelectric performance, we prepared textured thulium-substituted CaBi2Nb2O9 ceramics with a Lotgering factor (f) of up to 77.4â¯% using a two-step spark plasma sintering method. The resulting textured CaBi2Nb2O9 ceramics exhibited superior piezoelectric performance, with a piezoelectric constant d
                     33 of 25.2 pC/N, four times higher than that of non-textured CaBi2Nb2O9.

# INTRODUCTION
With the rapid development of modern industries, the demand for sensors that can operate at high temperatures (\u223c500 \xb0C or higher) has significantly increased. However, the transition of piezoelectric materials from the ferroelectric-phase to the paraelectric-phase causes a sharp decline in the piezoelectric constant (d 33) as the temperature rises. Bismuth layer-structured ferroelectrics (BLSFs) are considered a promising class of piezoelectric materials for high-temperature sensor applications due to their high T C and excellent thermal stability of piezoelectric properties. Among BLSFs, calcium bismuth niobate (CaBi2Nb2O9, CBN) stands out, boasting the highest T C of approximately 940 \xb0C. CBN also benefits from high electrical resistivity, high mechanical quality factor, and low aging rate, all of which are attributed to its unique layered crystal structure consisting of alternating bismuth-oxide (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layers and perovskite-like (CaNb2O7)E^{2-} slabs along the c-axis. The perovskite-like (CaNb2O7)E^{2-} slab is the source of the ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity of CBN, as its polarization primarily arises from the distortion of NbO6 octahedra within the a-b plane. However, polarization switching in CBN is limited by its two-dimensional layered structure, and the high coercive field (E c) makes achieving excellent piezoelectric performance through artificial poling challenging. That results in a low d 33 value of 6.0 pC/N for pure CBN ceramic. To enhance the piezoelectric performance of CBN ceramic, previous studies have focused on modulating the distortion of (CaNb2O7)E^{2-} blocks through compositional adjustments (A- and/or B-site substitutions). For instance, substituting K/Na/Li and Ce ions at the A-site of CBN increases the rotation of the NbO6 octahedra along the b-axis, inducing a pseudo-tetragonal phase boundary and raising the d 33 value to 15\u201316 pC/N. Additionally, boron ions (BE^{3+}) substitution at the B-site of CBN increases lattice distortion, enhancing both ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties. Grain orientation methods, such as hot-forging, hot-pressing, and spark plasma sintering, have also been employed to improve the piezoelectric properties of BLSFs. For example, Yan et al. prepared highly-grain-oriented textured CBN ceramics, achieving a significant increase in d 33 value (19.5 pC/N), although the DC electrical resistivity was reduced by nearly an order of magnitude. For instance, studies have shown that in both (K,Na)NbO3 and (Ba0.85Ca0.15)(Zr0.1Ti0.9)O3 ceramics, the introduction of Tm induces a structural transition from the orthorhombic phase to a coexistence of orthorhombic and tetragonal phases at room temperature. To achieve these modifications in CBN ceramics, we combined the advantages of A/B-site substitutions and grain orientation techniques, fabricating non-textured, rare-earth thulium-modified CBN ceramics via a solid-phase reaction method, and textured thulium-modified CBN ceramics using a two-step spark plasma sintering (TS-SPS) process. We conducted a detailed investigation into the effects of rare-earth thulium modification on the crystal structure and electrical properties of both non-textured and textured CBN ceramics, identifying the key factors influencing the piezoelectric performance of textured CBN ceramics.

# CONCLUSION
In this study, we prepared CBN-100xTm ceramics using the conventional solid-state sintering method to investigate the effects of compositional adjustments on the crystal structure and electrical properties. XRD analysis revealed that the introduction of Tm ions induces a phase transition from the orthorhombic to the pseudo-tetragonal phase, establishing a phase boundary in the composition of CBN-3Tm. PFM results showed that CBN-3Tm ceramics exhibit stripe-like domains with reduced size and complex distribution, which lowers domain wall energy and facilitates full polarization, resulting in an optimal d 33 of 12.4 pC/N. Additionally, the DC electrical resistivity improved by nearly two orders of magnitude due to the reduction of oxygen vacancies caused by the donor substitution of TmE^{3+} for CaE^{2+}. Subsequently, textured CBN-xTm ceramics were prepared using the SPS two-step sintering method, leveraging the plate-like grain morphology. It was found that the degree of grain orientation, influenced by the grain morphology, and the intrinsic piezoelectric properties together determine the piezoelectric performance of textured CBN-xTm ceramics. As a result, textured CBN-2Tm ceramics, with large aspect ratio grains and high intrinsic piezoelectric properties, achieved an optimal d 33 of 25.2 pC/N. The SPS-prepared sample of CBN-2Tm demonstrated excellent comprehensive performance (2P r = 21.1 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, T C = 946 \u2103, tan\u03b4 = 2.8 % at 600 \xb0C, \u03c1 = 4.7 \xd7 10E^{5} \u03a9\xb7cm at 600 \xb0C, d 33 = 24.7 pC/N after annealing at 900 \u2103), making it a promising candidate for high-temperature piezoelectric device development.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
To elucidate the contribution of compositional adjustments, we investigated the effects of rare-earth thulium content on the crystal structure and electrical properties of CBN-100xTm ceramics. (a) displays the XRD patterns of non-textured CBN-100xTm ceramics, which match the standard PDF card for CaBi2Nb2O9 (PDF#49\u20130608). No additional distinct characteristic peaks were observed in the XRD patterns, and the most intense peak for each composition is the (115) diffraction peak, corresponding to the (112 m +1) peak of BLSFs. Both the (115) and (200)/(020) diffraction peaks shift to higher angles with increasing thulium content, as shown in (b) and (c). Based on the law summarized by Shannon, the ionic radius of E^{XII}TmE^{3+} is smaller than that of E^{XII}SmE^{3+} (124 pm). Therefore, this shift is attributed to the unit cell volume shrinkage caused by the smaller radius of E^{XII}TmE^{3+} compared to E^{XII}CaE^{2+} (134 pm). Additionally, the split (200) and (020) peaks, characteristic of the orthorhombic phase, gradually converge as thulium content increases, indicating significant lattice distortion. For compositions with x < 0.03, the lattice parameters remain relatively unchanged. However, for compositions with x \u2265 0.03, parameters a and c decrease significantly, while parameter b increases slightly, indicating a convergence of a and b. This decrease indicates a phase transition from the orthorhombic to the pseudo-tetragonal phase, suggesting the formation of a pseudo-phase boundary in the CBN-100xTm system near x = 0.03. Several studies have indicated that polarization switching is facilitated near the pseudo-phase boundary, where high piezoelectric performance can be achieved. presents scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of CBN-100xTm ceramics taken on natural surfaces. Due to the high anisotropy of the layered crystal structure, when the thulium content is less than 0.03 mol, the samples exhibit randomly oriented rod-like or plate-like grains, which is typical for BLSFs. As the thulium content increases to 0.05 mol, the crystal structure transitions from an orthorhombic phase to a pseudo-tetragonal phase, resulting in a transformation in grain morphology. This demonstrates that the grain morphology and size of CBN can be modulated by altering the crystal structure through the addition of thulium. presents the room temperature dielectric, piezoelectric, and electromechanical parameters of CBN-100xTm ceramics. The Curie temperature (T C) shows a gradual increase with increasing thulium substitution, with a particularly notable rise in T C for CBN-5Tm, exceeding pure CBN by over 40\xb0C. All compositions exhibit a dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) ranging between 114 and 139. However, the dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) is significantly reduced through thulium substitution, falling within the range of 0.42\u20130.66 %. In terms of piezoelectricity, the d 33 value of CBN-100xTm ceramics initially increases and then decreases with the increase in thulium content, reaching a peak value of 12.4 pC/N at x = 0.03, which is twice that of pure CBN. This enhancement is due to the pseudo-phase boundary formed at x = 0.03 with the introduction of thulium. The planar electromechanical coupling coefficient (k p) follows a similar trend to d 33, showing a slight increase up to 4.9 %. Additionally, the planar mechanical quality factor (Q m) increases from 2600 to approximately 3500 with thulium introduction, indicating a significant reduction in mechanical losses. These results suggest that compositions near the pseudo-phase boundary in CBN-based ceramics exhibit enhanced piezoelectric properties. To elucidate the phenomenon of improved piezoelectric performance and to study its underlying physical mechanism in depth, domain configurations were investigated using piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). (a) and (c) display phase and amplitude images of domains within a 5\xd75 \u03bcm\xb2 region of CBN and CBN-3Tm ceramics, respectively. The domain morphology and distribution in pure CBN are regular, exhibiting anti-parallel 180\xb0 stripe-like domain structures with lengths exceeding 5 \u03bcm. In contrast, CBN-3Tm, which exhibits pseudo-tetragonal distortion, shows a much more complex distribution of domain structures with significantly reduced sizes, including many submicron domains. To explore the dynamic behavior of these domain structures under an external electric field, phase and amplitude were investigated using the Litho mode of PFM measurement. A 5\xd75 \u03bcm\xb2 region was selected on the sample, and a DC voltage of \u2212100 V was applied to reverse all domains in one direction. Subsequently, four small squares within this region were selected, and DC voltages of +20 V, +40 V, +60 V, and +80 V were applied to them, respectively. As shown in (b) and (d), for pure CBN, domains begin to switch at DC voltages above +40 V, while some domains remain unswitched even at +80 V. In contrast, the domains of CBN-3Tm fully switch at +40 V, displaying clear domain walls and a shape consistent with the written domain range. Comparative results indicate that the pseudo-phase boundary disrupts the original ordered domain structure of pure CBN ceramic, producing complex and smaller domains. According to the classical theory of domains , the electric domain size and domain wall energy follow the relationship below: Where D is the domain thickness, and \u03b3 is the domain wall energy coefficient, respectively. Consequently, the extrinsic contribution of domain walls to the piezoelectric performance is enhanced, leading to a significantly improved piezoelectric constant. (a) shows the DC electrical resistivity of CBN-100xTm ceramics over the temperature range of 200\u2013650 \xb0C. The fitting results are depicted in (b), with the curves divided into low-temperature (LT) and high-temperature (HT) regions. In the LT region, the E a values of CBN-100xTm ceramics range from 0.68 to 0.88 eV, approximately half of the secondary ionization energy of the oxygen vacancy. In the HT region, the E a values for pure CBN and CBN-1Tm are 1.25 eV and 1.20 eV, respectively, indicating that conductivity is driven by the motion of oxygen vacancies. The E a values of CBN-3Tm and CBN-5Tm increase significantly to 1.65\u20131.74 eV, about half of the band gap of CBN. This is because the donor substitution of CaE^{2+} by TmE^{3+} generates electrons , promoting oxygen atoms to be fixed in the crystal lattice , thus reducing the concentration of oxygen vacancies and significantly increasing the DC electrical resistivity. As the level of thulium substitution increases, excess electrons are generated that cannot be effectively neutralized, resulting in a decrease in the DC electrical resistivity of CBN-5Tm. Across the temperature range, the DC electrical resistivity significantly increases with the addition of thulium. Notably, CBN-3Tm ceramic exhibits superior performance, with a DC electrical resistivity reaching 2.6 \xd7 10E^{6} \u03a9 cm at 600\xb0C, nearly two orders of magnitude higher than the 7.3 \xd7 10E^{4} \u03a9 cm resistivity of pure CBN ceramic at the same temperature. The introduction of thulium into CBN offers several advantages: it raises the Curie temperature and reduces the dielectric loss tangent, thereby extending the material's application temperature range. The increased DC electrical resistivity ensures more stable and reliable electrical performance at high temperatures, preventing electrical breakdown during polarization treatment. Despite these improvements, thulium-substituted CBN still falls short of meeting the parameter requirements for practical device applications. Considering the aforementioned benefits and the CBN grain morphology characterized by a large aspect ratio, it is suitable to prepare textured ceramics using a two-step sintering method with a spark plasma sintering system. This approach is expected to further enhance the piezoelectric properties of thulium-substituted CBN. Therefore, the compositions of CBN-2Tm, CBN-3Tm, and CBN-5Tm with different grain morphologies and piezoelectric properties were selected for spark plasma sintering. These compositions serve as a control group to investigate the factors influencing the properties of the textured ceramics. illustrates the X-ray diffraction patterns of non-textured (CS) and textured (SPS[//] and SPS[\u22a5]) CBN-100xTm ceramics. These patterns closely correspond to the orthorhombic phase (A21 am) of the randomly oriented samples, with no discernible impurity phases. In the case of CS samples with the randomly oriented grains, the diffraction peaks from various crystal planes are observed. However, for the SPS CBN-100xTm samples, the intensity of diffraction peaks corresponding to the same crystal plane varies significantly due to the textured orientation of the grains. In comparison to the patterns of the CS samples, the patterns of the SPS[\u22a5] samples exhibit stronger (00 l) diffraction peaks. Conversely, the SPS[//] samples show no visible (00 l) diffraction peaks but intense (200)/(020), (220), and (315)/(135) diffraction peaks. This indicates that a (00 l) preferred orientation is induced by the two-step spark plasma sintering process. To determine the grain orientation ratio of the sample, the Lotgering factor f can be calculated as follows:  \u2211 I (00l) and \u2211 I (hkl) are the sum of the intensity of all (00 l) and (hkl) peaks in the XRD pattern of textured samples, respectively, and \u2211 I 0(00l) and \u2211 I 0(hkl) are obtained from non-textured samples. As indicated in the top right corner of the figures, the Lotgering factors f of textured CBN-2Tm, CBN-3Tm, and CBN-5Tm are 77.4 %, 69.6 %, and 63.1 %, respectively. To validate the conclusions drawn from the XRD patterns, presents SEM images of thermally etched surfaces of textured (SPS[//] and SPS[\u22a5]) CBN-100xTm ceramics. Similar plate-like grains observed in non-textured ceramics are also visible in the textured ceramics, with their c-axis aligned along the SPS pressure direction, consistent with the XRD findings. Additionally, due to the short holding time during the sintering process, the grain size of the SPS samples is smaller than that of the CS samples of the same composition. In this context, CBN-2Tm exhibits the largest grains with the highest degree of anisotropy, resulting in the greatest texturing. (a) shows the piezoelectric constant d 33 of non-textured (CS) and textured (SPS[//]) CBN-100xTm ceramics. Compared to CS ceramics, the SPS[//] ceramics exhibit significantly enhanced d 33 values, indicating that grain orientation is an effective strategy for achieving high-performance textured piezoelectric ceramics. Textured CBN-2Tm with a Lotgering factor (f) of 77.4% in the SPS[//] samples shows superior piezoelectric performance with a d 33 value of 25.2 pC/N. Textured CBN-3Tm, with an f of 69.6%, achieves a d 33 value of 23.5 pC/N, while textured CBN-5Tm, with an f of 63.1%, displays a d 33 value of 18.0 pC/N. In comparison, shows that the non-textured CS CBN-2Tm, CBN-3Tm, and CBN-5Tm have d 33 values of 11.4 pC/N, 12.4 pC/N, and 9.4 pC/N, respectively. These results highlight an interesting contrast: while CS CBN-3Tm exhibits the highest piezoelectric performance among non-textured samples, textured CBN-2Tm shows the best performance among textured compositions. Specifically, the textured SPS[//] CBN-2Tm ceramic, with the highest degree of texturing (f = 77.4 %), exhibits an optimal piezoelectric constant d 33 of 25.2 pC/N. This value is more than twice that of the CS CBN-2Tm ceramic (11.4 pC/N) and four times that of the CS CBN ceramic (\u223c6.0 pC/N). In contrast, the d 33 value of the SPS[\u22a5] CBN-2Tm ceramic is only 1.50 pC/N, demonstrating significant anisotropy in piezoelectric performance. (b) provides a summary comparing the comprehensive performance (piezoelectric constant d 33 and Curie temperature T C) of textured CBN-2Tm ceramics with previously reported CBN-based ceramics. It is worth noting that achieving both high T C and large d 33 is challenging for CBN-based ceramics prepared by conventional solid-state sintering. However, using texturing techniques to prepare compositionally adjusted CBN ceramics proves to be an effective approach for improving overall performance. Notably, rare-earth thulium-substituted CBN ceramics produced through the two-step spark plasma sintering method exhibit superior piezoelectric performance, with a d 33 value of 25.2 pC/N, demonstrating significant potential for high-temperature piezoelectric sensor applications. To investigate the mechanism behind the enhanced piezoelectric properties in textured CBN-2Tm ceramics, domain configurations of non-textured and textured ceramics were compared using PFM. shows phase and amplitude images of domains within a 15\xd715 \u03bcmE^{2} region for CS, SPS[//], and SPS[\u22a5] CBN-2Tm ceramics, respectively. In the CS sample, domains are visible only in certain regions and are randomly oriented, mirroring the random orientation of its grains. This occurs because some domains, oriented in specific directions, only generate in-plane signals under the applied electric field, making them undetectable by the VPFM (Vertical Piezoresponse Force Microscopy) mode, which captures out-of-plane signals. In the SPS[//] sample, most domains are aligned out of plane due to grain orientation, allowing more domains to respond to the external electric field and thus become visible. Conversely, the SPS[\u22a5] sample shows a relatively weaker signal. Consequently, the SPS[//] sample demonstrates enhanced macroscopic piezoelectric properties compared to the CS sample. Additionally, the domain size in the SPS samples is significantly reduced compared to the CS sample, facilitating domain switching, which will be further confirmed through macroscopic ferroelectric property characterization. This is because the spontaneous polarization of CBN can only switch in the a-b plane due to the limitations of the two-dimensional layered structure. Consequently, applying an electric field in the a-b plane produces a stronger polarization response than applying it along the c-axis. presents the ferroelectric properties, temperature-dependent dielectric properties, temperature-dependent DC electrical resistivity, and thermal depoling behaviors of CS, SPS[//], and SPS[\u22a5] CBN-2Tm ceramics. Consequently, as shown in (a-b), the SPS[//] sample exhibits a more saturated ferroelectric hysteresis loop, with a remanent polarization (2P r) of 21.1 \xb5C/cmE^{2}, which is 2.5 times greater than that of the CS sample (8.4 \xb5C/cmE^{2}). It also has a coercive field (E c) of 109 kV/cm and a notable peak in current density, indicating clear domain switching. In comparison, the CS sample shows an increased E c of 121 kV/cm and a significantly reduced peak current density, suggesting a reduction in the number of switching domains. The SPS[\u22a5] sample, on the other hand, displays a narrower hysteresis loop without a current peak, indicating weak ferroelectricity. Regarding the dielectric properties shown in (c-d), the SPS[//] and SPS[\u22a5] samples exhibit Curie temperatures (T C) similar to that of the CS sample, at 946 and 947 \xb0C, respectively. The SPS[//] sample has the highest dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) over the entire test temperature range, while the SPS[\u22a5] sample has the lowest. However, the dielectric loss tangent (tan\u03b4) is reversed, with the SPS[//] sample exhibiting the highest tan\u03b4 due to the intense response of the polarization to the external electric field, although it remains very low at 2.8 % at 600 \xb0C. (e) compares the variation of DC electrical resistivity with elevated temperature for non-textured and textured CBN-100xTm ceramics. The DC electrical resistivity of the SPS[\u22a5] sample is about an order of magnitude higher than that of the CS sample, especially at high temperatures, because carrier transport along the c-axis is blocked by the natural insulating (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layer. Although the DC electrical resistivity of the SPS[//] sample is lower than that of the SPS[\u22a5] sample, it is as high as 4.7 \xd7 10E^{5} \u03a9 cm at 600 \xb0C, which is a significant improvement over pure CBN and meets device requirements. Regarding the depoling behaviors in (f), the piezoelectric properties of both non-textured and textured samples show excellent thermal stability, with the d 33 of the SPS[//] sample retaining 98 % of its room-temperature value of about 24.7 pC/N at 900 \xb0C. In summary, highly oriented CBN ceramics with excellent comprehensive performance have been successfully prepared by combining A-site substitution and texturing techniques.

# TITLE
Spark plasma sintering of high-T<inf>C</inf> calcium bismuth niobate (CaBi<inf>2</inf>Nb<inf>2</inf>O<inf>9</inf>) with superior piezoelectric performance

# ABSTRACT
Calcium bismuth niobate (CaBi2Nb2O9) is a promising ceramic material for high-temperature piezoelectric applications due to its high Curie temperature (T
                     C) of 940 Â°C. However, its practical use is limited by poor piezoelectric performance and low direct-current (DC) electrical resistivity at elevated temperatures. In this study, we introduced pseudo-tetragonal distortion into CaBi2Nb2O9 by substituting rare-earth thulium ions, which reduced domain wall energy, facilitated domain switching, and decreased the presence of oxygen vacancies. These enhancements significantly improved both the piezoelectric performance and DC electrical resistivity of the material. To further enhance piezoelectric performance, we prepared textured thulium-substituted CaBi2Nb2O9 ceramics with a Lotgering factor (f) of up to 77.4â¯% using a two-step spark plasma sintering method. The resulting textured CaBi2Nb2O9 ceramics exhibited superior piezoelectric performance, with a piezoelectric constant d
                     33 of 25.2 pC/N, four times higher than that of non-textured CaBi2Nb2O9.

# INTRODUCTION
With the rapid development of modern industries, the demand for sensors that can operate at high temperatures (\u223c500 \xb0C or higher) has significantly increased. However, the transition of piezoelectric materials from the ferroelectric-phase to the paraelectric-phase causes a sharp decline in the piezoelectric constant (d 33) as the temperature rises. Bismuth layer-structured ferroelectrics (BLSFs) are considered a promising class of piezoelectric materials for high-temperature sensor applications due to their high T C and excellent thermal stability of piezoelectric properties. Among BLSFs, calcium bismuth niobate (CaBi2Nb2O9, CBN) stands out, boasting the highest T C of approximately 940 \xb0C. CBN also benefits from high electrical resistivity, high mechanical quality factor, and low aging rate, all of which are attributed to its unique layered crystal structure consisting of alternating bismuth-oxide (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layers and perovskite-like (CaNb2O7)E^{2-} slabs along the c-axis. The perovskite-like (CaNb2O7)E^{2-} slab is the source of the ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity of CBN, as its polarization primarily arises from the distortion of NbO6 octahedra within the a-b plane. However, polarization switching in CBN is limited by its two-dimensional layered structure, and the high coercive field (E c) makes achieving excellent piezoelectric performance through artificial poling challenging. That results in a low d 33 value of 6.0 pC/N for pure CBN ceramic. To enhance the piezoelectric performance of CBN ceramic, previous studies have focused on modulating the distortion of (CaNb2O7)E^{2-} blocks through compositional adjustments (A- and/or B-site substitutions). For instance, substituting K/Na/Li and Ce ions at the A-site of CBN increases the rotation of the NbO6 octahedra along the b-axis, inducing a pseudo-tetragonal phase boundary and raising the d 33 value to 15\u201316 pC/N. Additionally, boron ions (BE^{3+}) substitution at the B-site of CBN increases lattice distortion, enhancing both ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties. Grain orientation methods, such as hot-forging, hot-pressing, and spark plasma sintering, have also been employed to improve the piezoelectric properties of BLSFs. For example, Yan et al. prepared highly-grain-oriented textured CBN ceramics, achieving a significant increase in d 33 value (19.5 pC/N), although the DC electrical resistivity was reduced by nearly an order of magnitude. For instance, studies have shown that in both (K,Na)NbO3 and (Ba0.85Ca0.15)(Zr0.1Ti0.9)O3 ceramics, the introduction of Tm induces a structural transition from the orthorhombic phase to a coexistence of orthorhombic and tetragonal phases at room temperature. To achieve these modifications in CBN ceramics, we combined the advantages of A/B-site substitutions and grain orientation techniques, fabricating non-textured, rare-earth thulium-modified CBN ceramics via a solid-phase reaction method, and textured thulium-modified CBN ceramics using a two-step spark plasma sintering (TS-SPS) process. We conducted a detailed investigation into the effects of rare-earth thulium modification on the crystal structure and electrical properties of both non-textured and textured CBN ceramics, identifying the key factors influencing the piezoelectric performance of textured CBN ceramics.

# CONCLUSION
In this study, we prepared CBN-100xTm ceramics using the conventional solid-state sintering method to investigate the effects of compositional adjustments on the crystal structure and electrical properties. XRD analysis revealed that the introduction of Tm ions induces a phase transition from the orthorhombic to the pseudo-tetragonal phase, establishing a phase boundary in the composition of CBN-3Tm. PFM results showed that CBN-3Tm ceramics exhibit stripe-like domains with reduced size and complex distribution, which lowers domain wall energy and facilitates full polarization, resulting in an optimal d 33 of 12.4 pC/N. Additionally, the DC electrical resistivity improved by nearly two orders of magnitude due to the reduction of oxygen vacancies caused by the donor substitution of TmE^{3+} for CaE^{2+}. Subsequently, textured CBN-xTm ceramics were prepared using the SPS two-step sintering method, leveraging the plate-like grain morphology. It was found that the degree of grain orientation, influenced by the grain morphology, and the intrinsic piezoelectric properties together determine the piezoelectric performance of textured CBN-xTm ceramics. As a result, textured CBN-2Tm ceramics, with large aspect ratio grains and high intrinsic piezoelectric properties, achieved an optimal d 33 of 25.2 pC/N. The SPS-prepared sample of CBN-2Tm demonstrated excellent comprehensive performance (2P r = 21.1 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, T C = 946 \u2103, tan\u03b4 = 2.8 % at 600 \xb0C, \u03c1 = 4.7 \xd7 10E^{5} \u03a9\xb7cm at 600 \xb0C, d 33 = 24.7 pC/N after annealing at 900 \u2103), making it a promising candidate for high-temperature piezoelectric device development.
