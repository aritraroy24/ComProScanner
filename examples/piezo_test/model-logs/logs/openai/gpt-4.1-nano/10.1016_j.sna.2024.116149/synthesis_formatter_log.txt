Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'Slicing, electrode painting and firing, poling', 'precursors': ['0.30PIN', '0.40PMN', '0.30PT'], 'steps': ['Slice PIMNT single crystals into wafers measuring 5×5×0.5 mm', 'Paint silver electrodes onto the sample surfaces', 'Fire the samples at 750°C for 30 minutes to form electrodes', 'Pole the samples with an electric field of 10 kV/cm at 140°C for 15 minutes in silicone oil', 'Slowly cool the samples to room temperature while halving the electric field'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'impedance analyzer', 'ferroelectric analyzer', 'd33 meter', 'laser vibrometer']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
