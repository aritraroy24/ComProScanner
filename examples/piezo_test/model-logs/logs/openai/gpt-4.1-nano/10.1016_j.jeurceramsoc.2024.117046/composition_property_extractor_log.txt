# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
As shown in , the permittivity, d31, and d33 characteristics are required to calculate the HFOM characteristics. shows the d31, d33 characteristics and the HFOM characteristics according to PZT volume fraction of composite calculated using FEM. In , d33 and d31 tend to decrease as the porosity increases. As the PZT volume fraction in the composite increases, d33 increases, but d31 tends to decrease. In particular, (a) shows that the d33 value does not change much as the porosity increases from 0 % to 7 %. This is because the d33 value of PZT generally does not vary significantly with porosity. However, as the porosity increases, d31 and permittivity decrease significantly, which ultimately contributes to the increase in the dh and gh values. Additionally, at a porosity of 7 %, the d33 value remains relatively unchanged. This is likely due to the characteristic of PZT, where the d33 value is largely unaffected, and the polymer penetrates into the surface pores, partially suppressing their function as pores. In (b), both d33 and d31 decrease more significantly for porosities greater than 7 %, likely due to the formation of additional internal pores. This is consistent with the previously reported behavior of 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite. However, when the PZT volume fraction exceeds 40 %, d31 tends to increase again, assuming porosity is 0 %. In the 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite, the polymer plays a role in suppressing the lateral action of PZT. As the volume fraction of PZT increases, the lateral action of PZT exceeds the polymer's ability to suppress it beyond a certain volume fraction. This finding is generally consistent with the research results that the HFOM has the maximum value at 15\u201330 % of the PZT rod volume fraction of 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite. Unlike dense PZT (porosity 0 %), the HFOM value of porous PZT increases as the volume fraction of the composite PZT rod increases. This is because the d31 of the composite decreases when porous PZT is used. In the case of a porous PZT rod, it can be seen as a piezoelectric composite with 3\u20133 or 0\u20130 connectivity, which reduces the lateral piezoelectric action of the overall 1\u20133 type composite. Therefore, the d31 value decreases despite a relatively high PZT volume fraction compared to dense PZT. As a result, the effect of d33 (thickness direction action) steadily increases according to the volume fraction, but the effect of d31 (lateral action) steadily decreases due to the additional suppression of the pores inside the porous PZT. This results in a higher HFOM value compared to the dense 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite. As shown in (c), in the case of composites with porosity of 7 % and 13 %, the HFOM value shows a high value of 3000(10E^{\u221215} Pa) or more from 30 % or more of the PZT volume fraction. Also, in (d), the ratios of d33 to d31 increase along with the increase in the PZT ratio of the composite at a porosity of 7 % and13 %. In particular, at 50 % of the PZT volume fraction, the HFOM value shows a high value of about 4000(10E^{\u221215} Pa). However, as the volume fraction of PZT increases in the fabricating process, there is a risk of internal defects in the green body due to increased friction with the mold and deformation during sintering, which increases the cost of the process. Therefore, in this study, the PZT volume fraction was determined to be 30 % In the 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite, the aspect ratio of the PZT rod greatly influences the coupling factor in thickness direction (kt), which directly affects warpage during sintering or piezoelectric conversion efficiency Therefore, it is important to select the aspect ratio of the PZT rod for the design of the 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite. Based on the PZT volume fraction (30 %) of the composite selected in , the aspect ratio of the PZT rod was varied, and the corresponding kt value was calculated with following equation;  shows the amount of change in the kt value according to the aspect ratio. When the porosity is 0 % and 7 %, the aspect ratio increases rapidly between 3 and 4 and gradually increases without a significant change above 5. However, when the porosity is 13 %, the kt value gradually increases without a radical change and converges when the aspect ratio is 4. It seems that the piezoelectric effect (subscript t) in the thickness direction of the composite becomes closer to the longitudinal direction (subscript 33) because the propensity of each PZT rod becomes closer to the LE mode as the aspect ratio increases. In addition, for single phase porous PZT ceramics, the kt value is known to increase as porosity increases. As shown in , for porous 1\u20133 PZT-polymer composites, the kt value rises up to a porosity of 7 %, following the trend observed in previous studies, but it suddenly decreases at 13 % porosity. This is because, in the case of porous PZT, only air or voids exist in the pores, which does not affect the connectivity of the PZT. However, in porous 1\u20133 PZT-polymer composites, the polymer penetrates the open pores of the PZT, reducing its connectivity, which increases impedance and decreases the frequency bandwidth in the thickness direction. Therefore, in composites with 7 % or more porosity, the polymer that infiltrates the open pores extending to the surface or interior is likely to affect piezoelectric performance. Therefore, for the shape to be used in this study, the PZT volume fraction is set to 30 %, and the aspect ratio is set to 4 according to the results of. shows the microstructure of green body of porous 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite preform. Based on the observed microstructure, it is evident that polystyrene (PS) does not melt and retains its original shape well, even when injection is performed at a relatively high temperature (approximately 180\u2103). This phenomenon is similar to that of PMMA, which is used as a medium for pore generation when fabricating bulk-type specimens through the press process. As expected, PS has a higher melting point than PMMA and is therefore expected to maintain its shape even at high temperatures during injection. shows the microstructure of sintered porous 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite preform. From , it is evident that the PS retained its shape sufficiently and burned out during the sintering process, resulting in successful pore formation. This can be attributed to the fact that PS has a higher boiling point (430\u2103) compared to other paraffin wax (300\u2103) and EVA (170\u2103) used in the feedstock. The size of the pores observed on the microstructure was \u223c30 \xb5m on average, and it can be seen that they have a uniform size without significant differences depending on the porosity. The hydrostatic properties (dh, gh) of the fabricated specimen were analyzed using a dh-meter (PM-300H, Piezotest), with providing a schematic of the measuring device. The measurement works by applying 110 Hz low-frequency air pressure to a specimen sealed in a container, recording the internal charge produced, and determining the values for dh and the dielectric constant. shows a micro porous PZT rod of the fabricated piezoelectric composite. Each composite was fabricated with PZT rod porosity of 0, 3, 5, 8, 10 and 12, and its characteristics are shown in in comparison with simulation calculation results. In the case of the fabricated porous 1\u20133type PZT-polymer composite, the HFOM value is the highest at 4050(10\u201315 Pa) at 12 % porosity, and the result increases as the porosity increases. In addition, the HFOM values obtained by the experiment show the same tendency as the simulation calculation result as a whole, but show a slight error in the absolute value over the porosity of 5 %. The simulation and experimental results showed a difference of about 12\u201317 % from porosity of 7\u201313 %. This is presumed to be because the material properties of the actual porous PZT rod were changed as the polymer penetrated the surface of the porous PZT rod. In addition, the material properties used for simulation in this study were obtained by assuming equivalent material properties in bulk shape specimens without considering the actual pore size and shape of porous PZT. Therefore, in the case of a 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite with a large aspect ratio and a large number of rods, it is highly likely that the pores in the PZT rods are distributed in more diverse shapes and sizes. Considering these variables, it is judged that the predicted and designed values through simulation and the properties of the actually fabricated 1\u20133 type piezoelectric composite show an acceptable degree of error. In addition, it was confirmed that a porous 1\u20133type PZT-polymer composite with a relatively higher HFOM value than the existing 1\u20133type PZT-polymer composite was successfully fabricated.

# TITLE
Improved hydrostatic piezoelectric property via incorporation of porous PZT ceramics into 1â3 type PZT-polymer composites: Design to fabrication

# ABSTRACT
PZT ceramic is widely used as sensors, especially in underwater applications like sound navigation and ranging(SONAR), due to its piezoelectric properties. However, single-phase PZT ceramics have poor hydrostatic piezoelectric properties, leading to the development of porous PZT and PZT-polymer composites. This study enhanced the hydrostatic figure of merit(HFOM) value by incorporating porous PZT into a 1â3 type composite. Finite element analysis and the ceramic injection molding(CIM) method were used for optimal design and fabrication. PZflex simulation tool derived the composite's piezoelectric properties, revealing that increased porosity reduced d33 and d31 but increased HFOM. The aspect ratio of PZT rods was selected by calculating the coupling factor. The fabricated composite had a higher HFOM value (4050(10â15â¯Pa) at 12â¯% porosity) than dense 1â3 type PZT-polymer composites. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of finite element analysis and CIM in designing high-performance piezoelectric composites, with potential for various future applications.

# INTRODUCTION
PZT ceramic is a representative piezoelectric material utilized in various sensors and actuators. Particularly in the context of piezoelectric sensors utilized underwater such as Sound Navigation And Ranging (SONAR), there exists a demand for superior hydrostatic properties, encompassing the hydrostatic piezoelectric constants(dh, gh), and HFOM (hydrostatic figure of merit). Nevertheless, single-phase PZT piezoelectric ceramics exhibit the limitation of possessing inferior hydrostatic piezoelectric properties. A representative example is the porous PZT ceramics and PZT-polymer composite, which have micro pores in ceramics or arranges PZT rods and polymers in composite forms, respectively. W.Liu et.al improve the HFOM value of PZT-5H ceramics by manufacturing porous PZT 5 H ceramics through an ionotropic gelation process. Gururaja et al. attempted to increase the HFOM value of composites in various shapes, such as 3\u20133, 1\u20133, 1\u20133\u20130, 0\u20133, 3\u20131, and 3\u20132, by using different polymers based on the arrangement of the composite  Among them, 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite is widely used as a sensor due to its characteristics such as high sensitivity and improved impedance match to water, and its HFOM characteristics are known to be about 2000 (10E^{\u221215} Pa). If the volume fraction of polymer in 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite is increased, d 33 shows characteristics close to piezoelectric ceramics, and permittivity and d 31 can be reduced. Finally, as shown in the following equations  An increase in d33 and a decrease in d31leads to an increase in d h according to equation 20, and a decrease in permittivity leads to an increase in g h. As a result, it sequentially leads to an increase in hydrostatic figure of merit (HFOM) value. So type1\u20133 PZT-polymer composite is advantageous to increase the hydrostatic piezoelectric constant. However, there are limits to improving these characteristics solely by reducing the volume fraction of the PZT ceramics through the arrangement of the PZT rods. Furthermore, as the length of the PZT rod in a composite increases, the coupling factor in thickness direction (kt) of the composite generally increases, but this also leads to an increase in deformation during sintering, making the design, fabricating and optimization process more challenging. Additionally, as both the aspect ratio and the length of the PZT rod increase, the likelihood of residual stress gradients further increases, which can also cause deformation during sintering. In this study, we aimed to further improve the hydrostatic properties by applying porous PZT to 1\u20133 type piezoelectric composite. To accomplish this, the hydrostatic piezoelectric characteristics were predicted and designed using an FEM-based simulation for the application of porous PZT to the 1\u20133 type piezoelectric composite. Subsequently, the existing porous PZT fabricating method was employed in the ceramic injection molding process to produce the designed piezoelectric composite. The hydrostatic piezoelectric properties of the finally produced porous PZT 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite were sought to be verified by comparing them with the simulation results.

# CONCLUSION
In this study, the HFOM value was enhanced by incorporating porous PZT into a 1\u20133 type piezoelectric composite. The finite element analysis method was employed for optimal design, and the CIM method was utilized for composite fabrication. The simulation for derive the piezoelectric properties of 1\u20133 type piezoelectric composites was conducted using PZflex software, a finite element analysis program. The hydrostatic response of the porous 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite was calculated by analyzing its permittivity, d31, and d33 characteristics which were obtained from simulated impedance characteristics. The results showed that as the porosity of the composite increased, d33 and d31 tended to decrease, and the HFOM value increased. The results also confirm that the aspect ratio of the PZT rod greatly influenced the coupling factor in thickness direction (kt) in 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composites, which affects sintering warpage and piezoelectric conversion efficiency. The microstructure of the green body and sintered porous 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite preform was examined, and it was observed that the use of polystyrene (PS) for pore generation allowed for the formation of uniform pores of \u223c30 \xb5m size on average. It suggests that the predicted and designed values through simulation and the properties of the actually fabricated composite show an acceptable degree of error, and a porous 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite with a relatively higher HFOM value (4050(10E^{\u221215} Pa) at 12 % porosity) than the existing 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite was successfully fabricated. In conclusion, the above results demonstrate the potential of designing and fabricating high-performance porous PZT-polymer composites using finite element analysis and Ceramic Injection Molding. Specifically, it is anticipated that higher HFOM characteristics could be attained by employing soft series piezoelectric ceramics in future applications.

Therefore, for the shape to be used in this study, the PZT volume fraction is set to 30 %, and the aspect ratio is set to 4 according to the results of. shows the microstructure of green body of porous 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite preform. Based on the observed microstructure, it is evident that polystyrene (PS) does not melt and retains its original shape well, even when injection is performed at a relatively high temperature (approximately 180\u2103). This phenomenon is similar to that of PMMA, which is used as a medium for pore generation when fabricating bulk-type specimens through the press process. As expected, PS has a higher melting point than PMMA and is therefore expected to maintain its shape even at high temperatures during injection. shows the microstructure of sintered porous 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite preform. From , it is evident that the PS retained its shape sufficiently and burned out during the sintering process, resulting in successful pore formation. This can be attributed to the fact that PS has a higher boiling point (430\u2103) compared to other paraffin wax (300\u2103) and EVA (170\u2103) used in the feedstock. The size of the pores observed on the microstructure was \u223c30 \xb5m on average, and it can be seen that they have a uniform size without significant differences depending on the porosity. The hydrostatic properties (dh, gh) of the fabricated specimen were analyzed using a dh-meter (PM-300H, Piezotest), with providing a schematic of the measuring device. The measurement works by applying 110 Hz low-frequency air pressure to a specimen sealed in a container, recording the internal charge produced, and determining the values for dh and the dielectric constant. shows a micro porous PZT rod of the fabricated piezoelectric composite. Each composite was fabricated with PZT rod porosity of 0, 3, 5, 8, 10 and 12, and its characteristics are shown in in comparison with simulation calculation results. In the case of the fabricated porous 1\u20133type PZT-polymer composite, the HFOM value is the highest at 4050(10\u201315 Pa) at 12 % porosity, and the result increases as the porosity increases. In addition, the HFOM values obtained by the experiment show the same tendency as the simulation calculation result as a whole, but show a slight error in the absolute value over the porosity of 5 %. The simulation and experimental results showed a difference of about 12\u201317 % from porosity of 7\u201313 %. This is presumed to be because the material properties of the actual porous PZT rod were changed as the polymer penetrated the surface of the porous PZT rod. In addition, the material properties used for simulation in this study were obtained by assuming equivalent material properties in bulk shape specimens without considering the actual pore size and shape of porous PZT. Therefore, in the case of a 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite with a large aspect ratio and a large number of rods, it is highly likely that the pores in the PZT rods are distributed in more diverse shapes and sizes. Considering these variables, it is judged that the predicted and designed values through simulation and the properties of the actually fabricated 1\u20133 type piezoelectric composite show an acceptable degree of error. In addition, it was confirmed that a porous 1\u20133type PZT-polymer composite with a relatively higher HFOM value than the existing 1\u20133type PZT-polymer composite was successfully fabricated.

# TITLE
Improved hydrostatic piezoelectric property via incorporation of porous PZT ceramics into 1â3 type PZT-polymer composites: Design to fabrication

# ABSTRACT
PZT ceramic is widely used as sensors, especially in underwater applications like sound navigation and ranging(SONAR), due to its piezoelectric properties. However, single-phase PZT ceramics have poor hydrostatic piezoelectric properties, leading to the development of porous PZT and PZT-polymer composites. This study enhanced the hydrostatic figure of merit(HFOM) value by incorporating porous PZT into a 1â3 type composite. Finite element analysis and the ceramic injection molding(CIM) method were used for optimal design and fabrication. PZflex simulation tool derived the composite's piezoelectric properties, revealing that increased porosity reduced d33 and d31 but increased HFOM. The aspect ratio of PZT rods was selected by calculating the coupling factor. The fabricated composite had a higher HFOM value (4050(10â15â¯Pa) at 12â¯% porosity) than dense 1â3 type PZT-polymer composites. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of finite element analysis and CIM in designing high-performance piezoelectric composites, with potential for various future applications.

# INTRODUCTION
PZT ceramic is a representative piezoelectric material utilized in various sensors and actuators. Particularly in the context of piezoelectric sensors utilized underwater such as Sound Navigation And Ranging (SONAR), there exists a demand for superior hydrostatic properties, encompassing the hydrostatic piezoelectric constants(dh, gh), and HFOM (hydrostatic figure of merit). Nevertheless, single-phase PZT piezoelectric ceramics exhibit the limitation of possessing inferior hydrostatic piezoelectric properties. A representative example is the porous PZT ceramics and PZT-polymer composite, which have micro pores in ceramics or arranges PZT rods and polymers in composite forms, respectively. W.Liu et.al improve the HFOM value of PZT-5H ceramics by manufacturing porous PZT 5 H ceramics through an ionotropic gelation process. Gururaja et al. attempted to increase the HFOM value of composites in various shapes, such as 3\u20133, 1\u20133, 1\u20133\u20130, 0\u20133, 3\u20131, and 3\u20132, by using different polymers based on the arrangement of the composite  Among them, 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite is widely used as a sensor due to its characteristics such as high sensitivity and improved impedance match to water, and its HFOM characteristics are known to be about 2000 (10E^{\u221215} Pa). If the volume fraction of polymer in 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite is increased, d 33 shows characteristics close to piezoelectric ceramics, and permittivity and d 31 can be reduced. Finally, as shown in the following equations  An increase in d33 and a decrease in d31leads to an increase in d h according to equation 20, and a decrease in permittivity leads to an increase in g h. As a result, it sequentially leads to an increase in hydrostatic figure of merit (HFOM) value. So type1\u20133 PZT-polymer composite is advantageous to increase the hydrostatic piezoelectric constant. However, there are limits to improving these characteristics solely by reducing the volume fraction of the PZT ceramics through the arrangement of the PZT rods. Furthermore, as the length of the PZT rod in a composite increases, the coupling factor in thickness direction (kt) of the composite generally increases, but this also leads to an increase in deformation during sintering, making the design, fabricating and optimization process more challenging. Additionally, as both the aspect ratio and the length of the PZT rod increase, the likelihood of residual stress gradients further increases, which can also cause deformation during sintering. In this study, we aimed to further improve the hydrostatic properties by applying porous PZT to 1\u20133 type piezoelectric composite. To accomplish this, the hydrostatic piezoelectric characteristics were predicted and designed using an FEM-based simulation for the application of porous PZT to the 1\u20133 type piezoelectric composite. Subsequently, the existing porous PZT fabricating method was employed in the ceramic injection molding process to produce the designed piezoelectric composite. The hydrostatic piezoelectric properties of the finally produced porous PZT 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite were sought to be verified by comparing them with the simulation results.

# CONCLUSION
In this study, the HFOM value was enhanced by incorporating porous PZT into a 1\u20133 type piezoelectric composite. The finite element analysis method was employed for optimal design, and the CIM method was utilized for composite fabrication. The simulation for derive the piezoelectric properties of 1\u20133 type piezoelectric composites was conducted using PZflex software, a finite element analysis program. The hydrostatic response of the porous 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite was calculated by analyzing its permittivity, d31, and d33 characteristics which were obtained from simulated impedance characteristics. The results showed that as the porosity of the composite increased, d33 and d31 tended to decrease, and the HFOM value increased. The results also confirm that the aspect ratio of the PZT rod greatly influenced the coupling factor in thickness direction (kt) in 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composites, which affects sintering warpage and piezoelectric conversion efficiency. The microstructure of the green body and sintered porous 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite preform was examined, and it was observed that the use of polystyrene (PS) for pore generation allowed for the formation of uniform pores of \u223c30 \xb5m size on average. It suggests that the predicted and designed values through simulation and the properties of the actually fabricated composite show an acceptable degree of error, and a porous 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite with a relatively higher HFOM value (4050(10E^{\u221215} Pa) at 12 % porosity) than the existing 1\u20133 type PZT-polymer composite was successfully fabricated. In conclusion, the above results demonstrate the potential of designing and fabricating high-performance porous PZT-polymer composites using finite element analysis and Ceramic Injection Molding. Specifically, it is anticipated that higher HFOM characteristics could be attained by employing soft series piezoelectric ceramics in future applications.
