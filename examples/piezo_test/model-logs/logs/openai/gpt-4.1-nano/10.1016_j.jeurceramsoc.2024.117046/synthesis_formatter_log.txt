Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'Ceramic injection molding (CIM)', 'precursors': ['KICET-PZT8', 'paraffin wax', 'ethylene-vinyl-acetate'], 'steps': ['Preparation of feedstock by mixing KICET-PZT8 powder with paraffin wax and EVA to form a ceramic injection molding feedstock.', 'Fabrication of preform using CIM machine (NEX-500, NISSEI Japan) with the prepared feedstock and mold.', 'Sintering of the PZT composite preform at 1250°C for 2 hours.', 'Pouring of polymer (EPOTEK 301) into the sintered preform.', 'Curing of polymer-poured specimens at 80°C for 12 hours.', 'Machining of final specimens into optimized shapes based on simulation results.', 'Application of room-temperature-curing silver electrodes onto the specimens.', 'Polarization by applying an electric field of 2.5 kV/mm for 20 minutes in a silicone oil bath at 120°C.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'SEM', 'dh-meter']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
