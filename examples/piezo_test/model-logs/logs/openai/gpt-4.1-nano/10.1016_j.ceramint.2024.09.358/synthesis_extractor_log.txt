High-temperature solid-state reaction method was used for the synthesis of Ba0.92Ca0.08Zr0.09Ti0.91O3 (BCZT) and Ba0.92Ca0.08Sn0.09Ti0.91O3 (BCST) ceramics. To begin with, stoichiometric ratios of high-purity precursors, including BaCO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9 %), CaCO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9 %), ZrO2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9 %), SnO2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9 %), and TiO2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9 %) were mixed. After 2 h of grinding in a mortar and pestle, the combinations were milled for 4 h in an ethanol solution with zirconia balls in a low-energy ball mill. The resulting solutions were dried and the obtained lumps were pulverized and calcined for 4 h at 1200 \xb0C in air ambient. The resulting granulated powders of BCZT and BCST ceramics were reground and molded into disk-shaped pellets (1 mm thick and 10 mm in diameter) with the addition of 1 wt % polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as an organic binder. To burn off the PVA binder, the pellets were first heated for 1 h at 650 \xb0C at a rate of 1 \xb0C per minute. Subsequently, the binder-free pellets of both compounds underwent simultaneous sintering for 4 h at 1400 \xb0C in air. The phase purity of the sintered pellets was examined in a 2\u03b8 range from 20\xb0 to 80\xb0 using the PANalytical Empyrean X-ray diffractometer (XRD) equipped with Cu K \u03b1 (\u03bb = 1.5405 \xc5) radiation. The XRD patterns thus obtained were Rietveld refined using the FULLPROF software. The crystal structures were visualized using the VESTA software. The surface morphology and elemental composition of the sintered samples were analyzed using a high-resolution Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM,7610F Plus/JEOL) attached with Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The dielectric constant and tangent loss at various frequencies (100Hz - 10 kHz) and temperatures, ranging from 30 \xb0C to 150 \xb0C were measured using a programmable furnace equipped with an Alpha-A high-performance modular measurement system from Novocontrol Technologies, Germany. The piezoelectric measurements were performed at room temperature utilizing an Autocal 230 \xb0C Piezoelectric Test Chamber coupled with a Radiant Multiferroic tester. The absorbance measurements covering a wavelength range of 200 nm\u2013800 nm were carried out at room temperature using a Cary 5000 UV\u2013vis\u2013NIR spectrophotometer.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a) shows the room temperature X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of BCZT and BCST ceramics. These patterns reveal distinctive peaks that indicate a perovskite structure, devoid of any impurities, confirming the successful incorporation of CaE^{2+}, ZrE^{4+}, and SnE^{4+} ions into the BaTiO3 lattice. The characteristic peaks correspond to the established BaTiO3 diffraction patterns outlined in the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) files #79\u20132264 and #81\u20132200, representing the tetragonal (T) and orthorhombic (O) phases of the BaTiO3 ceramic, respectively, The Gaussian fitting of the peaks at 2\u03b8 \u2248 45\xb0, as illustrated in (b), also corroborate the coexistence of tetragonal (T) and orthorhombic (O) phases in the studied ceramics. The result of Rietveld refinement performed against the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of BCZT and BCST ceramics is depicted in (c\u2013d), respectively. From the refinement, it can be deduced that there exists a coexistence of tetragonal (T, P4mm) and orthorhombic (O, Amm2) phases. The BCZT ceramic comprises 55.18 wt% tetragonal phase and 44.82 wt% orthorhombic phase, while the BCST ceramic contains 48.10 wt% tetragonal phase and 51.90 wt% orthorhombic phase. The discrepancy in the phase distribution between BCZT and BCST may likely be attributed to the difference in ionic radii between ZrE^{4+} (0.72 \xc5) and SnE^{4+} (0.69 \xc5) ions. ZrE^{4+}, having a larger ionic radius in comparison to that of TiE^{4+} (0.605 \xc5), causes a greater elongation along the c-axis, leading to an enhanced lattice distortion. This increased distortion stabilizes the tetragonal symmetry, which is further supported by a higher c/a ratio observed in BCZT compound. Consequently, BCZT exhibits a higher proportion of the tetragonal phase. In contrast, SnE^{4+} ion, though slightly larger than TiE^{4+} ion, is smaller than ZrE^{4+} ion, results in lesser lattice distortion. This distortion favors the stabilization of the orthorhombic phase, explaining the higher orthorhombic phase percentage in BCST compound. The lattice parameters (a, b, c) obtained from the XRD refinement are presented in , which also encompasses the lattice volume (V) and goodness of fit (\u03c7 E^{2}) values for both compounds. The changes in unit cell volume from the parent lattice confirm the successful incorporation of CaE^{2+}, ZrE^{4+}, SnE^{4+} into BaTiO3 lattice. The increase in the unit cell volume of BCZT (64.74 \xc5\xb3 in tetragonal phase and 129.24 \xc5\xb3 in orthorhombic phase) compared to that of the parent BaTiO3 lattice (64.28 \xc5\xb3 in tetragonal phase and 128.76 \xc5\xb3 in orthorhombic phase) can be attributed to a larger ionic radius of ZrE^{4+} (0.72 \xc5) ion compared to that of TiE^{4+}(0.605 \xc5) ion. Conversely, in case of BCST, the unit cell volume (64.18 \xc5\xb3 in the tetragonal phase and 126.27 \xc5\xb3 in the orthorhombic phase) decreases in comparison to that of BaTiO3 despite the doping of SnE^{4+} (0.69 \xc5), which has a larger radius than TiE^{4+} ion. This discrepancy may be attributed to a significantly higher effective electron affinity of Sn (107.3 kJ/mol) when compared with that of Ti (7.6 kJ/mol). Further, it is also clear from that the BCZT ceramic exhibits a higher tetragonality ratio (c/a) in comparison to that of BCST ceramic. The bulk density of the ceramics was determined using the Archimedes' principle, providing values of 5.91 g cmE^{\u22123} and 5.80 g cmE^{\u22123} for BCZT and BCST ceramics, respectively. In terms of relative density, the BCZT ceramic has a density of 98.17 %, and the BCST ceramic has a density of 96.34 %. A higher density of BCZT indicates better dielectric and piezoelectric properties. presents the atomic coordinates for both BCZT and BCST ceramics. From there, it can be inferred that CaE^{2+} ions are substituted at BaE^{2+} site, while ZrE^{4+} and SnE^{4+} ions occupy the TiE^{4+} site in BCZT and BCST ceramics as confirmed from the similar Wyckoff positions. The VESTA software generated crystal structures of the BCZT and BCST compounds, as shown in the insets of (c\u2013d), using the parameters from and 2 The Fourier subprogram in FULLPROF was used to calculate the scattering density inside the unit cell of the ceramics. The application of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) as a subroutine was used to speed up the calculation of the given expression. where, V represents the volume of the unit cell, H is the reciprocal lattice vector, r denotes the vector position within the unit cell, and F(H) corresponds to the complex Fourier coefficients employed for various Fourier transform operations. The unit of \u03c1(r) is determined by dividing the unit of F(H) by the unit of V. The electron density within the unit cell was determined and the same is illustrated in (a\u2013b) which suggests that the BCZT ceramic exhibits a higher electron density compared to that of BCST ceramic. ZrE^{4+} has a different electron distribution compared to SnE^{4+}. ZrE^{4+}, with its [Kr] 4 dE^{2} electronic configuration, tends to contribute more to the electron density in the crystal structure. On the other hand, SnE^{4+} ion, with a [Kr] 5sE^{2} 4 dE^{1}\u2070 configuration, does not influence the electron density as strongly. The higher electron density in BCZT can thus be attributed to the nature of the ZrE^{4+} ion's electron cloud and its interaction with surrounding atoms. At room temperature, both BCZT and BCST compounds exhibit dual-phase crystal structures. The FESEM images of sintered BCZT and BCST ceramics are shown in (a\u2013b). The BCZT ceramic shows the existence of more number of larger grains than those in the BCST compound. The disparity in grain size between the two compounds is also corroborated by the histograms shown in (c\u2013d) for the BCZT and BCST compounds, respectively. The histograms show a grain size distribution curve, indicating that a greater number of grains fall within the range of 3\u20134 \u03bcm for BCZT ceramic and 1\u20132 \u03bcm for BCST ceramic. (e\u2013f) displays the elemental composition of the ceramics as determined from the EDX analysis. The theoretical and experimental atomic percentages (at. %) of the constituent elements in the ceramics are presented in the insets of (e\u2013f). In BCZT ceramics, the experimental atomic ratios of Ba/Ca and Ti/Zr are found to be 11.66 and 10.98, respectively. For comparison, the Ba/Ca and Ti/Sn ratios in BCST ceramics are 11.94 and 9.54, respectively. Theoretical atomic ratios Ba/Ca and Ti/Zr or Ti/Sn are 11.5 and 10.11, respectively, revealing a fair match. Additional peaks appear in both EDX spectra at about 2.1 and 9.1 keV, indicating the presence of gold used to coat the samples for measurement. (a\u2013d) illustrates the temperature dependent dielectric constant (\u025b) and loss tangent (tan\u03b4) of BCZT and BCST compounds at different frequencies (0.1, 1, 5, and 10 KHz). (a) demonstrates that the BCZT compound undergoes two distinct phase transitions; the first from orthorhombic to tetragonal at temperature (T O-T) \u223c 52 \xb0C, and the second from tetragonal to cubic at the Curie temperature (T C) \u223c 105 \xb0C. In contrast, in (b), the BCST compound exhibits a single-phase transition from tetragonal to cubic phase at T C \u223c 70 \xb0C, a significantly lower temperature compared to that of BCZT ceramic. It is a well-established fact that substitution of SnE^{4+} ion at TiE^{4+} site in BT-based ceramics reduces the T C at much faster rate when compared to the substitution of ZrE^{4+} ion at TiE^{4+} site. Literature also confirms that substituting SnE^{4+} ion at TiE^{4+} site in BT-based ceramics reduces the phase transition temperatures. This can be understood as SnE^{4+} has a more isotropic electron cloud due to its electronic configuration ([Kr] 5sE^{2} 4 dE^{1}), which reduces the overall polarization of the material. Since T C is linked to the strength of the dipole-dipole interactions within the material, lower polarization caused by SnE^{4}\u207asubstitution weakens these interactions and decreases T C more significantly. Since the Rietveld refinement indicates presence of two phases in BCST ceramic, we confirmed this by taking the derivative of the dielectric constant at 0.1 kHz. The inset of depicts the derivate of the dielectric constant-versus temperature graph of BCST compound from where a noticeable hump near room temperature can be noticed. This attests a phase transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic phase in BCST compound near room temperature. Dielectric loss tangent (tan\u03b4) refers to the dissipation of energy that occurs when the polarization lags behind the applied electric field. The variation of tan\u03b4 with temperature at different frequencies is shown in (c\u2013d) for the studied compounds. The tan\u03b4 values for the compounds are maximum near the high-temperature dielectric peaks. The peak dielectric maximum (\u03b5m) and tan\u03b4 near the Curie temperature are \u223c13304 and \u223c0.06 for BCZT, and \u223c12112 and \u223c0.15 for BCST compound at 1 KHz applied frequency. Above 125 \xb0C, the dispersion in tan\u03b4 may be attributed to the predominance of the grain boundaries' influence in comparison to the grains. The formation of polar nano-regions (PNRs) may be responsible for the transition of the material from a normal ferroelectric to a relaxor ferroelectric. For this, Uchino and Nomura proposed a modified version of the Curie-Weiss law. where, T represents the temperature, C denotes the Curie\u2013Weiss constant, and the relaxation degree represented by \u03b3 (1 < \u03b3 < 2) characterizes the ferroelectric nature. The value of \u03b3 is 1 for regular ferroelectrics and 2 for optimal relaxor ferroelectrics. (a\u2013b) displays the relationship between the log ( 1\u025b\u2212 1 \u025bm) against log ( T\u2212 Tm) at a frequency of 1 kHz. The \u03b3 values observed for BCZT and BCST ceramics are 1.59 and 1.62, respectively. Although these values indicate that neither BCZT nor BCST ceramic exhibit strong relaxor behavior, their \u03b3 values being above 1 suggest the presence of slight relaxor characteristics. The hysteresis loops measurements depicting the percentage strain versus electric field and conducted up to a maximum field intensity of 20 kV cmE^{\u22121} and applied frequency of 10 Hz for the BCZT and BCST compounds are shown in (a\u2013b). The determined d33\u2217 values are \u223c609 p.m. VE^{\u22121} for BCZT and \u223c358 p.m. VE^{\u22121} for BCST ceramic. Despite exhibiting greater relaxor behavior, the BCST compound possesses a lower d33\u2217 value when compared with that of BCZT ceramic. This difference is due to a lower tetragonality ratio (1.0034) and bulk density (5.80 g cmE^{\u2212}\xb3) for the former than the tetragonality ratio (1.0051) and bulk density (5.91 g cmE^{\u2212}\xb3) for the latter compound. The superior d33\u2217 value of BCZT ceramic may also be attributed to its higher percentage of the tetragonal phase. Among the various phases present in BT-based ceramics, the tetragonal phase provides the highest piezoelectricity due to its highly asymmetric nature. Furthermore, the smaller grain size in BCST ceramic could lead to domain wall pinning by grain boundaries, resulting in reduced piezoelectricity in this compound. The pyroelectric coefficient (p= \u0394 Ps \u0394T) for the studied compounds was determined from the slope of a graph between the spontaneous polarization (Ps) and temperature (T). The graphs are shown in (a\u2013b). The pyroelectric coefficient exhibits its peak values at specific temperature intervals: 342\u2013368 K for BCZT compound, reaching \u22121861.9 \u03bcCmE^{-2} KE^{\u22121}, and 322\u2013343 K for BCST ceramic with a value of \u22122482.2 \u03bcCmE^{-2} KE^{\u22121}. Further, at lower temperatures (312\u2013337 K for BCZT and 347\u2013368 K for BCST), the pyroelectric coefficient remains substantial (\u22121396.9 \u03bcCmE^{-2} KE^{\u22121} for BCZT and \u22121794.0 \u03bcCmE^{-2} KE^{\u22121} for BCST), indicating the persistence of the ferroelectric behaviour. However, at higher temperatures (372\u2013393 K for BCZT and 347\u2013368 K for BCST), the pyroelectric coefficient sharply falls (\u221265.6 \u03bcCmE^{-2} KE^{\u22121} for BCZT and \u221267.8 \u03bcCmE^{-2} KE^{\u22121} for BCST). Furthermore, the comparison between BCZT and BCST reveals that BCZT exhibits a lower pyroelectric coefficient. This is because BCZT contains more acceptor ion dopants, particularly ZrE^{4+}. The enhanced pyroelectric coefficient observed in BCST suggests its potential for a higher electrocaloric effect, indicating its suitability for applications requiring efficient temperature-induced polarization changes. The enhanced pyroelectric coefficient observed in BCST suggests a higher electrocaloric effect in this compound. Each ferroelectric material possesses a distinct hysteresis loop (P-E loop) between electric polarization and applied electric field from which one can determine key parameters such as spontaneous polarization (Ps), remnant polarization (Pr), and coercive field (Ec). compares the room-temperature hysteresis loops of the BCZT and BCST compounds. From there, one may observe that the P-E loop for BCST is narrower than that of BCZT due to the presence of polar nanoregions and the ensuing relaxor behaviour in the former compound. The values of Pr (11.92 \u03bcC cmE^{\u22122}) and Ec (1.11 kV cmE^{\u22121}) in the BCST sample are lower than that of the BCZT compound (15.76 \u03bcC cmE^{\u22122} & 1.45 kV cmE^{\u22121}). However, the Pmax value (46.85 \u03bcC cmE^{\u22122}) in the BCST is larger than the Pmax value of BCZT (37.06 \u03bcC cmE^{\u22122}). Further, (b\u2013c) illustrates P-E loops at different temperatures for both BCZT and BCST ceramics. It can be noticed that as the temperature rises, the P\u2013E loops become narrower, and there is a gradual decrease in Pr, Ec, and Pmax values for both materials, which is a well-known fact. At temperatures above Tc (\u223c105 \xb0C for BCZT and \u223c70 \xb0C for BCST), the P-E loops exhibit a behaviour reminiscent of a paraelectric phase. The total energy density (W tot) and recoverable energy density (W rec), as well as the efficiency (\u03b7), of the studied compounds were determined by analyzing the P-E hysteresis loops using the following equations : It is important to remember that achieving high energy storage densities and efficiency in relaxor ferroelectric based-ceramics relies on optimizing the electrical breakdown strength, polarization, dielectric constant, and dielectric loss. (e\u2013f) illustrates the changes in the energy storage capacity of BCZT and BCST ceramics when subjected to thermal variation at an electric field strength of 20 kV cmE^{\u22121}. At 35 \xb0C, the values of W tot, W rec, and \u03b7 are 201, 127 mJcmE^{\u22123}, and 63.18 % for BCZT; and 261, 191.8 mJcmE^{\u22123}, and 73.26 % for BCST. The increased energy storage capability of the BCST compound can be attributed to a higher charge storage density (Q c = Pmax - P r ) owing to its smaller grain size and an enhanced relaxor behaviour. Near Tc, the values of W tot, W rec, and \u03b7 are 164.4 mJ cmE^{\u22123}, 152.0 mJ cmE^{\u22123}, and 92.41 % for BCZT; and 189.68 mJ cmE^{\u22123}, 164.27 mJ cmE^{\u22123}, and 88.68 % for BCST compound. The breakdown electric field (E b ) for BCZT and BCST ceramics can be estimated with the following Weibull distribution function. where, i, n, and Ei represent the serial number of each ceramic, the total number of compounds, and the breakdown electric field of the ceramic in ascending order, respectively. As shown in (a), the linear relationship between xi and yi for all samples demonstrates m value greater than 10, confirming the reliability of the breakdown electric field (Eb) for both ceramics. The P d is calculated using the equation  where f represents the frequency of the AC signal. The calculated Pd values for BCZT and BCST ceramics near room temperature (35 \xb0C) and at their respective Curie temperatures (T C ) are shown in (b). The electrocaloric effect (ECE) articulates the change in isothermal entropy or adiabatic temperature of a dielectric substance when an electric field is applied or removed. depicts a schematic representation of the ECE cooling cycle, which consists of four distinct phases (A-D). During the first stage of the cooling cycle, the polar material is at a temperature T (when E = 0) and exhibits a high entropy, along with arbitrarily aligned dipoles. This alignment leads to a decrease in the dipolar entropy and an increase in temperature from T to T+\u0394T. The latent heat is extracted from the material, resulting in a decrease in its temperature nearly equivalent to \u0394T. Usually, adiabatic electrocaloric temperature change (\u0394T) and entropy change ( \u0394S) are utilized to assess the efficiency of the electrocaloric effect in polar materials. The ECE of BCZT and BCST ceramics was evaluated using the indirect method, which involves calculations based on thermodynamic Maxwell's equations. The \u0394T and the \u0394S can be determined using the following equations : The symbol \u03c1 represents the density of the sample, whereas Cp represents the specific heat capacity, which is considered to be 400 JkgE^{\u22121}KE^{\u22121}. E 1 and E 2 represent the initial (E = 0) and final (E = 20 kV cmE^{\u22121}) electric fields, respectively. The thermal variation of \u0394T and \u0394S under various applied electric fields for both ceramics is illustrated in (a\u2013d). The results demonstrate that \u0394T and \u0394S rise on increasing the applied electric field. The BCZT ceramic exhibits a maximum temperature change \u0394Tmax \u223c0.72 K and maximum entropy change \u0394Smax \u223c0.77 J kgE^{\u22121}KE^{\u22121}. Similarly, in case of BCST, \u0394Tmax is 0.98 K, and \u0394Smax is 1.15 J kgE^{\u22121}KE^{\u22121} at an electric field of 20.0 kVcmE^{\u22121} near Tc. On comparison of two ceramics, BCST stands out in terms of its electrocaloric qualities since it has a lower density and a higher pyroelectric coefficient. The maximum electrocaloric responsivity (\u03bemax) derived from the ratio of \u0394Tmax /\u0394Emax is 0.36 K mm kVE^{\u22121} for the BCZT compound and 0.49 K mm kVE^{\u22121} for the BCST ceramic. These higher values make the BCST ceramic an excellent candidate for cooling devices. summarizes the electrocaloric properties of our compounds with other BT-based compositions. The obtained \u0394T in this study is comparable at lower applied field; however, \u03bemax value is quite higher for the BCST sample when compared with other BT-based ceramics as shown in. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) is a non-invasive analytical technique used to investigate the absorption properties of ceramics. (a) displays the absorbance spectrum of the BCST compound. The figure clearly shows that the ceramic demonstrates a notable rise in absorption near the absorption edge at a wavelength of 337.48 nm, which is slightly higher than the absorption edge of BCZT (335.6 nm) reported in Ref.. Based on the present study, it is concluded that BCST has a larger bandgap energy. The bandgap value determined from the inset of is around 3.18 eV for BCST, which is greater than that of BCZT (3.0 eV) ceramic. The bandgap value determined from the inset of (a) was around 3.18 eV for BCST, which is greater than that of BCZT (3.0 eV). The distinct difference in the band gap may be attributed to the different electronic structures of the dopants, SnE^{4+}/ZrE^{4+}. SnE^{4+} tends to induce less distortion in the crystal lattice and modifies the electronic states in a way that results in a wider band gap. In contrast, ZrE^{4+}, causes greater lattice distortion and electronic delocalization, leading to a narrower band gap in BCZT. In order to verify the type of the bandgap, (b) displays the relationship between the amount of light reflected and the corresponding wavelength for the BCST compound. Marotti et al. observed that the first derivative of reflectance, dR/d\u03bb, exhibits a peak in the vicinity of E g for a direct bandgap semiconductor. The inset in illustrates that dR/d\u03bb has a peak in the high-energy range around 3.22 eV confirming a direct bandgap for this compound. The contamination of industrial effluent by Methylene Blue (MB) and Rhodamine B (RhB) dyes is a major concern. The results on BCZT piezocatalysis have been published elsewhere , which revealed that BCZT degraded the RhB and MB dye molecules with an efficiency of 74.06 % and 62.69 %, respectively. The experimental results suggest that BCST catalysts achieved degradation efficiency of 62.89 % and 56.07 % for RhB and MB dye molecules, respectively, during a 120-min reaction time as shown in (a\u2013b). Thus, the BCST sample has a lower efficiency to degrade MB and RhB dyes in comparison to BCZT. The rate constants measured for both RhB and MB dyes using BCST ceramic are 78.9 \xd7 10E^{\u22124} minE^{\u22121} and 68.8 \xd7 10E^{\u22124} minE^{\u22121}, respectively, as shown in (c\u2013d). In order to comprehend the primary factors contributing to the lower degrading performance of BCST, it is crucial to have a thorough understanding of the piezocatalysis mechanism. These interactions lead to the creation of oxidized active species, including hydroxyl (\xb7OH) and superoxide (-O2\u2212) radicals. Superoxide ions (-O2\u2212) and hydroxyl radicals (\xb7OH) further react with organic dye molecules in a solution, and degrade them to unharmful products like CO2 and H2O. Therefore, due to smaller piezoelectric coefficient and greater energy bandgap of BCST exhibits lesser piezocatalytic degradation for both dyes when compared with BCZT. Therefore, despite possessing smaller grains, BCST compound exhibits a lower piezoelectric coefficient than BCZT compound and inferior piezocatalytic performance.

High-temperature solid-state reaction method was used for the synthesis of Ba0.92Ca0.08Zr0.09Ti0.91O3 (BCZT) and Ba0.92Ca0.08Sn0.09Ti0.91O3 (BCST) ceramics. To begin with, stoichiometric ratios of high-purity precursors, including BaCO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9 %), CaCO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9 %), ZrO2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9 %), SnO2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9 %), and TiO2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9 %) were mixed. After 2 h of grinding in a mortar and pestle, the combinations were milled for 4 h in an ethanol solution with zirconia balls in a low-energy ball mill. The resulting solutions were dried and the obtained lumps were pulverized and calcined for 4 h at 1200 \xb0C in air ambient. The resulting granulated powders of BCZT and BCST ceramics were reground and molded into disk-shaped pellets (1 mm thick and 10 mm in diameter) with the addition of 1 wt % polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as an organic binder. To burn off the PVA binder, the pellets were first heated for 1 h at 650 \xb0C at a rate of 1 \xb0C per minute. Subsequently, the binder-free pellets of both compounds underwent simultaneous sintering for 4 h at 1400 \xb0C in air. The phase purity of the sintered pellets was examined in a 2\u03b8 range from 20\xb0 to 80\xb0 using the PANalytical Empyrean X-ray diffractometer (XRD) equipped with Cu K \u03b1 (\u03bb = 1.5405 \xc5) radiation. The XRD patterns thus obtained were Rietveld refined using the FULLPROF software. The crystal structures were visualized using the VESTA software. The surface morphology and elemental composition of the sintered samples were analyzed using a high-resolution Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM,7610F Plus/JEOL) attached with Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The dielectric constant and tangent loss at various frequencies (100Hz - 10 kHz) and temperatures, ranging from 30 \xb0C to 150 \xb0C were measured using a programmable furnace equipped with an Alpha-A high-performance modular measurement system from Novocontrol Technologies, Germany. The piezoelectric measurements were performed at room temperature utilizing an Autocal 230 \xb0C Piezoelectric Test Chamber coupled with a Radiant Multiferroic tester. The absorbance measurements covering a wavelength range of 200 nm\u2013800 nm were carried out at room temperature using a Cary 5000 UV\u2013vis\u2013NIR spectrophotometer.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a) shows the room temperature X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of BCZT and BCST ceramics. These patterns reveal distinctive peaks that indicate a perovskite structure, devoid of any impurities, confirming the successful incorporation of CaE^{2+}, ZrE^{4+}, and SnE^{4+} ions into the BaTiO3 lattice. The characteristic peaks correspond to the established BaTiO3 diffraction patterns outlined in the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) files #79\u20132264 and #81\u20132200, representing the tetragonal (T) and orthorhombic (O) phases of the BaTiO3 ceramic, respectively, The Gaussian fitting of the peaks at 2\u03b8 \u2248 45\xb0, as illustrated in (b), also corroborate the coexistence of tetragonal (T) and orthorhombic (O) phases in the studied ceramics. The result of Rietveld refinement performed against the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of BCZT and BCST ceramics is depicted in (c\u2013d), respectively. From the refinement, it can be deduced that there exists a coexistence of tetragonal (T, P4mm) and orthorhombic (O, Amm2) phases. The BCZT ceramic comprises 55.18 wt% tetragonal phase and 44.82 wt% orthorhombic phase, while the BCST ceramic contains 48.10 wt% tetragonal phase and 51.90 wt% orthorhombic phase. The discrepancy in the phase distribution between BCZT and BCST may likely be attributed to the difference in ionic radii between ZrE^{4+} (0.72 \xc5) and SnE^{4+} (0.69 \xc5) ions. ZrE^{4+}, having a larger ionic radius in comparison to that of TiE^{4+} (0.605 \xc5), causes a greater elongation along the c-axis, leading to an enhanced lattice distortion. This increased distortion stabilizes the tetragonal symmetry, which is further supported by a higher c/a ratio observed in BCZT compound. Consequently, BCZT exhibits a higher proportion of the tetragonal phase. In contrast, SnE^{4+} ion, though slightly larger than TiE^{4+} ion, is smaller than ZrE^{4+} ion, results in lesser lattice distortion. This distortion favors the stabilization of the orthorhombic phase, explaining the higher orthorhombic phase percentage in BCST compound. The lattice parameters (a, b, c) obtained from the XRD refinement are presented in , which also encompasses the lattice volume (V) and goodness of fit (\u03c7 E^{2}) values for both compounds. The changes in unit cell volume from the parent lattice confirm the successful incorporation of CaE^{2+}, ZrE^{4+}, SnE^{4+} into BaTiO3 lattice. The increase in the unit cell volume of BCZT (64.74 \xc5\xb3 in tetragonal phase and 129.24 \xc5\xb3 in orthorhombic phase) compared to that of the parent BaTiO3 lattice (64.28 \xc5\xb3 in tetragonal phase and 128.76 \xc5\xb3 in orthorhombic phase) can be attributed to a larger ionic radius of ZrE^{4+} (0.72 \xc5) ion compared to that of TiE^{4+}(0.605 \xc5) ion. Conversely, in case of BCST, the unit cell volume (64.18 \xc5\xb3 in the tetragonal phase and 126.27 \xc5\xb3 in the orthorhombic phase) decreases in comparison to that of BaTiO3 despite the doping of SnE^{4+} (0.69 \xc5), which has a larger radius than TiE^{4+} ion. This discrepancy may be attributed to a significantly higher effective electron affinity of Sn (107.3 kJ/mol) when compared with that of Ti (7.6 kJ/mol). Further, it is also clear from that the BCZT ceramic exhibits a higher tetragonality ratio (c/a) in comparison to that of BCST ceramic. The bulk density of the ceramics was determined using the Archimedes' principle, providing values of 5.91 g cmE^{\u22123} and 5.80 g cmE^{\u22123} for BCZT and BCST ceramics, respectively. In terms of relative density, the BCZT ceramic has a density of 98.17 %, and the BCST ceramic has a density of 96.34 %. A higher density of BCZT indicates better dielectric and piezoelectric properties. presents the atomic coordinates for both BCZT and BCST ceramics. From there, it can be inferred that CaE^{2+} ions are substituted at BaE^{2+} site, while ZrE^{4+} and SnE^{4+} ions occupy the TiE^{4+} site in BCZT and BCST ceramics as confirmed from the similar Wyckoff positions. The VESTA software generated crystal structures of the BCZT and BCST compounds, as shown in the insets of (c\u2013d), using the parameters from and 2 The Fourier subprogram in FULLPROF was used to calculate the scattering density inside the unit cell of the ceramics. The application of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) as a subroutine was used to speed up the calculation of the given expression. where, V represents the volume of the unit cell, H is the reciprocal lattice vector, r denotes the vector position within the unit cell, and F(H) corresponds to the complex Fourier coefficients employed for various Fourier transform operations. The unit of \u03c1(r) is determined by dividing the unit of F(H) by the unit of V. The electron density within the unit cell was determined and the same is illustrated in (a\u2013b) which suggests that the BCZT ceramic exhibits a higher electron density compared to that of BCST ceramic. ZrE^{4+} has a different electron distribution compared to SnE^{4+}. ZrE^{4+}, with its [Kr] 4 dE^{2} electronic configuration, tends to contribute more to the electron density in the crystal structure. On the other hand, SnE^{4+} ion, with a [Kr] 5sE^{2} 4 dE^{1}\u2070 configuration, does not influence the electron density as strongly. The higher electron density in BCZT can thus be attributed to the nature of the ZrE^{4+} ion's electron cloud and its interaction with surrounding atoms. At room temperature, both BCZT and BCST compounds exhibit dual-phase crystal structures. The FESEM images of sintered BCZT and BCST ceramics are shown in (a\u2013b). The BCZT ceramic shows the existence of more number of larger grains than those in the BCST compound. The disparity in grain size between the two compounds is also corroborated by the histograms shown in (c\u2013d) for the BCZT and BCST compounds, respectively. The histograms show a grain size distribution curve, indicating that a greater number of grains fall within the range of 3\u20134 \u03bcm for BCZT ceramic and 1\u20132 \u03bcm for BCST ceramic. (e\u2013f) displays the elemental composition of the ceramics as determined from the EDX analysis. The theoretical and experimental atomic percentages (at. %) of the constituent elements in the ceramics are presented in the insets of (e\u2013f). In BCZT ceramics, the experimental atomic ratios of Ba/Ca and Ti/Zr are found to be 11.66 and 10.98, respectively. For comparison, the Ba/Ca and Ti/Sn ratios in BCST ceramics are 11.94 and 9.54, respectively. Theoretical atomic ratios Ba/Ca and Ti/Zr or Ti/Sn are 11.5 and 10.11, respectively, revealing a fair match. Additional peaks appear in both EDX spectra at about 2.1 and 9.1 keV, indicating the presence of gold used to coat the samples for measurement. (a\u2013d) illustrates the temperature dependent dielectric constant (\u025b) and loss tangent (tan\u03b4) of BCZT and BCST compounds at different frequencies (0.1, 1, 5, and 10 KHz). (a) demonstrates that the BCZT compound undergoes two distinct phase transitions; the first from orthorhombic to tetragonal at temperature (T O-T) \u223c 52 \xb0C, and the second from tetragonal to cubic at the Curie temperature (T C) \u223c 105 \xb0C. In contrast, in (b), the BCST compound exhibits a single-phase transition from tetragonal to cubic phase at T C \u223c 70 \xb0C, a significantly lower temperature compared to that of BCZT ceramic. It is a well-established fact that substitution of SnE^{4+} ion at TiE^{4+} site in BT-based ceramics reduces the T C at much faster rate when compared to the substitution of ZrE^{4+} ion at TiE^{4+} site. Literature also confirms that substituting SnE^{4+} ion at TiE^{4+} site in BT-based ceramics reduces the phase transition temperatures. This can be understood as SnE^{4+} has a more isotropic electron cloud due to its electronic configuration ([Kr] 5sE^{2} 4 dE^{1}), which reduces the overall polarization of the material. Since T C is linked to the strength of the dipole-dipole interactions within the material, lower polarization caused by SnE^{4}\u207asubstitution weakens these interactions and decreases T C more significantly. Since the Rietveld refinement indicates presence of two phases in BCST ceramic, we confirmed this by taking the derivative of the dielectric constant at 0.1 kHz. The inset of depicts the derivate of the dielectric constant-versus temperature graph of BCST compound from where a noticeable hump near room temperature can be noticed. This attests a phase transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic phase in BCST compound near room temperature. Dielectric loss tangent (tan\u03b4) refers to the dissipation of energy that occurs when the polarization lags behind the applied electric field. The variation of tan\u03b4 with temperature at different frequencies is shown in (c\u2013d) for the studied compounds. The tan\u03b4 values for the compounds are maximum near the high-temperature dielectric peaks. The peak dielectric maximum (\u03b5m) and tan\u03b4 near the Curie temperature are \u223c13304 and \u223c0.06 for BCZT, and \u223c12112 and \u223c0.15 for BCST compound at 1 KHz applied frequency. Above 125 \xb0C, the dispersion in tan\u03b4 may be attributed to the predominance of the grain boundaries' influence in comparison to the grains. The formation of polar nano-regions (PNRs) may be responsible for the transition of the material from a normal ferroelectric to a relaxor ferroelectric. For this, Uchino and Nomura proposed a modified version of the Curie-Weiss law. where, T represents the temperature, C denotes the Curie\u2013Weiss constant, and the relaxation degree represented by \u03b3 (1 < \u03b3 < 2) characterizes the ferroelectric nature. The value of \u03b3 is 1 for regular ferroelectrics and 2 for optimal relaxor ferroelectrics. (a\u2013b) displays the relationship between the log ( 1\u025b\u2212 1 \u025bm) against log ( T\u2212 Tm) at a frequency of 1 kHz. The \u03b3 values observed for BCZT and BCST ceramics are 1.59 and 1.62, respectively. Although these values indicate that neither BCZT nor BCST ceramic exhibit strong relaxor behavior, their \u03b3 values being above 1 suggest the presence of slight relaxor characteristics. The hysteresis loops measurements depicting the percentage strain versus electric field and conducted up to a maximum field intensity of 20 kV cmE^{\u22121} and applied frequency of 10 Hz for the BCZT and BCST compounds are shown in (a\u2013b). The determined d33\u2217 values are \u223c609 p.m. VE^{\u22121} for BCZT and \u223c358 p.m. VE^{\u22121} for BCST ceramic. Despite exhibiting greater relaxor behavior, the BCST compound possesses a lower d33\u2217 value when compared with that of BCZT ceramic. This difference is due to a lower tetragonality ratio (1.0034) and bulk density (5.80 g cmE^{\u2212}\xb3) for the former than the tetragonality ratio (1.0051) and bulk density (5.91 g cmE^{\u2212}\xb3) for the latter compound. The superior d33\u2217 value of BCZT ceramic may also be attributed to its higher percentage of the tetragonal phase. Among the various phases present in BT-based ceramics, the tetragonal phase provides the highest piezoelectricity due to its highly asymmetric nature. Furthermore, the smaller grain size in BCST ceramic could lead to domain wall pinning by grain boundaries, resulting in reduced piezoelectricity in this compound. The pyroelectric coefficient (p= \u0394 Ps \u0394T) for the studied compounds was determined from the slope of a graph between the spontaneous polarization (Ps) and temperature (T). The graphs are shown in (a\u2013b). The pyroelectric coefficient exhibits its peak values at specific temperature intervals: 342\u2013368 K for BCZT compound, reaching \u22121861.9 \u03bcCmE^{-2} KE^{\u22121}, and 322\u2013343 K for BCST ceramic with a value of \u22122482.2 \u03bcCmE^{-2} KE^{\u22121}. Further, at lower temperatures (312\u2013337 K for BCZT and 347\u2013368 K for BCST), the pyroelectric coefficient remains substantial (\u22121396.9 \u03bcCmE^{-2} KE^{\u22121} for BCZT and \u22121794.0 \u03bcCmE^{-2} KE^{\u22121} for BCST), indicating the persistence of the ferroelectric behaviour. However, at higher temperatures (372\u2013393 K for BCZT and 347\u2013368 K for BCST), the pyroelectric coefficient sharply falls (\u221265.6 \u03bcCmE^{-2} KE^{\u22121} for BCZT and \u221267.8 \u03bcCmE^{-2} KE^{\u22121} for BCST). Furthermore, the comparison between BCZT and BCST reveals that BCZT exhibits a lower pyroelectric coefficient. This is because BCZT contains more acceptor ion dopants, particularly ZrE^{4+}. The enhanced pyroelectric coefficient observed in BCST suggests its potential for a higher electrocaloric effect, indicating its suitability for applications requiring efficient temperature-induced polarization changes. The enhanced pyroelectric coefficient observed in BCST suggests a higher electrocaloric effect in this compound. Each ferroelectric material possesses a distinct hysteresis loop (P-E loop) between electric polarization and applied electric field from which one can determine key parameters such as spontaneous polarization (Ps), remnant polarization (Pr), and coercive field (Ec). compares the room-temperature hysteresis loops of the BCZT and BCST compounds. From there, one may observe that the P-E loop for BCST is narrower than that of BCZT due to the presence of polar nanoregions and the ensuing relaxor behaviour in the former compound. The values of Pr (11.92 \u03bcC cmE^{\u22122}) and Ec (1.11 kV cmE^{\u22121}) in the BCST sample are lower than that of the BCZT compound (15.76 \u03bcC cmE^{\u22122} & 1.45 kV cmE^{\u22121}). However, the Pmax value (46.85 \u03bcC cmE^{\u22122}) in the BCST is larger than the Pmax value of BCZT (37.06 \u03bcC cmE^{\u22122}). Further, (b\u2013c) illustrates P-E loops at different temperatures for both BCZT and BCST ceramics. It can be noticed that as the temperature rises, the P\u2013E loops become narrower, and there is a gradual decrease in Pr, Ec, and Pmax values for both materials, which is a well-known fact. At temperatures above Tc (\u223c105 \xb0C for BCZT and \u223c70 \xb0C for BCST), the P-E loops exhibit a behaviour reminiscent of a paraelectric phase. The total energy density (W tot) and recoverable energy density (W rec), as well as the efficiency (\u03b7), of the studied compounds were determined by analyzing the P-E hysteresis loops using the following equations : It is important to remember that achieving high energy storage densities and efficiency in relaxor ferroelectric based-ceramics relies on optimizing the electrical breakdown strength, polarization, dielectric constant, and dielectric loss. (e\u2013f) illustrates the changes in the energy storage capacity of BCZT and BCST ceramics when subjected to thermal variation at an electric field strength of 20 kV cmE^{\u22121}. At 35 \xb0C, the values of W tot, W rec, and \u03b7 are 201, 127 mJcmE^{\u22123}, and 63.18 % for BCZT; and 261, 191.8 mJcmE^{\u22123}, and 73.26 % for BCST. The increased energy storage capability of the BCST compound can be attributed to a higher charge storage density (Q c = Pmax - P r ) owing to its smaller grain size and an enhanced relaxor behaviour. Near Tc, the values of W tot, W rec, and \u03b7 are 164.4 mJ cmE^{\u22123}, 152.0 mJ cmE^{\u22123}, and 92.41 % for BCZT; and 189.68 mJ cmE^{\u22123}, 164.27 mJ cmE^{\u22123}, and 88.68 % for BCST compound. The breakdown electric field (E b ) for BCZT and BCST ceramics can be estimated with the following Weibull distribution function. where, i, n, and Ei represent the serial number of each ceramic, the total number of compounds, and the breakdown electric field of the ceramic in ascending order, respectively. As shown in (a), the linear relationship between xi and yi for all samples demonstrates m value greater than 10, confirming the reliability of the breakdown electric field (Eb) for both ceramics. The P d is calculated using the equation  where f represents the frequency of the AC signal. The calculated Pd values for BCZT and BCST ceramics near room temperature (35 \xb0C) and at their respective Curie temperatures (T C ) are shown in (b). The electrocaloric effect (ECE) articulates the change in isothermal entropy or adiabatic temperature of a dielectric substance when an electric field is applied or removed. depicts a schematic representation of the ECE cooling cycle, which consists of four distinct phases (A-D). During the first stage of the cooling cycle, the polar material is at a temperature T (when E = 0) and exhibits a high entropy, along with arbitrarily aligned dipoles. This alignment leads to a decrease in the dipolar entropy and an increase in temperature from T to T+\u0394T. The latent heat is extracted from the material, resulting in a decrease in its temperature nearly equivalent to \u0394T. Usually, adiabatic electrocaloric temperature change (\u0394T) and entropy change ( \u0394S) are utilized to assess the efficiency of the electrocaloric effect in polar materials. The ECE of BCZT and BCST ceramics was evaluated using the indirect method, which involves calculations based on thermodynamic Maxwell's equations. The \u0394T and the \u0394S can be determined using the following equations : The symbol \u03c1 represents the density of the sample, whereas Cp represents the specific heat capacity, which is considered to be 400 JkgE^{\u22121}KE^{\u22121}. E 1 and E 2 represent the initial (E = 0) and final (E = 20 kV cmE^{\u22121}) electric fields, respectively. The thermal variation of \u0394T and \u0394S under various applied electric fields for both ceramics is illustrated in (a\u2013d). The results demonstrate that \u0394T and \u0394S rise on increasing the applied electric field. The BCZT ceramic exhibits a maximum temperature change \u0394Tmax \u223c0.72 K and maximum entropy change \u0394Smax \u223c0.77 J kgE^{\u22121}KE^{\u22121}. Similarly, in case of BCST, \u0394Tmax is 0.98 K, and \u0394Smax is 1.15 J kgE^{\u22121}KE^{\u22121} at an electric field of 20.0 kVcmE^{\u22121} near Tc. On comparison of two ceramics, BCST stands out in terms of its electrocaloric qualities since it has a lower density and a higher pyroelectric coefficient. The maximum electrocaloric responsivity (\u03bemax) derived from the ratio of \u0394Tmax /\u0394Emax is 0.36 K mm kVE^{\u22121} for the BCZT compound and 0.49 K mm kVE^{\u22121} for the BCST ceramic. These higher values make the BCST ceramic an excellent candidate for cooling devices. summarizes the electrocaloric properties of our compounds with other BT-based compositions. The obtained \u0394T in this study is comparable at lower applied field; however, \u03bemax value is quite higher for the BCST sample when compared with other BT-based ceramics as shown in. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) is a non-invasive analytical technique used to investigate the absorption properties of ceramics. (a) displays the absorbance spectrum of the BCST compound. The figure clearly shows that the ceramic demonstrates a notable rise in absorption near the absorption edge at a wavelength of 337.48 nm, which is slightly higher than the absorption edge of BCZT (335.6 nm) reported in Ref.. Based on the present study, it is concluded that BCST has a larger bandgap energy. The bandgap value determined from the inset of is around 3.18 eV for BCST, which is greater than that of BCZT (3.0 eV) ceramic. The bandgap value determined from the inset of (a) was around 3.18 eV for BCST, which is greater than that of BCZT (3.0 eV). The distinct difference in the band gap may be attributed to the different electronic structures of the dopants, SnE^{4+}/ZrE^{4+}. SnE^{4+} tends to induce less distortion in the crystal lattice and modifies the electronic states in a way that results in a wider band gap. In contrast, ZrE^{4+}, causes greater lattice distortion and electronic delocalization, leading to a narrower band gap in BCZT. In order to verify the type of the bandgap, (b) displays the relationship between the amount of light reflected and the corresponding wavelength for the BCST compound. Marotti et al. observed that the first derivative of reflectance, dR/d\u03bb, exhibits a peak in the vicinity of E g for a direct bandgap semiconductor. The inset in illustrates that dR/d\u03bb has a peak in the high-energy range around 3.22 eV confirming a direct bandgap for this compound. The contamination of industrial effluent by Methylene Blue (MB) and Rhodamine B (RhB) dyes is a major concern. The results on BCZT piezocatalysis have been published elsewhere , which revealed that BCZT degraded the RhB and MB dye molecules with an efficiency of 74.06 % and 62.69 %, respectively. The experimental results suggest that BCST catalysts achieved degradation efficiency of 62.89 % and 56.07 % for RhB and MB dye molecules, respectively, during a 120-min reaction time as shown in (a\u2013b). Thus, the BCST sample has a lower efficiency to degrade MB and RhB dyes in comparison to BCZT. The rate constants measured for both RhB and MB dyes using BCST ceramic are 78.9 \xd7 10E^{\u22124} minE^{\u22121} and 68.8 \xd7 10E^{\u22124} minE^{\u22121}, respectively, as shown in (c\u2013d). In order to comprehend the primary factors contributing to the lower degrading performance of BCST, it is crucial to have a thorough understanding of the piezocatalysis mechanism. These interactions lead to the creation of oxidized active species, including hydroxyl (\xb7OH) and superoxide (-O2\u2212) radicals. Superoxide ions (-O2\u2212) and hydroxyl radicals (\xb7OH) further react with organic dye molecules in a solution, and degrade them to unharmful products like CO2 and H2O. Therefore, due to smaller piezoelectric coefficient and greater energy bandgap of BCST exhibits lesser piezocatalytic degradation for both dyes when compared with BCZT. Therefore, despite possessing smaller grains, BCST compound exhibits a lower piezoelectric coefficient than BCZT compound and inferior piezocatalytic performance.
