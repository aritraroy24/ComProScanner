Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'solid-phase reaction', 'precursors': ['BaCO3', 'CaCO3', 'TiO2', 'ZrO2'], 'steps': ['Accurately weigh raw materials according to the stoichiometric ratio.', 'Mix the weighed powders with moderate ethanol and ball-mill for 12 hours.', 'Dry the mixture at 120°C.', 'Calcine the dried powder at 1250°C for 5 hours.', 'Ball-mill the calcined powder again for 12 hours.', 'Press the ball-milled powder into desired shapes using a cold isostatic press at 30 MPa for 15 minutes.', 'Sinter the pressed samples at temperatures between 1400°C and 1500°C for 4 hours to obtain dense ceramic plates.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'SEM', 'Raman Spectroscopy']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
