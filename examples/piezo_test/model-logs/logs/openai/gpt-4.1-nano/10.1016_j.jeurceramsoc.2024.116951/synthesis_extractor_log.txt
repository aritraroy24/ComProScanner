PMN-PZT thin films were grown by RF magnetron sputtering from ceramic target. Before the growth of PMN-PZT thin films, the conductive buffer layer LNO was first deposited on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrate at 430 \xb0C and the ratio of sputtering gases Ar and O2 was 8:1. The sputtering power and pressure were 90 W and 0.5 Pa, respectively. During the sputtering process of PMN-PZT, the substrate temperature was maintained at 550 \xb0C, with a ratio of Ar to O2 of 20:1, and the sputtering power and pressure were 150 W and 0.5 Pa. By adjusting the sputtering time, PMN-PZT thin films of different thicknesses were prepared. To promote the nucleation and crystallization, the films were subjected to an annealing treatment in a rapid thermal processing furnace with a heating rate of 30 \xb0C/s between 600 \xb0C and 700 \xb0C for a duration of 20 mins to 40 mins in an air atmosphere. For further electrical measurement, Au top electrodes were deposited on the top surface of the PMN-PZT thin films using DC sputtering through a shadow mask with a radius of 0.15 mm. The phase structure of LNO buffer layer and PMN-PZT thin films were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) instrument (Bruker D8 focus, Bruker AXS, Karlsruhe, Germany). The cross-sectional and grain morphology of the PMN-PZT films were characterized via a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, S-4800, Hitachi, Japan). The dielectric constant (\u03b5 33 T/ \u03b5 0) and dissipation factor (tan\u03b4) were measured by an impedance analyzer (Agilent HP4294A, Santa Clara, CA). The P-E loops of thin films were observed by a ferroelectric analyzer at 1 kHz (TF2000, aixACCT, Aachen, Germany). In the dual AC resonance tracking (DART) mode, the PFM phase, amplitude signal, domain structure, and domain switching of the films were measured by piezoresponse force microscope (PFM, MFP-3D, Asylum Research, America) at a scanning frequency of 1 Hz. The quasi-static piezoelectric coefficient d 33 of PMN-PZT thin films was measured by a normal load method and details can be found in our previous work. The direction of the applied force was applied perpendicular to the film surface, and the quasi-static piezoelectric coefficient d 33 was calculated from the following piezoelectric equation: during the d 33 test, the sample electrode area was 3.14 mmE^{2} and the test frequency was 6 Hz.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The annealing temperature dependence of the structure and electrical properties for the 600 nm-thick PMN-PZT thin films were first studied. shows the XRD \u03b8-2\u03b8 patterns of the LNO-buffered substrate, as-grown PMN-PZT thin film and the films annealed at 600 \xb0C, 650 \xb0C, 700 \xb0C for 30 mins, respectively. It can be found that the unannealed PMN-PZT films displayed pyrochlore phase. After annealing, the films exhibited characteristic peaks near 22\xb0 and 45\xb0, which corresponded to the <100> and <200> orientations of the perovskite phase, indicating that PMN-PZT possessed a pure phase structure and <100>-oriented growth. This indicated that the <100>-texture of LNO buffer layer promoted the <100>-oriented growth of PMN-PZT due to the good lattice matching, which can promote the transformation of the pyrochlore phase into perovskite. From , the characteristic peaks of the PMN-PZT thin films obtained at 600 \xb0C and 650 \xb0C were sharp and narrow, suggesting that the rapid annealing process significantly enhanced the crystallinity, and the orientation degree along <100> direction was notably high. When the annealing temperature further increased to 700 \xb0C, the relative characteristic peak intensity of the film weakened, which might be attributed to the volatilization of lead element at higher annealing temperature. Also it can be seen that the <200> diffraction peak of LNO moves rightwards from 46\xb0 to 48\xb0 with the increase of annealing temperature, and this process was related to the increased in-plane lattice expansion of the LNO annealed at higher temperature. According to the Poisson\u2019s ratio, the out-of-plane crystal lattice decreased and the characteristic peak shifted to higher angle position. shows the surface topography of 600 nm-thick unannealed PMN-PZT thin films and films annealing at 600 \xb0C, 650 \xb0C, 700 \xb0C, respectively. Compared to the annealed thin films, the as-deposited films exhibited smaller grain sizes (about 137.4 nm). It is evident that an escalation in the annealing temperature accompanied with the formation of the perovskite phase and a progressive increase of the grain size (203 nm at annealing temperature of 600 \xb0C and 277 nm at annealing temperature of 650 \xb0C). Upon reaching an annealing temperature of 700 \xb0C, the pores appeared. This indicated that at elevated temperatures, the substantial evaporation of lead element led to lead vacancy defects, which in turn, had a detrimental impact on the crystallinity along with the microscale morphology of the thin films. shows the frequency dependence of the dielectric constant (\u03b5 33 T/ \u03b5 0) and dissipation factor (tan\u03b4) of the 600 nm-thick PMN-PZT thin films at distinct annealing temperatures. The typical values of \u03b5 33 T/ \u03b5 0 (tan\u03b4) at 1 kHz for films annealed at 600 \xb0C, 650 \xb0C, and 700 \xb0C were measured to be 1106 (0.032), 1319 (0.034), and 1582 (0.06), respectively. An increase in the annealing temperature resulted in a gradual rise in the dielectric constant of the PMN-PZT thin films, suggesting that elevated annealing conditions were conducive to the enhancement of grain growth and the improvement of crystalline quality. Nevertheless, upon further elevation of the annealing temperature to 700 \xb0C, the tan\u03b4 increased. The polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loops of the 600 nm-thick PMN-PZT thin films annealed between 600 and 700 \xb0C are depicted in. At 1 kHz, the remnant polarization (P r) and the coercive electric field (E C) of the films were measured to be 29 \u03bcC/ cmE^{2} (7.5 kV/mm), 40 \u03bcC/ cmE^{2} (7.5 kV/mm), and 41 \u03bcC/ cmE^{2} (7.2 kV/mm) under the electric field of 80 kV/mm, 80 kV/mm, and 30 kV/mm, respectively. Examination of the revealed that the films annealed at temperatures of 600 \xb0C and 650 \xb0C exhibited the characteristic rectangular hysteresis loops, indicative of a ferroelectric behavior. However, the thin film subjected to annealing at a temperature of 700 \xb0C demonstrated a reduced breakdown field and couldn\u2019t endure the 80 kV/mm electric field. During our experiments, the annealing time dependence of the structure and electrical properties for the PMN-PZT thin films were also performed at fixed annealing temperature of 650 \xb0C. shows the XRD \u03b8-2\u03b8 patterns of the 600 nm-thick PMN-PZT thin films annealed at 650 \xb0C for 20 mins, 30 mins and 40 mins. It can be observed that the PMN-PZT thin films subjected to annealing for 30 mins exhibited relatively higher diffraction intensity for the <100> and <200> peaks compared to those annealed for other durations. The thin film annealed for 20 mins exhibited irregular large grain protrusions, which may be attributed to the insufficient annealing time that limited the energy migration and diffusion of the grains. Under the 30 mins and 40 mins annealing duration, larger grain size could be observed and there were more pores in the sample annealed for 40 mins compared to that annealed for 30 mins. These observations were also consistent with the cross-sectional views presented in (d)-(f). displays the dielectric spectrum of the PMN-PZT thin films annealing at 650 \xb0C for different durations. The typical values of \u03b5 33 T/ \u03b5 0 (tan\u03b4) at 1 kHz for films annealed for 20 mins, 30 mins, and 40 mins were measured to be 939 (0.030), 1259 (0.034), and 1319 (0.036), respectively. It is observable that the dielectric constant of the films increased significantly with the increase of annealing time, while the dielectric loss increased slightly. illustrates the P-E hysteresis loops of the 600 nm-thick PMN-PZT thin films fabricated under various annealing durations at room temperature. It is observed that the PMN-PZT thin films annealed for 20 mins, 30 mins, and 40 mins all exhibited typical rectangular hysteresis loops. At 1 kHz, the remnant polarization (P r) and the coercive electric field (E C) of the films were measured to be 22 \u03bcC/ cmE^{2} (6.0 kV/mm), 41 \u03bcC/ cmE^{2} (7.2 kV/mm), and 40 \u03bcC/ cmE^{2} (7.5 kV/mm), respectively. At an annealing time of 30 mins, the film saturated under a bias field of 90 kV/mm and had a high breakdown resistance. However, when the annealing time was increased to 40 mins, the breakdown field strength of the films decreased substantially. The results indicated that the PMN-PZT thin films annealed at 650 \xb0C for 30 mins possessed relatively superior global electrical properties. Considering that films with thickness of micrometer-thick were required for piezoelectric MEMS applications, in this work, the thickness-dependent electrical properties of PMN-PZT films were investigated. (a) shows the XRD \u03b8-2\u03b8 patterns of PMN-PZT with 200 nm, 600 nm, and 1500 nm, respectively. With the increase of film thickness, the relative intensity of <100> and <200> diffraction peaks for PMN-PZT films gradually increased and the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) decreased, demonstrating better crystallization quality. In addition, the <100> and <200> diffraction peaks shifted leftwards with the thickness increasing, indicating the expansion of the out-of-plane c-axis lattice. Because of the difference of the thermal expansion coefficients between the Si and the PMN-PZT, the PMN-PZT thin film on silicon is typically under a tensile strain. Therefore, the interplanar spacing will increase and the characteristic diffraction peaks shifted leftward based on the Bragg equation. shows the cross-sectional morphologies of PMN-PZT thin films. From the images, it can be observed that the interfaces of PMN-PZT thin films were clear, and the films owned dense morphologies. In (a), it can be seen that the 200 nm thick films owned smaller grains with more porosity. (b) and (c) indicated that as the thickness of the film increased, accompanied by an increase in the sputtering time at 550 \xb0C, the thermal budget also increased and the porosity within the films decreased. When the film thickness reached 1500 nm, the structure of the upper layer of the film resembled the morphology of an epitaxial-grown film on a single-crystal substrate. This was also related with the reduction of substrate clamping with increased thickness, allowing the grains to grow more uniformly. shows the dielectric constant \u03b5 33 T/ \u03b5 0 and loss (tan\u03b4) of the PMN-PZT thin films under different thickness with the frequency range from 0.1 to 100 kHz. At 1 kHz, the dielectric constant and loss of PMN-PZT thin films were 846 (0.036), 1319 (0.034), and 1398 (0.036), under the thickness of 200 nm, 600 nm, and 1200 nm. The results indicated that the ratio of \u03b5 33 T/ \u03b5 0 showed a gradually increasing trend. The polarization-electric field (P-E) loops of PMN-PZT thin films under 200 nm, 600 nm, and 1500 nm are shown in. The P r and E C of PMN-PZT films for the three thickness under 1 kHz were 16 \u03bcC/ cmE^{2} (7 kV/mm), 40 \u03bcC/ cmE^{2} (7.5 kV/mm), 49 \u03bcC/ cmE^{2} (5.7 kV/mm), respectively. As the thickness increased, the remnant polarization of the PMN-PZT thin films tended to strengthen. The substrate clamping releasing made the switching of ferroelectric domains easier, accompanied with enhanced macroscopic ferroelectric properties. (a)-(j) presents the surface morphology, out-of-plane PFM amplitude and phase images of 600 nm-thick and 1500 nm-thick PMN-PZT thin films in 3\xd73 \u03bcmE^{2} area. The out-of-plane phase images demonstrated that the 600 nm-thick PMN-PZT thin film exhibited irregular domain patterns and nano-size domain could be detected. With the thickness increased to 1500 nm, ferroelectric domain size increased. To observe the evolution of domain switching in PMN-PZT thin films, in-situ negative voltages were written in the central area of 1 \xd7 1 \u03bcmE^{2}, and the same positive voltage was written in the external area of 2 \xd7 2 \u03bcmE^{2}. From the out-of-plane phase images, it can be seen that when the DC poling voltage exceeded the coercive voltage, clear polarization inversion can be observed. Under a direct voltage of \xb112 V, the phase images of 1500 nm-thick film exhibited a pronounced contrast between the central and outer square regions, indicative of complete ferroelectric domain switching. While for the 600 nm-thick PMN-PZT thin films, a relatively higher voltage of 16 V is required. To measure the piezoelectric coefficient of micrometer-thick PMN-PZT, an Au electrodes was sputtered onto the surface of the 1.5 \u03bcm thick PMN-PZT thin film. The polarization conditions were set at 10 kV/mm with a temperature of 140 \xb0C and a polarization duration of 5 mins. Upward and downward DC electric fields were applied to the PMN-PZT thin films, respectively. After that, the piezoelectric coefficients of the PMN-PZT thin films were compared shown in (b). It can be observed that for the non-polarized film, weak piezoelectric response with effective d 33 of 85 pC/N was detected, indicating slightly self-polarization characteristics in the as-prepared film. Here the highest piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) poled upward can reached up to 484 pC/N, which showed a two-fold enhancement relative to the commercial Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 and previously-reported Mn-doped 0.36Pb(In1/2Nb1/2)O3-0.36Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3 thin films measured using the same method. The excellent piezoelectric performance and high quality make the PMN-PZT film great potential in application to advanced piezoelectric MEMS devices.

Upward and downward DC electric fields were applied to the PMN-PZT thin films, respectively. After that, the piezoelectric coefficients of the PMN-PZT thin films were compared shown in (b). It can be observed that for the non-polarized film, weak piezoelectric response with effective d 33 of 85 pC/N was detected, indicating slightly self-polarization characteristics in the as-prepared film. Here the highest piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) poled upward can reached up to 484 pC/N, which showed a two-fold enhancement relative to the commercial Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 and previously-reported Mn-doped 0.36Pb(In1/2Nb1/2)O3-0.36Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3 thin films measured using the same method. The excellent piezoelectric performance and high quality make the PMN-PZT film great potential in application to advanced piezoelectric MEMS devices.

PMN-PZT thin films were grown by RF magnetron sputtering from ceramic target. Before the growth of PMN-PZT thin films, the conductive buffer layer LNO was first deposited on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrate at 430 \xb0C and the ratio of sputtering gases Ar and O2 was 8:1. The sputtering power and pressure were 90 W and 0.5 Pa, respectively. During the sputtering process of PMN-PZT, the substrate temperature was maintained at 550 \xb0C, with a ratio of Ar to O2 of 20:1, and the sputtering power and pressure were 150 W and 0.5 Pa. By adjusting the sputtering time, PMN-PZT thin films of different thicknesses were prepared. To promote the nucleation and crystallization, the films were subjected to an annealing treatment in a rapid thermal processing furnace with a heating rate of 30 \xb0C/s between 600 \xb0C and 700 \xb0C for a duration of 20 mins to 40 mins in an air atmosphere. For further electrical measurement, Au top electrodes were deposited on the top surface of the PMN-PZT thin films using DC sputtering through a shadow mask with a radius of 0.15 mm. The phase structure of LNO buffer layer and PMN-PZT thin films were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) instrument (Bruker D8 focus, Bruker AXS, Karlsruhe, Germany). The cross-sectional and grain morphology of the PMN-PZT films were characterized via a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, S-4800, Hitachi, Japan). The dielectric constant (\u03b5 33 T/ \u03b5 0) and dissipation factor (tan\u03b4) were measured by an impedance analyzer (Agilent HP4294A, Santa Clara, CA). The P-E loops of thin films were observed by a ferroelectric analyzer at 1 kHz (TF2000, aixACCT, Aachen, Germany). In the dual AC resonance tracking (DART) mode, the PFM phase, amplitude signal, domain structure, and domain switching of the films were measured by piezoresponse force microscope (PFM, MFP-3D, Asylum Research, America) at a scanning frequency of 1 Hz. The quasi-static piezoelectric coefficient d 33 of PMN-PZT thin films was measured by a normal load method and details can be found in our previous work. The direction of the applied force was applied perpendicular to the film surface, and the quasi-static piezoelectric coefficient d 33 was calculated from the following piezoelectric equation: during the d 33 test, the sample electrode area was 3.14 mmE^{2} and the test frequency was 6 Hz.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The annealing temperature dependence of the structure and electrical properties for the 600 nm-thick PMN-PZT thin films were first studied. shows the XRD \u03b8-2\u03b8 patterns of the LNO-buffered substrate, as-grown PMN-PZT thin film and the films annealed at 600 \xb0C, 650 \xb0C, 700 \xb0C for 30 mins, respectively. It can be found that the unannealed PMN-PZT films displayed pyrochlore phase. After annealing, the films exhibited characteristic peaks near 22\xb0 and 45\xb0, which corresponded to the <100> and <200> orientations of the perovskite phase, indicating that PMN-PZT possessed a pure phase structure and <100>-oriented growth. This indicated that the <100>-texture of LNO buffer layer promoted the <100>-oriented growth of PMN-PZT due to the good lattice matching, which can promote the transformation of the pyrochlore phase into perovskite. From , the characteristic peaks of the PMN-PZT thin films obtained at 600 \xb0C and 650 \xb0C were sharp and narrow, suggesting that the rapid annealing process significantly enhanced the crystallinity, and the orientation degree along <100> direction was notably high. When the annealing temperature further increased to 700 \xb0C, the relative characteristic peak intensity of the film weakened, which might be attributed to the volatilization of lead element at higher annealing temperature. Also it can be seen that the <200> diffraction peak of LNO moves rightwards from 46\xb0 to 48\xb0 with the increase of annealing temperature, and this process was related to the increased in-plane lattice expansion of the LNO annealed at higher temperature. According to the Poisson\u2019s ratio, the out-of-plane crystal lattice decreased and the characteristic peak shifted to higher angle position. shows the surface topography of 600 nm-thick unannealed PMN-PZT thin films and films annealing at 600 \xb0C, 650 \xb0C, 700 \xb0C, respectively. Compared to the annealed thin films, the as-deposited films exhibited smaller grain sizes (about 137.4 nm). It is evident that an escalation in the annealing temperature accompanied with the formation of the perovskite phase and a progressive increase of the grain size (203 nm at annealing temperature of 600 \xb0C and 277 nm at annealing temperature of 650 \xb0C). Upon reaching an annealing temperature of 700 \xb0C, the pores appeared. This indicated that at elevated temperatures, the substantial evaporation of lead element led to lead vacancy defects, which in turn, had a detrimental impact on the crystallinity along with the microscale morphology of the thin films. shows the frequency dependence of the dielectric constant (\u03b5 33 T/ \u03b5 0) and dissipation factor (tan\u03b4) of the 600 nm-thick PMN-PZT thin films at distinct annealing temperatures. The typical values of \u03b5 33 T/ \u03b5 0 (tan\u03b4) at 1 kHz for films annealed at 600 \xb0C, 650 \xb0C, and 700 \xb0C were measured to be 1106 (0.032), 1319 (0.034), and 1582 (0.06), respectively. An increase in the annealing temperature resulted in a gradual rise in the dielectric constant of the PMN-PZT thin films, suggesting that elevated annealing conditions were conducive to the enhancement of grain growth and the improvement of crystalline quality. Nevertheless, upon further elevation of the annealing temperature to 700 \xb0C, the tan\u03b4 increased. The polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loops of the 600 nm-thick PMN-PZT thin films annealed between 600 and 700 \xb0C are depicted in. At 1 kHz, the remnant polarization (P r) and the coercive electric field (E C) of the films were measured to be 29 \u03bcC/ cmE^{2} (7.5 kV/mm), 40 \u03bcC/ cmE^{2} (7.5 kV/mm), and 41 \u03bcC/ cmE^{2} (7.2 kV/mm) under the electric field of 80 kV/mm, 80 kV/mm, and 30 kV/mm, respectively. Examination of the revealed that the films annealed at temperatures of 600 \xb0C and 650 \xb0C exhibited the characteristic rectangular hysteresis loops, indicative of a ferroelectric behavior. However, the thin film subjected to annealing at a temperature of 700 \xb0C demonstrated a reduced breakdown field and couldn\u2019t endure the 80 kV/mm electric field. During our experiments, the annealing time dependence of the structure and electrical properties for the PMN-PZT thin films were also performed at fixed annealing temperature of 650 \xb0C. shows the XRD \u03b8-2\u03b8 patterns of the 600 nm-thick PMN-PZT thin films annealed at 650 \xb0C for 20 mins, 30 mins and 40 mins. It can be observed that the PMN-PZT thin films subjected to annealing for 30 mins exhibited relatively higher diffraction intensity for the <100> and <200> peaks compared to those annealed for other durations. The thin film annealed for 20 mins exhibited irregular large grain protrusions, which may be attributed to the insufficient annealing time that limited the energy migration and diffusion of the grains. Under the 30 mins and 40 mins annealing duration, larger grain size could be observed and there were more pores in the sample annealed for 40 mins compared to that annealed for 30 mins. These observations were also consistent with the cross-sectional views presented in (d)-(f). displays the dielectric spectrum of the PMN-PZT thin films annealing at 650 \xb0C for different durations. The typical values of \u03b5 33 T/ \u03b5 0 (tan\u03b4) at 1 kHz for films annealed for 20 mins, 30 mins, and 40 mins were measured to be 939 (0.030), 1259 (0.034), and 1319 (0.036), respectively. It is observable that the dielectric constant of the films increased significantly with the increase of annealing time, while the dielectric loss increased slightly. illustrates the P-E hysteresis loops of the 600 nm-thick PMN-PZT thin films fabricated under various annealing durations at room temperature. It is observed that the PMN-PZT thin films annealed for 20 mins, 30 mins, and 40 mins all exhibited typical rectangular hysteresis loops. At 1 kHz, the remnant polarization (P r) and the coercive electric field (E C) of the films were measured to be 22 \u03bcC/ cmE^{2} (6.0 kV/mm), 41 \u03bcC/ cmE^{2} (7.2 kV/mm), and 40 \u03bcC/ cmE^{2} (7.5 kV/mm), respectively. At an annealing time of 30 mins, the film saturated under a bias field of 90 kV/mm and had a high breakdown resistance. However, when the annealing time was increased to 40 mins, the breakdown field strength of the films decreased substantially. The results indicated that the PMN-PZT thin films annealed at 650 \xb0C for 30 mins possessed relatively superior global electrical properties. Considering that films with thickness of micrometer-thick were required for piezoelectric MEMS applications, in this work, the thickness-dependent electrical properties of PMN-PZT films were investigated. (a) shows the XRD \u03b8-2\u03b8 patterns of PMN-PZT with 200 nm, 600 nm, and 1500 nm, respectively. With the increase of film thickness, the relative intensity of <100> and <200> diffraction peaks for PMN-PZT films gradually increased and the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) decreased, demonstrating better crystallization quality. In addition, the <100> and <200> diffraction peaks shifted leftwards with the thickness increasing, indicating the expansion of the out-of-plane c-axis lattice. Because of the difference of the thermal expansion coefficients between the Si and the PMN-PZT, the PMN-PZT thin film on silicon is typically under a tensile strain. Therefore, the interplanar spacing will increase and the characteristic diffraction peaks shifted leftward based on the Bragg equation. shows the cross-sectional morphologies of PMN-PZT thin films. From the images, it can be observed that the interfaces of PMN-PZT thin films were clear, and the films owned dense morphologies. In (a), it can be seen that the 200 nm thick films owned smaller grains with more porosity. (b) and (c) indicated that as the thickness of the film increased, accompanied by an increase in the sputtering time at 550 \xb0C, the thermal budget also increased and the porosity within the films decreased. When the film thickness reached 1500 nm, the structure of the upper layer of the film resembled the morphology of an epitaxial-grown film on a single-crystal substrate. This was also related with the reduction of substrate clamping with increased thickness, allowing the grains to grow more uniformly. shows the dielectric constant \u03b5 33 T/ \u03b5 0 and loss (tan\u03b4) of the PMN-PZT thin films under different thickness with the frequency range from 0.1 to 100 kHz. At 1 kHz, the dielectric constant and loss of PMN-PZT thin films were 846 (0.036), 1319 (0.034), and 1398 (0.036), under the thickness of 200 nm, 600 nm, and 1200 nm. The results indicated that the ratio of \u03b5 33 T/ \u03b5 0 showed a gradually increasing trend. The polarization-electric field (P-E) loops of PMN-PZT thin films under 200 nm, 600 nm, and 1500 nm are shown in. The P r and E C of PMN-PZT films for the three thickness under 1 kHz were 16 \u03bcC/ cmE^{2} (7 kV/mm), 40 \u03bcC/ cmE^{2} (7.5 kV/mm), 49 \u03bcC/ cmE^{2} (5.7 kV/mm), respectively. As the thickness increased, the remnant polarization of the PMN-PZT thin films tended to strengthen. The substrate clamping releasing made the switching of ferroelectric domains easier, accompanied with enhanced macroscopic ferroelectric properties. (a)-(j) presents the surface morphology, out-of-plane PFM amplitude and phase images of 600 nm-thick and 1500 nm-thick PMN-PZT thin films in 3\xd73 \u03bcmE^{2} area. The out-of-plane phase images demonstrated that the 600 nm-thick PMN-PZT thin film exhibited irregular domain patterns and nano-size domain could be detected. With the thickness increased to 1500 nm, ferroelectric domain size increased. To observe the evolution of domain switching in PMN-PZT thin films, in-situ negative voltages were written in the central area of 1 \xd7 1 \u03bcmE^{2}, and the same positive voltage was written in the external area of 2 \xd7 2 \u03bcmE^{2}. From the out-of-plane phase images, it can be seen that when the DC poling voltage exceeded the coercive voltage, clear polarization inversion can be observed. Under a direct voltage of \xb112 V, the phase images of 1500 nm-thick film exhibited a pronounced contrast between the central and outer square regions, indicative of complete ferroelectric domain switching. While for the 600 nm-thick PMN-PZT thin films, a relatively higher voltage of 16 V is required. To measure the piezoelectric coefficient of micrometer-thick PMN-PZT, an Au electrodes was sputtered onto the surface of the 1.5 \u03bcm thick PMN-PZT thin film. The polarization conditions were set at 10 kV/mm with a temperature of 140 \xb0C and a polarization duration of 5 mins. Upward and downward DC electric fields were applied to the PMN-PZT thin films, respectively. After that, the piezoelectric coefficients of the PMN-PZT thin films were compared shown in (b). It can be observed that for the non-polarized film, weak piezoelectric response with effective d 33 of 85 pC/N was detected, indicating slightly self-polarization characteristics in the as-prepared film. Here the highest piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) poled upward can reached up to 484 pC/N, which showed a two-fold enhancement relative to the commercial Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 and previously-reported Mn-doped 0.36Pb(In1/2Nb1/2)O3-0.36Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3 thin films measured using the same method. The excellent piezoelectric performance and high quality make the PMN-PZT film great potential in application to advanced piezoelectric MEMS devices.

The results indicated that the PMN-PZT thin films annealed at 650 \xb0C for 30 mins possessed relatively superior global electrical properties. Considering that films with thickness of micrometer-thick were required for piezoelectric MEMS applications, in this work, the thickness-dependent electrical properties of PMN-PZT films were investigated. (a) shows the XRD \u03b8-2\u03b8 patterns of PMN-PZT with 200 nm, 600 nm, and 1500 nm, respectively. With the increase of film thickness, the relative intensity of <100> and <200> diffraction peaks for PMN-PZT films gradually increased and the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) decreased, demonstrating better crystallization quality. In addition, the <100> and <200> diffraction peaks shifted leftwards with the thickness increasing, indicating the expansion of the out-of-plane c-axis lattice. Because of the difference of the thermal expansion coefficients between the Si and the PMN-PZT, the PMN-PZT thin film on silicon is typically under a tensile strain. Therefore, the interplanar spacing will increase and the characteristic diffraction peaks shifted leftward based on the Bragg equation. shows the cross-sectional morphologies of PMN-PZT thin films. From the images, it can be observed that the interfaces of PMN-PZT thin films were clear, and the films owned dense morphologies. In (a), it can be seen that the 200 nm thick films owned smaller grains with more porosity. (b) and (c) indicated that as the thickness of the film increased, accompanied by an increase in the sputtering time at 550 \xb0C, the thermal budget also increased and the porosity within the films decreased. When the film thickness reached 1500 nm, the structure of the upper layer of the film resembled the morphology of an epitaxial-grown film on a single-crystal substrate. This was also related with the reduction of substrate clamping with increased thickness, allowing the grains to grow more uniformly. shows the dielectric constant \u03b5 33 T/ \u03b5 0 and loss (tan\u03b4) of the PMN-PZT thin films under different thickness with the frequency range from 0.1 to 100 kHz. At 1 kHz, the dielectric constant and loss of PMN-PZT thin films were 846 (0.036), 1319 (0.034), and 1398 (0.036), under the thickness of 200 nm, 600 nm, and 1200 nm. The results indicated that the ratio of \u03b5 33 T/ \u03b5 0 showed a gradually increasing trend. The polarization-electric field (P-E) loops of PMN-PZT thin films under 200 nm, 600 nm, and 1500 nm are shown in. The P r and E C of PMN-PZT films for the three thickness under 1 kHz were 16 \u03bcC/ cmE^{2} (7 kV/mm), 40 \u03bcC/ cmE^{2} (7.5 kV/mm), 49 \u03bcC/ cmE^{2} (5.7 kV/mm), respectively. As the thickness increased, the remnant polarization of the PMN-PZT thin films tended to strengthen. The substrate clamping releasing made the switching of ferroelectric domains easier, accompanied with enhanced macroscopic ferroelectric properties. (a)-(j) presents the surface morphology, out-of-plane PFM amplitude and phase images of 600 nm-thick and 1500 nm-thick PMN-PZT thin films in 3\xd73 \u03bcmE^{2} area. The out-of-plane phase images demonstrated that the 600 nm-thick PMN-PZT thin film exhibited irregular domain patterns and nano-size domain could be detected. With the thickness increased to 1500 nm, ferroelectric domain size increased. To observe the evolution of domain switching in PMN-PZT thin films, in-situ negative voltages were written in the central area of 1 \xd7 1 \u03bcmE^{2}, and the same positive voltage was written in the external area of 2 \xd7 2 \u03bcmE^{2}. From the out-of-plane phase images, it can be seen that when the DC poling voltage exceeded the coercive voltage, clear polarization inversion can be observed. Under a direct voltage of \xb112 V, the phase images of 1500 nm-thick film exhibited a pronounced contrast between the central and outer square regions, indicative of complete ferroelectric domain switching. While for the 600 nm-thick PMN-PZT thin films, a relatively higher voltage of 16 V is required. To measure the piezoelectric coefficient of micrometer-thick PMN-PZT, an Au electrodes was sputtered onto the surface of the 1.5 \u03bcm thick PMN-PZT thin film. The polarization conditions were set at 10 kV/mm with a temperature of 140 \xb0C and a polarization duration of 5 mins. Upward and downward DC electric fields were applied to the PMN-PZT thin films, respectively. After that, the piezoelectric coefficients of the PMN-PZT thin films were compared shown in (b). It can be observed that for the non-polarized film, weak piezoelectric response with effective d 33 of 85 pC/N was detected, indicating slightly self-polarization characteristics in the as-prepared film. Here the highest piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) poled upward can reached up to 484 pC/N, which showed a two-fold enhancement relative to the commercial Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 and previously-reported Mn-doped 0.36Pb(In1/2Nb1/2)O3-0.36Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3 thin films measured using the same method. The excellent piezoelectric performance and high quality make the PMN-PZT film great potential in application to advanced piezoelectric MEMS devices.
