# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a) shows the XRD patterns of KNEN ceramics with varying K and Na contents (x = 0.99, 1.00, and 1.01). The XRD pattern for the ceramic with x = 1.00 indicates a pure perovskite structure without any secondary phases. In contrast, XRD patterns for ceramics with x = 0.99 and 1.01 reveal a perovskite structure along with a secondary phase, with peaks marked by (peak position at 25\xb0 to 30\xb0). This secondary phase corresponds to a tungsten bronze-type structure of K6Nb10.9O30, which is associated with an A-site deficient state of KNbO3. The secondary phase of the x = 0.99 ceramic is already present in the calcined powder, as shown in. This indicates a K and Na deficiency in the calcined powder state of the x = 0.99 ceramic. In contrast, the x = 1.00 ceramic exhibits a single perovskite structure in both the calcined powder and sintered ceramic, indicating a stoichiometric composition throughout the process. For the x = 1.01 ceramic, the secondary phase was only detected in the sintered ceramic, because of the residual K and/or Na reacting during the sintering process. Interestingly, the lattice constants of KNEN changed with x. (b) shows the (200) and (020) peaks from 44.5 to 46.5E^{\xb0}. The double peaks are typical reflection patterns of orthorhombic phase of KNN ceramic with Amm2 space group. Although the peak centers are nearly identical for x = 0.99 and x = 1.00, the peak centers of the (200) and (020) planes of the of x = 1.01 ceramic are shifted to a higher angle from the peak center of (200) and (020) x = 1.00. This implies that the lattice constant of the x = 1.01 ceramic is also considerably smaller lattice constant compared with the x = 1.00. For the quantitative analysis of the structural properties, we employed the Rietveld refinement of the XRD patterns of the x = 1.00 KNEN. The x = 1.00 ceramic is fitted with an orthorhombic phase (Amm2) and their reliability factors are R wp = 16.9 and \u03c7E^{2} = 1.58. The lattice parameters are calculated with a = 3.944 \xc5, b = 5.636 \xc5 and c = 5.661 \xc5. The Rietveld refinement analysis for both x = 0.99 and x = 1.01, and the results are presented in (a) and (b). For the x = 0.99 ceramic, the refinement indicates that the composition consists of 91.8 % KNN and 8.2 % KN. In the case of the x = 1.01 ceramic, the analysis shows a composition of 95.4 % KNN and 4.6 % KN. We also synthesized powders at x = 0.98 and 1.02 by conventional solid solution method, as detailed in the experiment part.. Presents the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the KNEN powders across various compositions, specifically x = 0.98, 0.99, 1.00, 1.01, and 1.02. Notably, the x = 0.98 and 0.99 compositions exhibited distinct peaks corresponding to the secondary phase K6Nb10.9O30. In contrast, the x = 1.00, 1.01, and 1.02 compositions did not display evidence of secondary phases. The XRD results for the sintered ceramics are illustrated in. The samples with x = 0.98 and 0.99 again show the presence of the secondary phase, while the x = 1.00 composition solely exhibits an orthorhombic phase. Additionally, the x = 1.01 and 1.02 samples also display secondary phase peaks. The SEM images of KNEN are shown in (a)\u2013(c). The physical properties of the ceramics, including the crystal structure and the ferroelectric, piezoelectric, dielectric, and optical properties, are significantly affected by the grain distribution and ceramic density. (a) \u2013 (c), show that the number of pores decreased with an increase in the Na and K contents from x = 0.99 to x = 1.00. Conversely, the number of pores increased from x = 1.00 to x = 1.01. Uniform grain sizes were observed in x = 1.00 ((b)). The grain size of the KNEN ceramics was analyzed through SEM images in. It was found that most grain sizes across all compositions are below 1 \u03bcm. Specifically, the mean grain sizes were measured as follows: 0.895 \u03bcm for x = 0.99, 0.801 \u03bcm for x = 1.00, and 0.796 \u03bcm for x = 1.01. The ceramic densities of the sintered samples were measured using Archimedes\u2019 method. The density of the x = 0.99 ceramic was measured at 4.36 g/cmE^{3}, whereas the density increased to 4.48 g/cmE^{3} for x = 1.00, achieving a relative density of 97 %. Further, the density decreased to 4.38 for x = 1.01. The high densification of the KNN ceramic is attributed to the addition of Na2O and K2O. In the case of x = 0.98 (4.15 g/cmE^{3}) and 1.02 (4.21 g/cmE^{3}), the ceramic density is smaller than x = 0.99 and 1.01 as shown in. Additionally, the cell volume of the secondary phase K\u2086Nb\u2081\u2080.\u2089O\u2083\u2080 is 624 \xc5\xb3, which is considerably larger than that of (K\u2080.\u2085Na\u2080.\u2085)NbO\u2083, which has a cell volume of 125 \xc5\xb3. This phenomenon may result in a reduction of the overall relative density of the ceramic, highlighting the intricate balance between phase composition, microstructure, and densification in the processing of KNEN ceramics. The ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of KNEN ceramics with x = 0.99, 1.00, and 1.01 are shown in. Ferroelectric hysteresis loops are measured at 1 Hz at room temperature ((a)). The ferroelectric properties are characterized by remnant polarization (2P r), saturated polarization (2P s), and coercive field (2E C). As shown in (a), the highest values of 2P r and 2P s were observed for x = 1.00 composition, with 2P r and 2P s values of 41 and 56 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, respectively, as summarized in (b). The lowest coercive field (2E c) of 18.7 kV/cm is observed x = 1.00. The piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) shown in (c), was measured 24 h after poling with a DC bias. d 33 reached its highest value of 135 pC/N at x = 1.00. Further, the electromechanical coupling coefficient (k p) and phase angle (\u03b8) were measured for poled ceramics, as shown in (d). The k p was maximized at x = 1.00, and the highest phase maximum (\u03b8 max) was observed at this composition. In this state, the relationship is given by: where \u03b5 0, \u03b5 r, Q 33, and P s represent the dielectric permittivity of free space, relative permittivity, electrostrictive constants, and saturated polarization, respectively. According to , the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 is directly proportional to P s. Therefore, the d 33 value for x = 1.00 is the highest compared to those of the x = 0.99 and x = 1.01 ceramics. The electromechanical coupling coefficient (k p) represents the efficiency of the electromechanical transduction and is proportional to the piezoelectric coefficient. (c) shows that k p reaches its maximum value at x = 1.00. The phase angle (\u03b8 max) changes from \u221290\xb0 to 90\xb0 (\u03b8 max = 90\xb0). The optimal K and Na content in KNEN ceramics results in the highest \u03b8 max. Therefore, the observed ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and electromechanical coupling properties are consistent with the XRD results. shows the PLE and PL spectra of KNEN ceramics with x = 0.99, 1.00, and 1.01. The PLE spectra were obtained by monitoring the 613 nm emission (E^{5}D0 \u2192 E^{7}F2 in EuE^{3+}). (a) shows an intense peak at 465 nm (E^{7}F0 \u2192 E^{5}D2 in EuE^{3+}). On excitation at 465 nm, five typical emission bands were observed at 579, 593, 615, 650, and 700 nm, respectively. The peaks were assigned to the transitions of E^{5}D0 \u2192 E^{7}FJ (J = 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4) in sequence. The highest PLE and PL intensities in KNEN were observed for x = 1.00. For accurate comparisons of PL intensity among samples, it is essential to ensure uniform photoexcitation volumes (or uniform sample thickness). The density variation across our samples is only 2 %, indicating that the photoexcitation volumes are nearly identical for all three samples. However, the observed 60 % variation in PL intensities significantly exceeds the density variation. This suggests that the maximum PL intensity observed at x = 1.00 is primarily due to the intrinsic properties of the samples. Additionally, we measured the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and found that the PLQY is highest for the x = 1.00 sample, as shown in. This further confirms that the highest PL intensity at x = 1.00 is an intrinsic property of the material. The highest PL signal at x = 1.00 implies that optimal K and Na contents and the absence of any secondary phase are important for luminescent as well as the ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties. We discussed the PC behavior of KNEN. The PC behavior is characterized by color conversion after irradiation with a short-wavelength light (e.g., UV light), which is typically associated with the generation of electron\u2013hole pairs or a phase transition. In KNEN, electrons excited by UV light are trapped at defect sites, whereas holes are captured by A-site defects, such as those from potassium (K) and sodium (Na) volatilization or europium (Eu) ion transitions. We measured the XPS spectra to confirm the existence of the oxygen vacancy within the samples. The oxygen peaks are calibrated by the C1s peak, which serves as a reference for each sample. The peaks were deconvoluted using the xpspeak 4.1 program. The peaks were fitted with two modes originating from the lattice oxygen (O1), and the oxygen vacancies (O2). Our samples exhibited good PC behavior. As shown in (a) \u2013 (c), there was a notable reduction in the reflectivity across the 400\u20131000 nm range after UV irradiation at 380 nm for 3 min, which led to the coloration of our samples. \u0394R was calculated to quantify the degree of color change using the formula \u0394R = (R 0 \u2212 R t) \xd7 100 %, where R 0 and R t represent the reflectivity at 500 nm before and after UV irradiation, respectively. The highest \u0394R value was observed for the x = 1.00 sample, which reached 43 % ((d)). When the colored sample was heated up to 200 \xb0C and annealed for 300 seconds, the reflectivity spectra returned to the original level, and the broad absorption in range of 400 \u2013 1000 nm disappeared, thereby effectively bleaching the gray coloration. The PC behavior of the KNEN significantly influenced its PL properties. shows the PL spectrum of KNEN after the UV light irradiation for 3 min. After UV irradiation, the luminescence intensity decreased, although the shape and peak positions of the PL spectra remained unchanged. The change in luminescence intensity can be quantified using where I 0 and I t represent the initial emission peak intensities at 593, 615 nm and after the UV light irradiation, respectively. The \u0394Idec of KNEN were estimated to be 69, 80, and 72 % for x = 0.99, 1.00, and 1.01, respectively, indicating that the PL modulation was the largest at x = 1.00. Further, we observed that the PL intensity could be restored by a bleaching process involving thermal excitation. When the samples were heated to 200 \xb0C, the luminescence intensity increased significantly, whereas the shape and peak positions of the PL spectra remained unchanged. reveals the five cycles of PL modulation for the KNEN sample under alternating 380 nm UV irradiation and thermal excitation up to 200 \xb0C. The results indicate no significant degradation in \u0394Idec and only minor fluctuations, demonstrating the excellent repeatability of the KNEN material. Therefore, our results indicate that KNEN ceramics have potential applications in erasable optical storage devices. We found that the PC behaviors of the samples can also be induced by X-ray irradiation , similar to that with UV irradiation. When exposed to X-rays (\u03bbex = 1.54184 \xc5), the samples turned gray, indicating the occurrence of PC behavior. Simultaneously, as shown in (b), the PL intensity decreased, which is comparable to the reduction observed under UV irradiation ((a)). Upon heating the samples to 200 \xb0C, the gray coloration was bleached, and the PL intensity returned to its original level. These results indicate that our samples exhibited PC behaviors and related PL modulation under both UV light and X-ray irradiation. We measured the temperature-dependent dielectric permittivity (\u03b5) and dielectric loss (tan \u03b4) of KNEN for x = 1.00 up to T = 220 \xb0C. As shown in (a), the dielectric permittivity of KNEN exhibited a broad peak near Tm = 180 \u2013 200 \xb0C, which corresponds to the transition from the orthorhombic to the tetragonal phase. The T-dependent PL spectra of the x = 0.01 sample were measured. The PL peaks were suppressed with increasing temperature. For further insight, we estimated the ratio of the PL intensities at 595 and 615 nm, which corresponds to an asymmetric ratio. Further, we examined the relative PL intensities at 595 and 615 nm with respect to that at703 nm ((c)). These findings indicate that the PL spectra of KNEN reflect the underlying structural phase transitions.

# TITLE
Synthesis and characterization of Eu-doped (K<inf>0.5</inf>Na<inf>0.5</inf>)NbO<inf>3</inf> ceramics with enhanced ferroelectric, photochromic, and luminescent properties

# ABSTRACT
The presence of secondary phases in rare-earth ion-doped potassium sodium niobate ((K0.5Na0.5)NbO3, KNN) ceramics limit its electronic applications. To address this limitation, we investigated the electronic and luminescence properties of Eu3+-doped KNN (KNEN) ceramics. We synthesized a high-purity perovskite phase of KNEN without secondary phases by carefully adjusting the Na and K concentrations with 1â¯mol% Eu. KNEN ceramics demonstrated excellent ferroelectric and luminescent properties, including a photochromic effect that presented reversible color changes on exposure to ultraviolet light and X-rays. Further, we observed a strong correlation between the electric and luminescent properties near the orthorhombic-tetragonal phase transition at â¼200 Â°C. These results suggest that KNEN ceramics are promising Pb-free luminescent piezoelectric materials.

# INTRODUCTION
Lead-based piezoelectric ceramics, such as Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT), exhibit excellent ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties, making them suitable for applications in ultrasound, sensors, and actuators. Potassium sodium niobate (K0.5Na0.5NbO3, KNN) is Pb-free piezoelectric ceramics that can potentially replace PZT ceramics. KNN has attracted significant research attention because of its excellent piezoelectric constant and high Curie temperature, comparable to those of Pb-containing ferroelectrics. The outstanding properties of KNN make it suitable for applications in actuators and sensors , energy harvesting , and memory devices. When KNN is synthesized using the conventional solid-state reaction method, K and Na ions can volatilize at very high temperatures. Co-doping cations with rare-earth (RE) ions is an effective approach for suppressing the cation deficiency and increasing the piezoelectric properties. Therefore, understanding the simple RE doping effect of KNN ceramics is necessary to applying them to modified KNN systems. Rutkowski et al. produced highly dense ceramics via doping with RE ions such as, ErE^{3+} and YbE^{3+}, and modifying the fabrication process. The EuE^{3+}-doped K1-x Na x NbO3 (x = 0.42\u20130.56) ceramic showed the highest piezoelectric property at x = 0.50. The highest Curie temperature was observed for a 1 mol% Eu\u2013doped KNN ceramic. A small amount of the impurity phase can be observed in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns because of the volatilization of the K and Na during the high-temperature heat-treatment process. The melting point of KNbO3 (T m = 1050 \xb0C) is lower than of NaNbO3 (T m = 1422 \xb0C). In addition, RE-doped KNN ceramics require a 50\u2013100 \xb0C higher sintering temperature than that of undoped KNN ceramics to achieve high densification. This increased sintering temperature exceeds the melting point of the KNN ceramics, which is \u223c1140 \xb0C. The KNN ceramic exhibits a phase transition from the orthorhombic to the tetragonal (T O-T) phase at 200 \xb0C and from the tetragonal to cubic (T T-C) phase at 420 \xb0C. In addition, multi-ion doping or a solid solution with another ABO3 is required to improve the temperature stability of piezoelectric properties. Recently, RE doped lead-free piezoelectric ceramics have attracted considerable research attention because of their novel optical properties such as transparency, photoluminescence, and photochromism, along with their original electrical properties. Among RE ions, trivalent europium (EuE^{3+}) ions are notable for their orange-red emission spectra, which originate from the 4f-4f transitions (E^{5}D0\u2013E^{7}FJ, J = 0\u20135). The crystal structure of the host material affects the emission characteristics of EuE^{3+} because of the high sensitivity of the 4f-4f transition to the local lattice structure. KNN is a promising photoluminescent host because its low phonon energy and high thermal resistance. (K0.5Na0.5)1-x Eu x NbO3 (x = 0.02\u20130.30) ceramics exhibit photochromism and energy storage behavior with a secondary phase (EuNbO4). The xEu-KNN (x = 1\u20134 %) exhibits optical transmittance and photochromic (PC) behavior. In this study, (K0.50Na0.50) x Eu0.01NbO3 (KNEN) ceramics with x = 0.99, 1.00, and 1.01 were synthesized using the conventional solid-state reaction method. In addition, photochromism and related photoluminescence (PL) modulation under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation were observed, which were attributed to the effect of EuE^{3+} doping.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a) shows the XRD patterns of KNEN ceramics with varying K and Na contents (x = 0.99, 1.00, and 1.01). The XRD pattern for the ceramic with x = 1.00 indicates a pure perovskite structure without any secondary phases. In contrast, XRD patterns for ceramics with x = 0.99 and 1.01 reveal a perovskite structure along with a secondary phase, with peaks marked by (peak position at 25\xb0 to 30\xb0). This secondary phase corresponds to a tungsten bronze-type structure of K6Nb10.9O30, which is associated with an A-site deficient state of KNbO3. The secondary phase of the x = 0.99 ceramic is already present in the calcined powder, as shown in. This indicates a K and Na deficiency in the calcined powder state of the x = 0.99 ceramic. In contrast, the x = 1.00 ceramic exhibits a single perovskite structure in both the calcined powder and sintered ceramic, indicating a stoichiometric composition throughout the process. For the x = 1.01 ceramic, the secondary phase was only detected in the sintered ceramic, because of the residual K and/or Na reacting during the sintering process. Interestingly, the lattice constants of KNEN changed with x. (b) shows the (200) and (020) peaks from 44.5 to 46.5E^{\xb0}. The double peaks are typical reflection patterns of orthorhombic phase of KNN ceramic with Amm2 space group. Although the peak centers are nearly identical for x = 0.99 and x = 1.00, the peak centers of the (200) and (020) planes of the of x = 1.01 ceramic are shifted to a higher angle from the peak center of (200) and (020) x = 1.00. This implies that the lattice constant of the x = 1.01 ceramic is also considerably smaller lattice constant compared with the x = 1.00. For the quantitative analysis of the structural properties, we employed the Rietveld refinement of the XRD patterns of the x = 1.00 KNEN. The x = 1.00 ceramic is fitted with an orthorhombic phase (Amm2) and their reliability factors are R wp = 16.9 and \u03c7E^{2} = 1.58. The lattice parameters are calculated with a = 3.944 \xc5, b = 5.636 \xc5 and c = 5.661 \xc5. The Rietveld refinement analysis for both x = 0.99 and x = 1.01, and the results are presented in (a) and (b). For the x = 0.99 ceramic, the refinement indicates that the composition consists of 91.8 % KNN and 8.2 % KN. In the case of the x = 1.01 ceramic, the analysis shows a composition of 95.4 % KNN and 4.6 % KN. We also synthesized powders at x = 0.98 and 1.02 by conventional solid solution method, as detailed in the experiment part.. Presents the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the KNEN powders across various compositions, specifically x = 0.98, 0.99, 1.00, 1.01, and 1.02. Notably, the x = 0.98 and 0.99 compositions exhibited distinct peaks corresponding to the secondary phase K6Nb10.9O30. In contrast, the x = 1.00, 1.01, and 1.02 compositions did not display evidence of secondary phases. The XRD results for the sintered ceramics are illustrated in. The samples with x = 0.98 and 0.99 again show the presence of the secondary phase, while the x = 1.00 composition solely exhibits an orthorhombic phase. Additionally, the x = 1.01 and 1.02 samples also display secondary phase peaks. The SEM images of KNEN are shown in (a)\u2013(c). The physical properties of the ceramics, including the crystal structure and the ferroelectric, piezoelectric, dielectric, and optical properties, are significantly affected by the grain distribution and ceramic density. (a) \u2013 (c), show that the number of pores decreased with an increase in the Na and K contents from x = 0.99 to x = 1.00. Conversely, the number of pores increased from x = 1.00 to x = 1.01. Uniform grain sizes were observed in x = 1.00 ((b)). The grain size of the KNEN ceramics was analyzed through SEM images in. It was found that most grain sizes across all compositions are below 1 \u03bcm. Specifically, the mean grain sizes were measured as follows: 0.895 \u03bcm for x = 0.99, 0.801 \u03bcm for x = 1.00, and 0.796 \u03bcm for x = 1.01. The ceramic densities of the sintered samples were measured using Archimedes\u2019 method. The density of the x = 0.99 ceramic was measured at 4.36 g/cmE^{3}, whereas the density increased to 4.48 g/cmE^{3} for x = 1.00, achieving a relative density of 97 %. Further, the density decreased to 4.38 for x = 1.01. The high densification of the KNN ceramic is attributed to the addition of Na2O and K2O. In the case of x = 0.98 (4.15 g/cmE^{3}) and 1.02 (4.21 g/cmE^{3}), the ceramic density is smaller than x = 0.99 and 1.01 as shown in. Additionally, the cell volume of the secondary phase K\u2086Nb\u2081\u2080.\u2089O\u2083\u2080 is 624 \xc5\xb3, which is considerably larger than that of (K\u2080.\u2085Na\u2080.\u2085)NbO\u2083, which has a cell volume of 125 \xc5\xb3. This phenomenon may result in a reduction of the overall relative density of the ceramic, highlighting the intricate balance between phase composition, microstructure, and densification in the processing of KNEN ceramics. The ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of KNEN ceramics with x = 0.99, 1.00, and 1.01 are shown in. Ferroelectric hysteresis loops are measured at 1 Hz at room temperature ((a)). The ferroelectric properties are characterized by remnant polarization (2P r), saturated polarization (2P s), and coercive field (2E C). As shown in (a), the highest values of 2P r and 2P s were observed for x = 1.00 composition, with 2P r and 2P s values of 41 and 56 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, respectively, as summarized in (b). The lowest coercive field (2E c) of 18.7 kV/cm is observed x = 1.00. The piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) shown in (c), was measured 24 h after poling with a DC bias. d 33 reached its highest value of 135 pC/N at x = 1.00. Further, the electromechanical coupling coefficient (k p) and phase angle (\u03b8) were measured for poled ceramics, as shown in (d). The k p was maximized at x = 1.00, and the highest phase maximum (\u03b8 max) was observed at this composition. In this state, the relationship is given by: where \u03b5 0, \u03b5 r, Q 33, and P s represent the dielectric permittivity of free space, relative permittivity, electrostrictive constants, and saturated polarization, respectively. According to , the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 is directly proportional to P s. Therefore, the d 33 value for x = 1.00 is the highest compared to those of the x = 0.99 and x = 1.01 ceramics. The electromechanical coupling coefficient (k p) represents the efficiency of the electromechanical transduction and is proportional to the piezoelectric coefficient. (c) shows that k p reaches its maximum value at x = 1.00. The phase angle (\u03b8 max) changes from \u221290\xb0 to 90\xb0 (\u03b8 max = 90\xb0). The optimal K and Na content in KNEN ceramics results in the highest \u03b8 max. Therefore, the observed ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and electromechanical coupling properties are consistent with the XRD results. shows the PLE and PL spectra of KNEN ceramics with x = 0.99, 1.00, and 1.01. The PLE spectra were obtained by monitoring the 613 nm emission (E^{5}D0 \u2192 E^{7}F2 in EuE^{3+}). (a) shows an intense peak at 465 nm (E^{7}F0 \u2192 E^{5}D2 in EuE^{3+}). On excitation at 465 nm, five typical emission bands were observed at 579, 593, 615, 650, and 700 nm, respectively. The peaks were assigned to the transitions of E^{5}D0 \u2192 E^{7}FJ (J = 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4) in sequence. The highest PLE and PL intensities in KNEN were observed for x = 1.00. For accurate comparisons of PL intensity among samples, it is essential to ensure uniform photoexcitation volumes (or uniform sample thickness). The density variation across our samples is only 2 %, indicating that the photoexcitation volumes are nearly identical for all three samples. However, the observed 60 % variation in PL intensities significantly exceeds the density variation. This suggests that the maximum PL intensity observed at x = 1.00 is primarily due to the intrinsic properties of the samples. Additionally, we measured the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and found that the PLQY is highest for the x = 1.00 sample, as shown in. This further confirms that the highest PL intensity at x = 1.00 is an intrinsic property of the material. The highest PL signal at x = 1.00 implies that optimal K and Na contents and the absence of any secondary phase are important for luminescent as well as the ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties. We discussed the PC behavior of KNEN. The PC behavior is characterized by color conversion after irradiation with a short-wavelength light (e.g., UV light), which is typically associated with the generation of electron\u2013hole pairs or a phase transition. In KNEN, electrons excited by UV light are trapped at defect sites, whereas holes are captured by A-site defects, such as those from potassium (K) and sodium (Na) volatilization or europium (Eu) ion transitions. We measured the XPS spectra to confirm the existence of the oxygen vacancy within the samples. The oxygen peaks are calibrated by the C1s peak, which serves as a reference for each sample. The peaks were deconvoluted using the xpspeak 4.1 program. The peaks were fitted with two modes originating from the lattice oxygen (O1), and the oxygen vacancies (O2). Our samples exhibited good PC behavior. As shown in (a) \u2013 (c), there was a notable reduction in the reflectivity across the 400\u20131000 nm range after UV irradiation at 380 nm for 3 min, which led to the coloration of our samples. \u0394R was calculated to quantify the degree of color change using the formula \u0394R = (R 0 \u2212 R t) \xd7 100 %, where R 0 and R t represent the reflectivity at 500 nm before and after UV irradiation, respectively. The highest \u0394R value was observed for the x = 1.00 sample, which reached 43 % ((d)). When the colored sample was heated up to 200 \xb0C and annealed for 300 seconds, the reflectivity spectra returned to the original level, and the broad absorption in range of 400 \u2013 1000 nm disappeared, thereby effectively bleaching the gray coloration. The PC behavior of the KNEN significantly influenced its PL properties. shows the PL spectrum of KNEN after the UV light irradiation for 3 min. After UV irradiation, the luminescence intensity decreased, although the shape and peak positions of the PL spectra remained unchanged. The change in luminescence intensity can be quantified using where I 0 and I t represent the initial emission peak intensities at 593, 615 nm and after the UV light irradiation, respectively. The \u0394Idec of KNEN were estimated to be 69, 80, and 72 % for x = 0.99, 1.00, and 1.01, respectively, indicating that the PL modulation was the largest at x = 1.00. Further, we observed that the PL intensity could be restored by a bleaching process involving thermal excitation. When the samples were heated to 200 \xb0C, the luminescence intensity increased significantly, whereas the shape and peak positions of the PL spectra remained unchanged. reveals the five cycles of PL modulation for the KNEN sample under alternating 380 nm UV irradiation and thermal excitation up to 200 \xb0C. The results indicate no significant degradation in \u0394Idec and only minor fluctuations, demonstrating the excellent repeatability of the KNEN material. Therefore, our results indicate that KNEN ceramics have potential applications in erasable optical storage devices. We found that the PC behaviors of the samples can also be induced by X-ray irradiation , similar to that with UV irradiation. When exposed to X-rays (\u03bbex = 1.54184 \xc5), the samples turned gray, indicating the occurrence of PC behavior. Simultaneously, as shown in (b), the PL intensity decreased, which is comparable to the reduction observed under UV irradiation ((a)). Upon heating the samples to 200 \xb0C, the gray coloration was bleached, and the PL intensity returned to its original level. These results indicate that our samples exhibited PC behaviors and related PL modulation under both UV light and X-ray irradiation. We measured the temperature-dependent dielectric permittivity (\u03b5) and dielectric loss (tan \u03b4) of KNEN for x = 1.00 up to T = 220 \xb0C. As shown in (a), the dielectric permittivity of KNEN exhibited a broad peak near Tm = 180 \u2013 200 \xb0C, which corresponds to the transition from the orthorhombic to the tetragonal phase. The T-dependent PL spectra of the x = 0.01 sample were measured. The PL peaks were suppressed with increasing temperature. For further insight, we estimated the ratio of the PL intensities at 595 and 615 nm, which corresponds to an asymmetric ratio. Further, we examined the relative PL intensities at 595 and 615 nm with respect to that at703 nm ((c)). These findings indicate that the PL spectra of KNEN reflect the underlying structural phase transitions.

Synthesis and characterization of Eu-doped (K<inf>0.5</inf>Na<inf>0.5</inf>)NbO<inf>3</inf> ceramics with enhanced ferroelectric, photochromic, and luminescent properties

# ABSTRACT
The presence of secondary phases in rare-earth ion-doped potassium sodium niobate ((K0.5Na0.5)NbO3, KNN) ceramics limit its electronic applications. To address this limitation, we investigated the electronic and luminescence properties of Eu3+-doped KNN (KNEN) ceramics. We synthesized a high-purity perovskite phase of KNEN without secondary phases by carefully adjusting the Na and K concentrations with 1â¯mol% Eu. KNEN ceramics demonstrated excellent ferroelectric and luminescent properties, including a photochromic effect that presented reversible color changes on exposure to ultraviolet light and X-rays. Further, we observed a strong correlation between the electric and luminescent properties near the orthorhombic-tetragonal phase transition at â¼200 Â°C. These results suggest that KNEN ceramics are promising Pb-free luminescent piezoelectric materials.

# INTRODUCTION
Lead-based piezoelectric ceramics, such as Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT), exhibit excellent ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties, making them suitable for applications in ultrasound, sensors, and actuators. Potassium sodium niobate (K0.5Na0.5NbO3, KNN) is Pb-free piezoelectric ceramics that can potentially replace PZT ceramics. KNN has attracted significant research attention because of its excellent piezoelectric constant and high Curie temperature, comparable to those of Pb-containing ferroelectrics. The outstanding properties of KNN make it suitable for applications in actuators and sensors , energy harvesting , and memory devices. When KNN is synthesized using the conventional solid-state reaction method, K and Na ions can volatilize at very high temperatures. Co-doping cations with rare-earth (RE) ions is an effective approach for suppressing the cation deficiency and increasing the piezoelectric properties. Therefore, understanding the simple RE doping effect of KNN ceramics is necessary to applying them to modified KNN systems. Rutkowski et al. produced highly dense ceramics via doping with RE ions such as, ErE^{3+} and YbE^{3+}, and modifying the fabrication process. The EuE^{3+}-doped K1-x Na x NbO3 (x = 0.42\u20130.56) ceramic showed the highest piezoelectric property at x = 0.50. The highest Curie temperature was observed for a 1 mol% Eu\u2013doped KNN ceramic. A small amount of the impurity phase can be observed in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns because of the volatilization of the K and Na during the high-temperature heat-treatment process. The melting point of KNbO3 (T m = 1050 \xb0C) is lower than of NaNbO3 (T m = 1422 \xb0C). In addition, RE-doped KNN ceramics require a 50\u2013100 \xb0C higher sintering temperature than that of undoped KNN ceramics to achieve high densification. This increased sintering temperature exceeds the melting point of the KNN ceramics, which is \u223c1140 \xb0C. The KNN ceramic exhibits a phase transition from the orthorhombic to the tetragonal (T O-T) phase at 200 \xb0C and from the tetragonal to cubic (T T-C) phase at 420 \xb0C. In addition, multi-ion doping or a solid solution with another ABO3 is required to improve the temperature stability of piezoelectric properties. Recently, RE doped lead-free piezoelectric ceramics have attracted considerable research attention because of their novel optical properties such as transparency, photoluminescence, and photochromism, along with their original electrical properties. Among RE ions, trivalent europium (EuE^{3+}) ions are notable for their orange-red emission spectra, which originate from the 4f-4f transitions (E^{5}D0\u2013E^{7}FJ, J = 0\u20135). The crystal structure of the host material affects the emission characteristics of EuE^{3+} because of the high sensitivity of the 4f-4f transition to the local lattice structure. KNN is a promising photoluminescent host because its low phonon energy and high thermal resistance. (K0.5Na0.5)1-x Eu x NbO3 (x = 0.02\u20130.30) ceramics exhibit photochromism and energy storage behavior with a secondary phase (EuNbO4). The xEu-KNN (x = 1\u20134 %) exhibits optical transmittance and photochromic (PC) behavior. In this study, (K0.50Na0.50) x Eu0.01NbO3 (KNEN) ceramics with x = 0.99, 1.00, and 1.01 were synthesized using the conventional solid-state reaction method. In addition, photochromism and related photoluminescence (PL) modulation under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation were observed, which were attributed to the effect of EuE^{3+} doping.
