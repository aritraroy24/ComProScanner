Just resolve the variables - but don't do any final numerical calculation to get the composition percentage by yourself and keep the formula same as the original.
- If any abbreviated form of composition is present rewrite with the actual composition. But DON'T modify the chemical composition / periodic element with chemical name / element name for e.g., Bi should not be replaced with Bismuth or BaTiO3 should not be replaced with Barium titanate.
- If composition has variables with equation, after resolving the variable the formula should be written in a form of BODMAS rule with only () as brackets, + as addition, - as subtraction, * as multiplication and / as division. For e.g, ABx-2y/5C3 is a chemical formula, where A, B, C are periodic elements and x and y are variables with values x=2, y=3, the final chemical formula should be written as AB(2-((2*3)/5))O3 so that BODMAS rule can be applied later.

", agent="Material Composition and Property Formatter", status="completed", output="Thought: I should first identify if there are any variables in the composition formulas that need to be resolved. The compositions are 'Ni@MoS2', '3–3', '2–2', 'Pd@MoS2', 'Pt@MoS2', 'Ir@MoS2', 'Ni@Bi-MoS2', 'Pd@Bi-MoS2', 'Pt@Bi-MoS2', 'Ir@Bi-MoS2'. Among these, only '3–3' and '2–2' look like they could be variables or formulas, but they seem to be numerical or symbolic placeholders. The others are standard compositions with '@' indicating possibly a dopant or substitution.

Since the abbreviations indicate 'MoS2' and 'Bi-MoS2' are chemical formulas, and the '@' symbol likely indicates a substitution or doping, I will use the Material Formula Parser to resolve any variable formulas if present. The other compositions seem straightforward, but '3–3' and '2–2' are ambiguous; they might be placeholders or misinterpretations.

Given that, I will proceed to parse the compositions with the Material Formula Parser to ensure any variables are resolved, especially for '3–3' and '2–2'.
