You MUST use 'MaterialParserTool' as tool if there is any variable in the composition in {'composition_extracted_data': {'compositions_property_values': {'KNNS-(0.04-x)CZ-xBAZ (x=0)': 447, 'KNNS-(0.04-x)CZ-xBAZ (x=0.01)': 447, 'KNNS-(0.04-x)CZ-xBAZ (x=0.02)': 447, 'KNNS-(0.04-x)CZ-xBAZ (x=0.03)': 447}, 'abbreviations': {'KNNS': '(K0.5Na0.5)(Nb0.96Sb0.04)O3', 'CZ': 'CaZrO3', 'BAZ': '(Bi0.5Ag0.5)ZrO3'}, 'property_unit': 'pC/N', 'family': 'KNN-based lead-free ceramics'}}. You MUST use the final output from the material parser tool as the final answer for such cases. Just resolve the variables - but don't do any final numerical calculation to get the composition percentage by yourself and keep the formula same as the original.
- If any abbreviated form of composition is present rewrite with the actual composition. But DON'T modify the chemical composition / periodic element with chemical name / element name for e.g., Bi should not be replaced with Bismuth or BaTiO3 should not be replaced with Barium titanate.
- If composition has variables with equation, after resolving the variable the formula should be written in a form of BODMAS rule with only () as brackets, + as addition, - as subtraction, * as multiplication and / as division. For e.g, ABx-2y/5C3 is a chemical formula, where A, B, C are periodic elements and x and y are variables with values x=2, y=3, the final chemical formula should be written as AB(2-((2*3)/5))O3 so that BODMAS rule can be applied later.
