Using electrospinning equipped with a grounded rolling collector, nonwoven ES fiber mats of P(VDF-TrFE) 80/20 were prepared from 12 wt% methyl ether ketone (MEK) solution (see in the ). Afterwards, multi-step thermal annealing processes were used to achieve ECCs with thickened ferroelectric domains. Finally, corona-charging was employed to achieve the permanent remanent polarization (Pr0) for piezoelectricity. In the first thermal annealing (1A) process, the ES fiber mat was held isothermally at 140 \xb0C to produce ECCs via chain-sliding motions in the paraelectric phase, as previously reported. Before thermal annealing, the as-spun fiber mat exhibited the melting of secondary (Tm,SC, heat of fusion \u0394Hm,SC = 1.89 J/g) and primary crystals (Tm,PC) at 51.5 and 147.5 \xb0C, respectively. The Curie temperature (TC) was observed to be 119.8 \xb0C, followed by a small exothermic peak at 125.1 \xb0C. This peak could be attributed to the cold crystallization (Tcx, i.e., crystallization upon heating) from the defect structure frozen during the fast electrospinning process, and it was also reported in a uniaxially oriented P(VDF-TrFE) 75/25 film in a previous publication. The TC and Tm of the as-spun fiber mat were apparently lower than those of the melt-crystallized sample after removing the memory of thermal history by the first melting (see b later), indicative of defective ferroelectric domains and folded-chain crystals (FCCs) formed during electrospinning. At 140 \xb0C, a series of isothermal annealing times were chosen: 10, 60, 180, 360, 720, 1440, and 2880 min, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to monitor the effect of thermal annealing time on TC/heat of Curie transition (\u0394HC) and Tm/heat of melting (\u0394Hm); see b and 1c. After 10-min of 1A, dramatic changes took place. First, the Tm,SC and Tcx peaks vanished. As we have discussed before , annealing above Tm,SC could melt secondary crystals and recrystallize them onto the prime crystals for P(VDF-TrFE) 80/20, and thus eliminate the Tcx peak. Second, improvement of crystalline grains and ferroelectric domains happened simultaneously, and this is reflected by the increase of Tm and TC/\u0394HC. Upon further 1A annealing, Tm increased to 152.8 \xb0C, and \u0394Hm increased to 37.6 J/g at 2880 min. However, the situations for TC and \u0394HC were different. Finally, after 2880-min isothermal annealing at 140 \xb0C, we obtained an ECC structure for P(VDF-TrFE) 80/20 with an extremely high crystallinity (x c) of almost 80 % (\u0394Hm = 37.6 J/g, see the powder X-ray data later) and a high Tm of 152.9 \xb0C. The ECC structure was proved by the small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) result in d. The overall lamellar thickness (L), which included both crystalline and amorphous layers, increased significantly from 10.6 nm for the non-annealed P(VDF-TrFE) 80/20 to 80.0 nm for the 140 \xb0C-annealed sample. During this process, the TC decreased to 130.6 \xb0C, \u0394HC was 34.9 J/g, and the Curie peak broadened. The decrease in overall Curie transition temperature is due to the thermal annealing higher than TC. All the samples exhibited the all-trans conformation with peaks at 504, 842, and 1284 cmE^{\u22121}. Their relationship obeys the Gibbs-Thomson equation: Tm = Tm\xb0(1-K/Lc) , where Tm\xb0 is the equilibrium melting temperature and K is a constant related to the folded-chain surface energy and \u0394Hm of 100 % ECC. However, it seems that P(VDF-TrFE) 80/20 did not fit well here. As the lamellar thickness L increased about 7.5 times from FCCs to ECCs (see d), the Tm only increased 5.4 \xb0C. We consider that, as the crystalline lamellae thickened, defective segments with more TrFE units were included in the crystalline region, which could decrease both Tm and \u0394Hm. Although Lc significantly increased for P(VDF-TrFE) 80/20 upon 1A above the TC, the experimental Tm only increased slightly. The second annealing (2A) was carried out for ES1A-2880 min below TC with a fixed isothermal time of 1 day to further increase the ferroelectric domain size. Different from PVDF homopolymers, it is proposed that ferroelectric domains in P(VDF-TrFE) could increase their size upon thermal annealing slightly below TC by enhanced chain-sliding and rotational motions to remove defective domain walls. In this study, the 2A temperatures were chosen as 110, 115, 125, and 130 \xb0C. As seen in a, two TC peaks appeared after the second annealing. For example, for the DSC curve of ES1A2A-110 \xb0C, the main TC (TC1) peak was 130.3 \xb0C and the minor TC (TC2) was 114.8 \xb0C. The TC2 should originate from the \u201cmelting\u201d of poor ferroelectric domains at the 2A temperature. When the 2A temperature increased, the primary ferroelectric domains enlarged in size, increasing both TC1 and \u0394HC1 (b). Meanwhile, more \u201cpoor\u201d ferroelectric domains \u201cmelted\u201d, leading to a higher \u0394HC2. The TC1 reached its maximum value of 139.6 \xb0C upon 2A at 125 \xb0C (b). To quantify the heats of transitions for TC1, TC2, and Tm, PeakfitE^{TM} software was used to calculate \u0394HC,total, \u0394HC2, and \u0394Hm (c). It is noteworthy that after 2A at 125 \xb0C, the total \u0394HC,total increased to \u0394HC,total = \u0394HC1 + \u0394HC2 = 8.27 + 31.77 J/g = 40.04 J/g. The TC1 peak height was comparable to the Tm peak height of the paraelectric crystals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest \u0394HC value ever achieved for P(VDF-TrFE) random copolymers, suggesting the largest ferroelectric domains achieved by the 2-step thermal annealing, as proposed by Ohigashi and coworkers. In the case of Tm, intriguingly only a slight increase (from 152.8 to 153.3 \xb0C) was seen after 2A at 125 \xb0C. This indicated that the ECC paraelectric crystals were not much affected by the 2A step. Finally, after 2A at 130 \xb0C for ES1A2A-130 \xb0C, both TC1 and \u0394HC1 started to decrease, and \u0394HC2 significantly increased (a-c). This is because the 2A temperature was so high that most ferroelectric domains \u201cmelted\u201d. A single-step 2A (i.e., without 1A) was also performed, as shown in a, to compare with the two-step 2A annealing. The highest annealing temperature could only reach 115 \xb0C, and the highest TC achieved 126.3 \xb0C with a low \u0394HC of 18.1 J/g. After that, a similar \u201cmelting\u201d issue of ferroelectric domains was observed. Moreover, the cold crystallization Tcx was still observable, and the Tm was only 148.1 \xb0C. These results showed the importance of the 1A step for the 2A to achieve ECCs with large ferroelectric domains in the electrospun fiber mats of P(VDF-TrFE) 80/20. Tensile mechanical properties of various P(VDF-TrFE) 80/20 fiber mats are presented in d. For the ES and ES2A-115 \xb0C fiber mats with FCCs, the Young\u2019s modulus (Y) values were around 4.5 MPa, and the strains at break were around 45 %. For the ES1A-2880 min fiber mat, ECCs were obtained, and the YES1A increased to 11.2 MPa with a decreased strain at break of 18 %. Finally, for the ES1A2A-125 \xb0C fiber mat with ECCs and the highest crystallinity, the YES1A2A increased to 70 MPa while the strain at break further decreased to 13 %. The increased Young\u2019s modulus and decreased strain at break after extensive thermal annealing should be attributed to the increase crystallinity in the fiber mats. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) was employed to characterize the crystal orientation and crystallinity increase upon thermal annealing. a-d show the 2D WAXD fiber patterns of aligned ES, ES2A-115 \xb0C, ES1A-2880 min, and ES1A2A-125 \xb0C nanofibers, respectively, with the fibers along the vertical direction. The (110/200) reflections of the ferroelectric phase were on the equator, and the (001) reflection was on the meridian. The 2D powder WAXD patterns of different fiber mats are presented in. From the integrated 1D powder WAXD curves in e, the crystallinity x c was quantitively determined using the crystalline-amorphous two-phase model: x c = 0.508 for ES, x c = 0.552 for ES2A-115 \xb0C, x c = 0.754 for ES1A-2880 min (140 \xb0C), and x c = 0.785 for ES1A2A-125 \xb0C. Combining the WAXD x c of 0.785 and DSC \u0394Hm (37.6 J/g) for the ECCs, the \u0394Hm of 100 % ECC (\u0394Hm\xb0) for PV(DF-TrFE) 80/20 was calculated to be 47.9 J/g. The dynamic force can be either a continuous sinusoidal wave or on\u2013off using a weight. The Berlincourt piezo d33 meter uses this quasi-static method without the need to measure the sinusoidal polarization output. Again, it is important to subtract triboelectric charges to calculate the neat piezoelectric d33. After electrospinning, PVDF-based fiber mats exhibit the ferroelectric phase with certain self-polarization because of the high DC voltage applied during electrospinning. The macroscopic Pr0 orients along the normal direction of the nonwoven nanofiber mat. As a result, the as-ES PVDF-based nanofiber mats often exhibit weak piezoelectricity with a piezoelectric open-circuit voltage (Voc) in the range of 0.2\u20131.5 V. In this study, the piezoelectric Voc at 0.055 MPa compression was 0.7 V, and the average d33 for the as-electrospun nanofiber mat was determined to be \u221275 pC/N (see ). To further enhance the piezoelectric performance, the above four fiber mats were poled with corona-poling in air at room temperature for 30 min. When these fiber mats were subjected to corona poling in air, it was noticed that the distance between the high-voltage probe and the fiber mat could not be shorter than 2 cm. After corona-poling in air, the apparent d33 was determined using direct piezoelectric measurement, as detailed before. To eliminate the effect of self-polarized Pr0 in the as-electrospun fiber mats of P(VDF-TrFE) 80/20, the samples were thermally annealed at 140 \xb0C (i.e., above the TC but below the Tm) for 60 min under a short-circuit condition. Then, triboelectricity was measured directly for the 140 \xb0C-annealed fiber mats, and triboelectric Voc and charge results are shown in. Here, it is better to avoid using Voc to calculate the apparent d33, because we need to estimate the dielectric constants of the fiber mat under different dynamic stresses, which is not a trivial task (i.e., it is not easy to determine which mixing rule is appropriate). Instead, it is straightforward to use the piezoelectric charge to calculate the apparent d33: d33 = (Q/A1)/(F/A2), where Q is the piezoelectric charge, A1 is the electrode area, and F is the applied force on an area A2. c shows the apparent d33 as a function of the dynamic stress for different nanofiber mats. Before the saturation around 25 kPa, the apparent d33 increased with increasing the dynamic stress. Intriguingly, the maximum d33 values were closely related to the ECC structure, crystallinity, and ferroelectric domain size (which is inferred from TC and \u0394HC, see the DSC discussion above). For the corona-poled ES sample (ESP) in air, the maximum \u2212d33 was only 181 \xb1 3 pC/N. This is attributed to its relatively lower crystallinity (50.8 %) and small ferroelectric domains (which is reflected by the low TC of 119.8 \xb0C and the low \u0394HC of 9.7 J/g). For the corona-poled ES1A-2800 min sample (ES1AP) in air, the maximum \u2212d33 increased to 233 \xb1 8 pC/N because of its higher crystallinity (75.4 %). However, the ferroelectric domain size was still small because of the high annealing temperature of 140 \xb0C above TC (130.6 \xb0C with \u0394HC = 34.9 J/g). For the corona-poled ES2A-115 \xb0C sample (ES2AP) in air, the maximum \u2212d33 increased to 357 \xb1 12C/N. This is attributed to the increased ferroelectric domain size (TC = 126.3 \xb0C and \u0394HC = 18.1 J/g). Finally, for the corona-poled ES1A2A-125 \xb0C sample (ES1A2AP) in air, the maximum \u2212d33 increased to 551 \xb1 13 pC/N. This is attributed to the thickest ECCs, high crystallinity of 78.5 %, and the largest ferroelectric domains (the highest TC of 139.6 \xb0C and \u0394HC of 40.05 J/g). Supposedly, the piezoelectric d33, which is a constant, should be obtained from the slope of the linear charge density-dynamic stress curve passing through the origin (see b). Only when the fiber mat was compressed to certain extent (i.e., dynamic stress above 0.025 MPa), the linear mechanical behavior and thus the linear charge density-dynamic stress curve were observed in b. Using this linear lines, the ultimate d33 (d33,u) values were obtained, as shown in b. As we can see, the apparent d33 is different from the ultimate d33,u. During poling in air, the corona-charging with such a long tip-to-sample distance (2 cm) may not be enough to align the P(VDF-TrFE) dipoles well. The dielectric constant of air is very low (\u03b5r \u223c 1) as compared with that of P(VDF-TrFE) (\u03b5r \u223c 10). Therefore, it is desired to have a liquid or a solid poling medium with a high dielectric constant to further enhance electric poling of dipoles and domains in P(VDF-TrFE) nanofibers. Pure water has a high permittivity of 78.5 at room temperature because of the presence of polar nano-regions , drastically higher than that (\u223c10) of P(VDF-TrFE) 80/20. In the wet nanofiber mat under electric poling, the local electric field inside the low dielectric constant P(VDF-TrFE) nanofibers would be higher than that in the high dielectric constant water medium. The higher local field inside the P(VDF-TrFE) nanofibers could help the poling of ferroelectric domains. Therefore, it can be a good candidate for the post corona poling of P(VDF-TrFE) fiber mats. For the corona-poling in water, we should not use contact-poling, because it is well-known that dipolar water molecules will form an electric double layer (EDL) when it is in direct contact with the metal electrodes. As such, the electric field will concentrate in the very thin EDL (e.g., ca. 2 nm) and cause significant electrolytic reaction at a low applied voltage (\u223c2 V due to the presence of overpotentials at both anode and cathode). Without the formation of any EDLs, the electric field in the water-wetted fiber mats can be high. Also, we should not use the conventional DC corona poling, which may still be able to degrade water into hydrogen and oxygen gasses to cause fire or explosion. Instead, we choose AC corona poling at 500 kHz to avoid the formation of ionic EDLs and potential electrolytic degradation of water (see the Experimental section in the ). Moreover, the overheating problem can be solved by effective water-cooling, and the distance between the probe and the water-wetted fiber mat can decrease to 0.5 cm without any electric discharge damage. By shortening this distance, the electric field in the wet nanofiber mat is increased, which can further benefit the electric poling of the ferroelectric domains in the P(VDF-TrFE) nanofibers. Due to the hydrophobic nature of P(VDF-TrFE), direct immersion of the fiber mats in water would cause many trapped air bubbles. After corona-poling in water followed by drying in vacuum, the direct piezoelectric measurement of d33 was performed. a,b show the piezoelectric Voc and c shows the piezoelectric charge after subtraction of the triboelectric charge. From the piezoelectric charge density vs. dynamic stress (the inset of d), the apparent d33 values were calculated (d). The apparent \u2212d33 increased to 1044 \xb1 20 pC/N when the dynamic stress was above 25 kPa. From the linear charge density-dynamic stress line, the ultimate d33,u was obtained as \u22121045 pC/N. The output Voc also increased to 29.9 \xb1 0.5 V (b). To the best of our knowledge, it is one of the highest Voc values achieved for polymer-based piezoelectric energy nano-generators (PENG). Note that the apparent piezoelectric d33 (\u22121044 pC/N) from the dimensional effect of fiber mats can be significantly larger than the intrinsic limiting d33 (ca. \u2212190 pC/N ) of solid PVDF or P(VDF-TrFE) samples, which are not really compressible. This is because the fiber mats can be compressed to significantly reduce the volume, thus increasing the apparent d33. The apparent d33 of \u22121044 pC/N for the corona-poled ES1A2A fiber mat in water is comparable to the d33 value of \u22121050 pC/N reported for a solid P(VDF-TrFE)-based tetrapolymer film under a DC bias.. Based on the above experimental observations, the mechanism of corona poling in water to increase the apparent d33 could be inferred. First, for corona poling in air, electric field lines will concentrate in air (\u03b5r = 1.0) and bypass the high dielectric constant (\u03b5r \u223c 10) nanofibers; therefore, the local field in P(VDF-TrFE) nanofibers is very low. Meanwhile, the dielectric constant (\u03b5r = 78.4) of water is much higher than that of the nanofibers; therefore, the local electric field inside the nanofibers should be higher than the average electric field. In this study, we determined the macroscopic Pr0 for the corona-poled ES1A2AP fiber mats in air and water (Pr0,fm). Considering the porosity of the fiber mat, the Pr0 of the corona-poled P(VDF-TrFE) 80/20 fibers in air and water (Pr0,f) can be also determined. In this work, we used an aluminum (Al) rod (130 g) to hold the fiber mat in place, and additional weights (10\u2013500 g) were added on the Al rod to vary the dynamic stress. Both the Al rod and weight were lifted and lowered repeatedly to determine the apparent piezoelectric d33. The dimensional effect, i.e., polarization change (\u0394Pn) due to the volume change during the direct piezoelectric measurement, can be quantified as: where Pn is the polarization under a dynamic stress (Tn), and n refers to the experimental run number. For each sample, six weights of 10\u2013500 g were used together with the Al rod, corresponding to six different stresses Tn. Vn is the volume under the specific Tn: Vn = Atn, where A is the sample area under compression (1.04 cmE^{2}), and tn is the fiber mat thickness. The original volume V0 was determined from the original thickness t0 (\u223c 140 \u03bcm) of the free-standing fiber mat, V0 = At0. In addition, we also measured the thickness changes (\u0394tn) of the fiber mat using the MTI 2100 photonic sensor, when different weights were put on the Al rod. Finally, we obtain the following equation: where \u0394Qn is the piezoelectric charge generated by the dynamic stress Tn (see d). Using nonlinear fitting with Eqn. , we determined the macroscopic dipole moment M values, 2.5 \xb1 0.5 \xd7 10E^{-14} and 4.1 \xb1 0.4 \xd7 10E^{-14} Cm for corona-poled fiber mats in air and water, respectively. Using the area of 1.04 cmE^{2} and the original fiber mat thickness of 140 \u03bcm, the Pr0,fm values of the corona-poled fiber mats air and water were 1.7 \xb1 0.3 and 2.8 \xb1 0.3 \u03bcC/mE^{2}. Detailed nonlinear fitting is described in Section 7 in the. By measuring the weight of the fiber mat with an area of 1.40 \xd7 1.40 cmE^{2}, the fiber mat porosity (p) was calculated to be: p = 0.78. Based on the values of M, V0, and p, the Pr0,f values of the corona-poled fiber mats in air and water were determined as 7.5 \xb1 1.5 and 12.3 \xb1 1.2 \u03bcC/mE^{2}, respectively. For fully poled P(VDF-TrFE) 80/20 with uniform crystal orientation and 100 % crystallinity, the theoretical Pr0 should be 150 mC/mE^{2}. Assuming a more or less random orientation of the P(VDF-TrFE) nanofibers in the fiber mat and a crystallinity of 75 %, the Pr0 of the fiber should be 1/3 \xd7 0.75 of the theoretical value: 37.5 mC/mE^{2}. The Pr0,f value of 12.7 \u03bcC/mE^{2} for the corona-poled nanofibers in water was significantly lower, suggesting that there should still be much room for further improvement of the piezoelectric performance for the P(VDF-TrFE) 80/20 fiber mats. If a better poling method can be found to further increase Pr0,f, we could achieve even higher d33. Comparing PENGs with the triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), we see that charges comes from the polarization change of the material rather than surface potential. That is, the stability of the PENGs is much better than that of TENGs. Here, we give an example to verify the thermostability of these fiber mat PENGs in. After corona-poling in water, the ES1A2A sample was annealed at different temperatures for 30 min. As shown in a and b, after 30 min thermal annealing, piezoelectricity started to decrease around 100 \xb0C. Above 115 \xb0C, as the TC2 (125 \xb0C) was approached, the piezoelectricity sharply decreased. When the annealing temperature was above 140 \xb0C (i.e., the TC1), the piezoelectric effect completely disappeared. c compares the Voc and maximum usage temperature among different piezoelectric polymers, composites, and BaTiO3. The comprehensive performance of the corona-poled fiber mat in water is summarized in c and 6d, with a comparison with other piezoelectric materials (both fiber mats and solid films) reported in the past. c shows Voc and the thermal stability among different PENGs, and d compares the piezoelectric coefficient |d33| among various piezoelectric materials. From both figures, our corona-poled P(VDF-TrFE) fiber mat in water showed outstanding performance over most other materials.

Using electrospinning equipped with a grounded rolling collector, nonwoven ES fiber mats of P(VDF-TrFE) 80/20 were prepared from 12 wt% methyl ether ketone (MEK) solution (see in the ). Afterwards, multi-step thermal annealing processes were used to achieve ECCs with thickened ferroelectric domains. Finally, corona-charging was employed to achieve the permanent remanent polarization (Pr0) for piezoelectricity. In the first thermal annealing (1A) process, the ES fiber mat was held isothermally at 140 \xb0C to produce ECCs via chain-sliding motions in the paraelectric phase, as previously reported. Before thermal annealing, the as-spun fiber mat exhibited the melting of secondary (Tm,SC, heat of fusion \u0394Hm,SC = 1.89 J/g) and primary crystals (Tm,PC) at 51.5 and 147.5 \xb0C, respectively. The Curie temperature (TC) was observed to be 119.8 \xb0C, followed by a small exothermic peak at 125.1 \xb0C. This peak could be attributed to the cold crystallization (Tcx, i.e., crystallization upon heating) from the defect structure frozen during the fast electrospinning process, and it was also reported in a uniaxially oriented P(VDF-TrFE) 75/25 film in a previous publication. The TC and Tm of the as-spun fiber mat were apparently lower than those of the melt-crystallized sample after removing the memory of thermal history by the first melting (see b later), indicative of defective ferroelectric domains and folded-chain crystals (FCCs) formed during electrospinning. At 140 \xb0C, a series of isothermal annealing times were chosen: 10, 60, 180, 360, 720, 1440, and 2880 min, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to monitor the effect of thermal annealing time on TC/heat of Curie transition (\u0394HC) and Tm/heat of melting (\u0394Hm); see b and 1c. After 10-min of 1A, dramatic changes took place. First, the Tm,SC and Tcx peaks vanished. As we have discussed before , annealing above Tm,SC could melt secondary crystals and recrystallize them onto the prime crystals for P(VDF-TrFE) 80/20, and thus eliminate the Tcx peak. Second, improvement of crystalline grains and ferroelectric domains happened simultaneously, and this is reflected by the increase of Tm and TC/\u0394HC. Upon further 1A annealing, Tm increased to 152.8 \xb0C, and \u0394Hm increased to 37.6 J/g at 2880 min. However, the situations for TC and \u0394HC were different. Finally, after 2880-min isothermal annealing at 140 \xb0C, we obtained an ECC structure for P(VDF-TrFE) 80/20 with an extremely high crystallinity (x c) of almost 80 % (\u0394Hm = 37.6 J/g, see the powder X-ray data later) and a high Tm of 152.9 \xb0C. The ECC structure was proved by the small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) result in d. The overall lamellar thickness (L), which included both crystalline and amorphous layers, increased significantly from 10.6 nm for the non-annealed P(VDF-TrFE) 80/20 to 80.0 nm for the 140 \xb0C-annealed sample. During this process, the TC decreased to 130.6 \xb0C, \u0394HC was 34.9 J/g, and the Curie peak broadened. The decrease in overall Curie transition temperature is due to the thermal annealing higher than TC. All the samples exhibited the all-trans conformation with peaks at 504, 842, and 1284 cmE^{\u22121}. Their relationship obeys the Gibbs-Thomson equation: Tm = Tm\xb0(1-K/Lc) , where Tm\xb0 is the equilibrium melting temperature and K is a constant related to the folded-chain surface energy and \u0394Hm of 100 % ECC. However, it seems that P(VDF-TrFE) 80/20 did not fit well here. As the lamellar thickness L increased about 7.5 times from FCCs to ECCs (see d), the Tm only increased 5.4 \xb0C. We consider that, as the crystalline lamellae thickened, defective segments with more TrFE units were included in the crystalline region, which could decrease both Tm and \u0394Hm. Although Lc significantly increased for P(VDF-TrFE) 80/20 upon 1A above the TC, the experimental Tm only increased slightly. The second annealing (2A) was carried out for ES1A-2880 min below TC with a fixed isothermal time of 1 day to further increase the ferroelectric domain size. Different from PVDF homopolymers, it is proposed that ferroelectric domains in P(VDF-TrFE) could increase their size upon thermal annealing slightly below TC by enhanced chain-sliding and rotational motions to remove defective domain walls. In this study, the 2A temperatures were chosen as 110, 115, 125, and 130 \xb0C. As seen in a, two TC peaks appeared after the second annealing. For example, for the DSC curve of ES1A2A-110 \xb0C, the main TC (TC1) peak was 130.3 \xb0C and the minor TC (TC2) was 114.8 \xb0C. The TC2 should originate from the \u201cmelting\u201d of poor ferroelectric domains at the 2A temperature. When the 2A temperature increased, the primary ferroelectric domains enlarged in size, increasing both TC1 and \u0394HC1 (b). Meanwhile, more \u201cpoor\u201d ferroelectric domains \u201cmelted\u201d, leading to a higher \u0394HC2. The TC1 reached its maximum value of 139.6 \xb0C upon 2A at 125 \xb0C (b). To quantify the heats of transitions for TC1, TC2, and Tm, PeakfitE^{TM} software was used to calculate \u0394HC,total, \u0394HC2, and \u0394Hm (c). It is noteworthy that after 2A at 125 \xb0C, the total \u0394HC,total increased to \u0394HC,total = \u0394HC1 + \u0394HC2 = 8.27 + 31.77 J/g = 40.04 J/g. The TC1 peak height was comparable to the Tm peak height of the paraelectric crystals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest \u0394HC value ever achieved for P(VDF-TrFE) random copolymers, suggesting the largest ferroelectric domains achieved by the 2-step thermal annealing, as proposed by Ohigashi and coworkers. In the case of Tm, intriguingly only a slight increase (from 152.8 to 153.3 \xb0C) was seen after 2A at 125 \xb0C. This indicated that the ECC paraelectric crystals were not much affected by the 2A step. Finally, after 2A at 130 \xb0C for ES1A2A-130 \xb0C, both TC1 and \u0394HC1 started to decrease, and \u0394HC2 significantly increased (a-c). This is because the 2A temperature was so high that most ferroelectric domains \u201cmelted\u201d. A single-step 2A (i.e., without 1A) was also performed, as shown in a, to compare with the two-step 2A annealing. The highest annealing temperature could only reach 115 \xb0C, and the highest TC achieved 126.3 \xb0C with a low \u0394HC of 18.1 J/g. After that, a similar \u201cmelting\u201d issue of ferroelectric domains was observed. Moreover, the cold crystallization Tcx was still observable, and the Tm was only 148.1 \xb0C. These results showed the importance of the 1A step for the 2A to achieve ECCs with large ferroelectric domains in the electrospun fiber mats of P(VDF-TrFE) 80/20. Tensile mechanical properties of various P(VDF-TrFE) 80/20 fiber mats are presented in d. For the ES and ES2A-115 \xb0C fiber mats with FCCs, the Young\u2019s modulus (Y) values were around 4.5 MPa, and the strains at break were around 45 %. For the ES1A-2880 min fiber mat, ECCs were obtained, and the YES1A increased to 11.2 MPa with a decreased strain at break of 18 %. Finally, for the ES1A2A-125 \xb0C fiber mat with ECCs and the highest crystallinity, the YES1A2A increased to 70 MPa while the strain at break further decreased to 13 %. The increased Young\u2019s modulus and decreased strain at break after extensive thermal annealing should be attributed to the increase crystallinity in the fiber mats. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) was employed to characterize the crystal orientation and crystallinity increase upon thermal annealing. a-d show the 2D WAXD fiber patterns of aligned ES, ES2A-115 \xb0C, ES1A-2880 min, and ES1A2A-125 \xb0C nanofibers, respectively, with the fibers along the vertical direction. The (110/200) reflections of the ferroelectric phase were on the equator, and the (001) reflection was on the meridian. The 2D powder WAXD patterns of different fiber mats are presented in. From the integrated 1D powder WAXD curves in e, the crystallinity x c was quantitively determined using the crystalline-amorphous two-phase model: x c = 0.508 for ES, x c = 0.552 for ES2A-115 \xb0C, x c = 0.754 for ES1A-2880 min (140 \xb0C), and x c = 0.785 for ES1A2A-125 \xb0C. Combining the WAXD x c of 0.785 and DSC \u0394Hm (37.6 J/g) for the ECCs, the \u0394Hm of 100 % ECC (\u0394Hm\xb0) for PV(DF-TrFE) 80/20 was calculated to be 47.9 J/g. The dynamic force can be either a continuous sinusoidal wave or on\u2013off using a weight. The Berlincourt piezo d33 meter uses this quasi-static method without the need to measure the sinusoidal polarization output. Again, it is important to subtract triboelectric charges to calculate the neat piezoelectric d33. After electrospinning, PVDF-based fiber mats exhibit the ferroelectric phase with certain self-polarization because of the high DC voltage applied during electrospinning. The macroscopic Pr0 orients along the normal direction of the nonwoven nanofiber mat. As a result, the as-ES PVDF-based nanofiber mats often exhibit weak piezoelectricity with a piezoelectric open-circuit voltage (Voc) in the range of 0.2\u20131.5 V. In this study, the piezoelectric Voc at 0.055 MPa compression was 0.7 V, and the average d33 for the as-electrospun nanofiber mat was determined to be \u221275 pC/N (see ). To further enhance the piezoelectric performance, the above four fiber mats were poled with corona-poling in air at room temperature for 30 min. When these fiber mats were subjected to corona poling in air, it was noticed that the distance between the high-voltage probe and the fiber mat could not be shorter than 2 cm. After corona-poling in air, the apparent d33 was determined using direct piezoelectric measurement, as detailed before. To eliminate the effect of self-polarized Pr0 in the as-electrospun fiber mats of P(VDF-TrFE) 80/20, the samples were thermally annealed at 140 \xb0C (i.e., above the TC but below the Tm) for 60 min under a short-circuit condition. Then, triboelectricity was measured directly for the 140 \xb0C-annealed fiber mats, and triboelectric Voc and charge results are shown in. Here, it is better to avoid using Voc to calculate the apparent d33, because we need to estimate the dielectric constants of the fiber mat under different dynamic stresses, which is not a trivial task (i.e., it is not easy to determine which mixing rule is appropriate). Instead, it is straightforward to use the piezoelectric charge to calculate the apparent d33: d33 = (Q/A1)/(F/A2), where Q is the piezoelectric charge, A1 is the electrode area, and F is the applied force on an area A2. c shows the apparent d33 as a function of the dynamic stress for different nanofiber mats. Before the saturation around 25 kPa, the apparent d33 increased with increasing the dynamic stress. Intriguingly, the maximum d33 values were closely related to the ECC structure, crystallinity, and ferroelectric domain size (which is inferred from TC and \u0394HC, see the DSC discussion above). For the corona-poled ES sample (ESP) in air, the maximum \u2212d33 was only 181 \xb1 3 pC/N. This is attributed to its relatively lower crystallinity (50.8 %) and small ferroelectric domains (which is reflected by the low TC of 119.8 \xb0C and the low \u0394HC of 9.7 J/g). For the corona-poled ES1A-2800 min sample (ES1AP) in air, the maximum \u2212d33 increased to 233 \xb1 8 pC/N because of its higher crystallinity (75.4 %). However, the ferroelectric domain size was still small because of the high annealing temperature of 140 \xb0C above TC (130.6 \xb0C with \u0394HC = 34.9 J/g). For the corona-poled ES2A-115 \xb0C sample (ES2AP) in air, the maximum \u2212d33 increased to 357 \xb1 12C/N. This is attributed to the increased ferroelectric domain size (TC = 126.3 \xb0C and \u0394HC = 18.1 J/g). Finally, for the corona-poled ES1A2A-125 \xb0C sample (ES1A2AP) in air, the maximum \u2212d33 increased to 551 \xb1 13 pC/N. This is attributed to the thickest ECCs, high crystallinity of 78.5 %, and the largest ferroelectric domains (the highest TC of 139.6 \xb0C and \u0394HC of 40.05 J/g). Supposedly, the piezoelectric d33, which is a constant, should be obtained from the slope of the linear charge density-dynamic stress curve passing through the origin (see b). Only when the fiber mat was compressed to certain extent (i.e., dynamic stress above 0.025 MPa), the linear mechanical behavior and thus the linear charge density-dynamic stress curve were observed in b. Using this linear lines, the ultimate d33 (d33,u) values were obtained, as shown in b. As we can see, the apparent d33 is different from the ultimate d33,u. During poling in air, the corona-charging with such a long tip-to-sample distance (2 cm) may not be enough to align the P(VDF-TrFE) dipoles well. The dielectric constant of air is very low (\u03b5r \u223c 1) as compared with that of P(VDF-TrFE) (\u03b5r \u223c 10). Therefore, it is desired to have a liquid or a solid poling medium with a high dielectric constant to further enhance electric poling of dipoles and domains in P(VDF-TrFE) nanofibers. Pure water has a high permittivity of 78.5 at room temperature because of the presence of polar nano-regions , drastically higher than that (\u223c10) of P(VDF-TrFE) 80/20. In the wet nanofiber mat under electric poling, the local electric field inside the low dielectric constant P(VDF-TrFE) nanofibers would be higher than that in the high dielectric constant water medium. The higher local field inside the P(VDF-TrFE) nanofibers could help the poling of ferroelectric domains. Therefore, it can be a good candidate for the post corona poling of P(VDF-TrFE) fiber mats. For the corona-poling in water, we should not use contact-poling, because it is well-known that dipolar water molecules will form an electric double layer (EDL) when it is in direct contact with the metal electrodes. As such, the electric field will concentrate in the very thin EDL (e.g., ca. 2 nm) and cause significant electrolytic reaction at a low applied voltage (\u223c2 V due to the presence of overpotentials at both anode and cathode). Without the formation of any EDLs, the electric field in the water-wetted fiber mats can be high. Also, we should not use the conventional DC corona poling, which may still be able to degrade water into hydrogen and oxygen gasses to cause fire or explosion. Instead, we choose AC corona poling at 500 kHz to avoid the formation of ionic EDLs and potential electrolytic degradation of water (see the Experimental section in the ). Moreover, the overheating problem can be solved by effective water-cooling, and the distance between the probe and the water-wetted fiber mat can decrease to 0.5 cm without any electric discharge damage. By shortening this distance, the electric field in the wet nanofiber mat is increased, which can further benefit the electric poling of the ferroelectric domains in the P(VDF-TrFE) nanofibers. Due to the hydrophobic nature of P(VDF-TrFE), direct immersion of the fiber mats in water would cause many trapped air bubbles. After corona-poling in water followed by drying in vacuum, the direct piezoelectric measurement of d33 was performed. a,b show the piezoelectric Voc and c shows the piezoelectric charge after subtraction of the triboelectric charge. From the piezoelectric charge density vs. dynamic stress (the inset of d), the apparent d33 values were calculated (d). The apparent \u2212d33 increased to 1044 \xb1 20 pC/N when the dynamic stress was above 25 kPa. From the linear charge density-dynamic stress line, the ultimate d33,u was obtained as \u22121045 pC/N. The output Voc also increased to 29.9 \xb1 0.5 V (b). To the best of our knowledge, it is one of the highest Voc values achieved for polymer-based piezoelectric energy nano-generators (PENG). Note that the apparent piezoelectric d33 (\u22121044 pC/N) from the dimensional effect of fiber mats can be significantly larger than the intrinsic limiting d33 (ca. \u2212190 pC/N ) of solid PVDF or P(VDF-TrFE) samples, which are not really compressible. This is because the fiber mats can be compressed to significantly reduce the volume, thus increasing the apparent d33. The apparent d33 of \u22121044 pC/N for the corona-poled ES1A2A fiber mat in water is comparable to the d33 value of \u22121050 pC/N reported for a solid P(VDF-TrFE)-based tetrapolymer film under a DC bias.. Based on the above experimental observations, the mechanism of corona poling in water to increase the apparent d33 could be inferred. First, for corona poling in air, electric field lines will concentrate in air (\u03b5r = 1.0) and bypass the high dielectric constant (\u03b5r \u223c 10) nanofibers; therefore, the local field in P(VDF-TrFE) nanofibers is very low. Meanwhile, the dielectric constant (\u03b5r = 78.4) of water is much higher than that of the nanofibers; therefore, the local electric field inside the nanofibers should be higher than the average electric field. In this study, we determined the macroscopic Pr0 for the corona-poled ES1A2AP fiber mats in air and water (Pr0,fm). Considering the porosity of the fiber mat, the Pr0 of the corona-poled P(VDF-TrFE) 80/20 fibers in air and water (Pr0,f) can be also determined. In this work, we used an aluminum (Al) rod (130 g) to hold the fiber mat in place, and additional weights (10\u2013500 g) were added on the Al rod to vary the dynamic stress. Both the Al rod and weight were lifted and lowered repeatedly to determine the apparent piezoelectric d33. The dimensional effect, i.e., polarization change (\u0394Pn) due to the volume change during the direct piezoelectric measurement, can be quantified as: where Pn is the polarization under a dynamic stress (Tn), and n refers to the experimental run number. For each sample, six weights of 10\u2013500 g were used together with the Al rod, corresponding to six different stresses Tn. Vn is the volume under the specific Tn: Vn = Atn, where A is the sample area under compression (1.04 cmE^{2}), and tn is the fiber mat thickness. The original volume V0 was determined from the original thickness t0 (\u223c 140 \u03bcm) of the free-standing fiber mat, V0 = At0. In addition, we also measured the thickness changes (\u0394tn) of the fiber mat using the MTI 2100 photonic sensor, when different weights were put on the Al rod. Finally, we obtain the following equation: where \u0394Qn is the piezoelectric charge generated by the dynamic stress Tn (see d). Using nonlinear fitting with Eqn. , we determined the macroscopic dipole moment M values, 2.5 \xb1 0.5 \xd7 10E^{-14} and 4.1 \xb1 0.4 \xd7 10E^{-14} Cm for corona-poled fiber mats in air and water, respectively. Using the area of 1.04 cmE^{2} and the original fiber mat thickness of 140 \u03bcm, the Pr0,fm values of the corona-poled fiber mats air and water were 1.7 \xb1 0.3 and 2.8 \xb1 0.3 \u03bcC/mE^{2}. Detailed nonlinear fitting is described in Section 7 in the. By measuring the weight of the fiber mat with an area of 1.40 \xd7 1.40 cmE^{2}, the fiber mat porosity (p) was calculated to be: p = 0.78. Based on the values of M, V0, and p, the Pr0,f values of the corona-poled fiber mats in air and water were determined as 7.5 \xb1 1.5 and 12.3 \xb1 1.2 \u03bcC/mE^{2}, respectively. For fully poled P(VDF-TrFE) 80/20 with uniform crystal orientation and 100 % crystallinity, the theoretical Pr0 should be 150 mC/mE^{2}. Assuming a more or less random orientation of the P(VDF-TrFE) nanofibers in the fiber mat and a crystallinity of 75 %, the Pr0 of the fiber should be 1/3 \xd7 0.75 of the theoretical value: 37.5 mC/mE^{2}. The Pr0,f value of 12.7 \u03bcC/mE^{2} for the corona-poled nanofibers in water was significantly lower, suggesting that there should still be much room for further improvement of the piezoelectric performance for the P(VDF-TrFE) 80/20 fiber mats. If a better poling method can be found to further increase Pr0,f, we could achieve even higher d33. Comparing PENGs with the triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), we see that charges comes from the polarization change of the material rather than surface potential. That is, the stability of the PENGs is much better than that of TENGs. Here, we give an example to verify the thermostability of these fiber mat PENGs in. After corona-poling in water, the ES1A2A sample was annealed at different temperatures for 30 min. As shown in a and b, after 30 min thermal annealing, piezoelectricity started to decrease around 100 \xb0C. Above 115 \xb0C, as the TC2 (125 \xb0C) was approached, the piezoelectricity sharply decreased. When the annealing temperature was above 140 \xb0C (i.e., the TC1), the piezoelectric effect completely disappeared. c compares the Voc and maximum usage temperature among different piezoelectric polymers, composites, and BaTiO3. The comprehensive performance of the corona-poled fiber mat in water is summarized in c and 6d, with a comparison with other piezoelectric materials (both fiber mats and solid films) reported in the past. c shows Voc and the thermal stability among different PENGs, and d compares the piezoelectric coefficient |d33| among various piezoelectric materials. From both figures, our corona-poled P(VDF-TrFE) fiber mat in water showed outstanding performance over most other materials.
