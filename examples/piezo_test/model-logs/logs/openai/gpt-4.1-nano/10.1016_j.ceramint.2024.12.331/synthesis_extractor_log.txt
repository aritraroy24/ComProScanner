0.995(K0.48Na0.52)1-x Li x NbO3-0.005BiAlO3 (x = 0, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05) (KNLN-BAO) ceramic powders were synthesized by solid state reaction method using Bi2O3 (99 %, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.), Na2CO3 (99.8 %, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.), K2CO3 (99 %, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.), Li2CO3 (99.5 %, Macklin Co Ltd.), Al2O3 (99.99 %, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) and Nb2O5 (99.5 %, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) as raw materials. Firstly, all powders were weighed according to the designed chemical formula and ground for 6h in ethanol. The suspensions were dried, calcined at 850 \xb0C for 3h and repeated procedures of grinding, drying, and calcining for the homogenization of powders. The calcined powders were mixed with 2 wt% binder (5 wt% PVA solution), pressed into pellets with a diameter of 12 mm and a thickness of 1 mm under a pressure of 100Mpa. The pellets were burned out at 600 \xb0C for 2h and sintered at 1140 \xb0C in sealed crucibles for 2h for KNLN-BAO ceramics with relative density over 95 % of the theoretical density according to measurements by Archimedes method. The phase structure was detected by an X-ray diffractometer (X\u2019 Pert PRO, XRD, Dutch) with Cu K\u03b1 radiation of wavelength 1.5405 \xc5 and further confirmed by Raman spectroscopy (RamanRxn2, Kaiser, America) from 100 cmE^{\u22121} to 1000 cmE^{\u22121} at room temperature. Cross-section morphology was observed by a scanning electron microscope (ZEM15, Zeptools, SEM). To characterize the electric properties of ceramics, the surfaces were coated with silver paste and annealed at 600 \xb0C for 10 min. The dielectric properties dependence of temperature in the range of \u221255\xb0C- 480 \xb0C and frequency (100Hz, 1 kHz, 100 kHz and 1 MHz) for samples with heat rate of 2 \xb0C/min were measured using precision LCR meter (E4294A, Agilent, USA) and lower temperature chamber(EC1A, PolyK, USA) for test from \u221255 \xb0C to 200 \xb0C with 2 \xb0C/min and high temperature chamber (DMS-1000, Partulab, China) for measurement from 25 \xb0C to 480 \xb0C.The hysteresis loops of the ceramics were measured at room temperature using a ferroelectric material test system (PolyK, USA) in a silicon oil bath, using triangular voltage waveforms at a frequency of 10Hz with high voltage supplier (610C, Trek, USA). The d 33 of ceramics were tested at room temperature with piezo-d 33 m (ZJ-3A, China). The ceramics were poled for 15min under the 5 kV/mm at 40 \xb0C and then circuit-shorted for 24h typically before pyroelectric current test and d 33 measurement. The pyroelectric current was measured via the TSC testing module of a broadband dielectric spectrometer (Concept 80, Novocontrol, Germany) based on the Byer-Roundy method  with the heating rate of 2 \xb0C/min from 10 \xb0C to 200 \xb0C recorded by pA meter (B2985A, Agilent, USA). The TSDC analysis was conducted by the TSDC module of Concept80 system for the ceramic with different poling voltages (0.4 kV/mm, 0.6 kV/mm, 0.8 kV/mm and 1 kV/mm) at 80 \xb0C for 15min and circuit-shorted for 10min, recording current from \u221220 \xb0C to 200 \xb0C during processes with heating rate 3 \xb0C/min and cooling rate 10 \xb0C/min separately.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
To investigate the effect of lithium doping on the phase structure of the ceramics, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was obtained, as shown in (a). All peaks were well matched with the PDF card of ICSD 173741 (T phase) and ICSD 380427 (O phase). The relative intensity ratio of peaks (002) and (200) are utilized to quantify the phase structures in KNN ceramics. The relative intensity ratio (I 002/I 200) is approximately 2:1 in orthorhombic phase (O phase, Amm2), while it changes to be around 1:2 for the tetragonal phase (T phase, P4mm). To further present the phase transition with different lithium doping in KNN-BAO ceramics, the enlarged XRD patterns in the range of 22\xb0\u201324\xb0 and 44\xb0\u201347\xb0 are displayed separately in (b and c). The intensity ratio of (I 002/I 200) decreased with addition of lithium dopant in the ceramics. The ratio (I 002/I 200) of samples with x \u2264 0.03 were around 1:2 indicating the orthorhombic phase, while it became about 2:1 for the specimens with 0.04 \u2264 x \u2264 0.06 implying that the coexistence of O phase and T phase, which was consistent with the reported results. To further determine each fraction of O phase and T phase in ceramics with different amounts of lithium doping, Rietveld refinements via GSAS EXPGUI software were utilized for analysis in with R wp < 10 % indicating the reliable results. Various phase structures were tried to best fit the pattern with the database of CIF for O phase (Amm2, Z = 2, COD 7212939) and T phase (P4mm, Z = 1, COD 2104294). The fraction of T phase (P4mm) increases up to 41 % in x = 0.05, while that of the O phase decreases to 51.8 % in x = 0.06 as shown in (f). The c/a ratio for the separate T phase increased with addition of lithium oxide in the ceramics of x = 0.04\u20130.06. The c/a ratio for T phase in the ceramic of x = 0.05 rose up to 1.02, which was in coherence with the reported lithium modified KNN ceramic (c/a 1.024). To further confirm the results from above XRD analysis, Raman spectra characterization for all samples were performed in the range of 100 cmE^{\u22121}-1000 cmE^{\u22121} at room temperature. Vibration modes of NbO6 octahedral were shown in , \u03bd 1 mode was strongly correlated with a symmetric stretching of NbO6 , which implied the structure evolution for phase transitions in KNN based ceramics. No clear variations of Raman shift were observed in the sample of x = 0.03, which meant the less effect on the O phase caused by small amount of li content. With the increase of Li content (x = 0.05, 0.06), the wave numbers of \u03bd 1 peak gradually shifted to a higher frequency, which reflected that the replacement of Li content on A-site caused the oxygen octahedral compression to the center forming T phase. Yang reported  that the enhancement of the hybridization between O 2p and Nb 4d orbitals was observed in Lithium doping KNN based ceramics, which reduced Nb-O bond length and enhanced distortion of Nb-O octahedron along the [001] direction. As shown in the SEM micrographs were obtained on the cross-section of ceramics sintered at 1140 \xb0C for 2h, which had been thermal etched at 1080 \xb0C for 30min before the characterization. For all samples, most of the grains seemed to be rectangular shape, while some grains were irregular. (a) shows the sample with x = 0 consists of small grain (\u223c3 \u03bcm) and large grains (over 10 \u03bcm) with average diameter of \u223c5.39 \u03bcm. When x \u2265 0.05, the grain distribution seemed to be more homogeneous and more round in shape, which indicated that the Li doping improved the growth of grains via formation of liquid phase lowering the surface energy during sintering process. At the same time, the elements distribution of the specimen with x = 0.05 were investigated via EDX analysis. More sections had been selected to confirm the homogeneous element distribution in KNLN-BAO ceramics. To further analyze the phase structure evolution, the dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) and dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) as a function of temperature had been performed for unpoled ceramics with different Li doping contents. As shown in , in the temperature range from \u221255 \xb0C to 480 \xb0C, all samples (0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.06) own two dielectric anomalies, which indicate the coexistence of O phase and T phase at lower temperature (T O-T) and the tetragonal phase-cubic phase at higher temperature (T C). shows that the T O-T decreases dramatically with the increase of Li doping content, while the T C gradually increases in proportion to the addition of Li doping, up to 447 \xb0C for x = 0.06. It clearly shows that the T O-T of x = 0.05 and x = 0.06 shift to the room temperature in. In addition, the P-E hysteresis loops of KNLN-BAO ceramics are displayed in (a), which were characterized at 25 \xb0C with the frequency of 10Hz. The P-E loops for x = 0, 0.03 and 0.04 ceramics were saturated, while it became a slight round shape for x = 0.05 and 0.06, which was mainly due to the existence of leakage current when Li doping content increased. As shown in (b), the remnant polarization (P r) decreases with the increase addition of Li dopant content, meanwhile the coercive field (E c) increases up to the peak for x = 0.05. However, the d 33 increases with the addition of Li doping up to the maximum for x = 0.05, as shown in (c). The enhancement of d 33 in the ceramic with higher permittivity was possibly due to the coexistence of O phase and T phase, where the polarization rotation was expected to be easier due to more polar vectors in ceramic with coexistence of O phase and T phase than that of single phase. As shown in , the pyroelectric property of different lithium doping contents were characterized after the poled samples circuit-shorted for over 24 h typically at room temperature. In (b), it depicts the calculated pyroelectric coefficient from 10 \xb0C to 200 \xb0C and amplified spectroscopy in the range of 10\xb0C\u201350 \xb0C, in which the pyroelectric peaks are strongly correlated with phase transition in ceramics with the anomalous variations of intrinsic spontaneous polarization. The calculated pyroelectric coefficient of x = 0.05 achieved around 3.6 \xd7 10E^{\u22124} C mE^{\u22122} KE^{\u22121} in (c), which was the highest value among the studied gradients. The result should be probably due to the coexistence of O phase and T phase at room temperature facilitating the abrupt variation of polarization with the change of temperature around T d and sufficient poling condition for x = 0.05, which was also demonstrated by the d 33 results. To further confirm the intrinsic pyroelectric contribution of pyroelectric current, second round of heating was performed after first cycle of heating and cooling in the range of 10\xb0C\u201340 \xb0C. The calculated pyroelectric coefficient of x = 0.05 during second heating cycle was 3.11 \xd7 10E^{\u22124} C mE^{\u22122} KE^{\u22121}). As shown in (c), the volume specific heat capacity (C v) of x = 0.05 from 0 \xb0C to 180 \xb0C rises with the increase of temperature. Generally, it should be emphasized that the figure of merits (FOMs) was utilized to assess the pyroelectric performance of materials for the application of infrared detector. FOMs are involved with the current detectivity (F i = p/C v) , voltage detectivity (F v = p/C v \u03b5 r \u03b5 0) and detectivity (F d = p/C v (\u03b5 r \u03b5 0tan\u03b4)E^{1/2}) , where p denotes pyroelectric coefficient, C v indicates the volume specific heat capacity, \u03b5 r indicates the relative dielectric constant, \u03b5 0 denotes the vacuum permittivity, tan\u03b4 indicates dielectric loss. The FOMs (F i, F v and F d) were calculated in the temperature range from 10 \xb0C to 35 \xb0C as shown in (d). As shown in , the pyroelectric performance and FOMs in this study are compared with other reported results. The composition of x = 0.05 for the ceramics presented moderate pyroelectric coefficient p (\u223c3.11 \xd7 10E^{\u22124} C mE^{\u22122} KE^{\u22121}) and F i (\u223c1.460 \xd7 10E^{\u221210} m VE^{\u22121}), but with better F v (\u223c0.0169 mE^{2} CE^{\u22121}) and F d (\u223c0.93 \xd7 10E^{\u22125} PaE^{\u22121/2}) compared with the counterparts, implying potential application of PIRD. TSDC analysis of ferroelectrics are known to be complicated for the pyroelectric effects resulting from the ferroelectric polarization changing with thermal fluctuation. Thus the possible TSDC signals from pyroelectric effect need to be analyzed at first. P-E loops were performed under 1 kV/mm of the ceramic x = 0.05 with the temperature changing from 25 \xb0C to 100 \xb0C as shown in (a). In (b) the P max and P r show less variation with thermal fluctuation indicating that nearly neglected ferroelectric polarization contribution for the TSDC signals. Meanwhile, the piezoelectric response under the condition of TSDC (1 kV/mm, 80 \xb0C, poling for 15min) for the ceramic was tested by d 33 m. No obvious signal of d 33 was detected at room temperature, which meant nearly no contribution of ferroelectric polarization caused by the electric field of 1 kV/mm due to higher coercive field of the ceramic. To further explore the extrinsic contribution of pyroelectric performance at lower temperature, TSDC analysis for the ceramic of x = 0.05 was investigated with different poling voltages from 0.4 kV/mm to 1 kV/mm. As displayed in , two TSDC current of Peak 1 and Peak 2 from \u221220 \xb0C to 200 \xb0C are presented in the pyroelectric current spectra for x = 0.05. With the increase of poling voltage, the peak position of Peak 1 shifted to high temperature, while the position of Peak 2 had no obvious change, suggesting that the Peak 1 should be related to the space charge at the lower temperature. As its widely known that in KNN based ceramics sintering in air, VO \u2022\u2022 is often induced as mobile ions due to the easy volatilization of alkalis metals during sintering process. The non-shifting of Peak 2 in the TSDC spectra indicated possible defect dipole in the ceramics of KNLN-BAO, which was possibly due to the preferable substitution of AlE^{3+} (CN = 6, 0.535 \xc5) for NbE^{5+} (CN = 6, 0.64 \xc5) in the B site. According to the principles of crystal chemistry, it's generally believed that BiE^{3+} (CN = 12, 1.36 \xc5) ion substituted ions in A site for similar ion diameter or occupied the vacancy of A site (NaE^{+} 1.02 \xc5, KE^{+} 1.33 \xc5) forming cation substitution as BiA \u2022\u2022. Meanwhile the AlNb\u2033 was also supposed to be existed in the system. Thus, there were possible defect dipoles forming as BiA \u2022\u2022-VA\u2032 or AlNb\u2033-VO \u2022\u2022 in the ceramics resulting in Peak 2 in the TSDC spectra.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
To investigate the effect of lithium doping on the phase structure of the ceramics, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was obtained, as shown in (a). All peaks were well matched with the PDF card of ICSD 173741 (T phase) and ICSD 380427 (O phase). The relative intensity ratio of peaks (002) and (200) are utilized to quantify the phase structures in KNN ceramics. The relative intensity ratio (I 002/I 200) is approximately 2:1 in orthorhombic phase (O phase, Amm2), while it changes to be around 1:2 for the tetragonal phase (T phase, P4mm). To further present the phase transition with different lithium doping in KNN-BAO ceramics, the enlarged XRD patterns in the range of 22\xb0\u201324\xb0 and 44\xb0\u201347\xb0 are displayed separately in (b and c). The intensity ratio of (I 002/I 200) decreased with addition of lithium dopant in the ceramics. The ratio (I 002/I 200) of samples with x \u2264 0.03 were around 1:2 indicating the orthorhombic phase, while it became about 2:1 for the specimens with 0.04 \u2264 x \u2264 0.06 implying that the coexistence of O phase and T phase, which was consistent with the reported results. To further determine each fraction of O phase and T phase in ceramics with different amounts of lithium doping, Rietveld refinements via GSAS EXPGUI software were utilized for analysis in with R wp < 10 % indicating the reliable results. Various phase structures were tried to best fit the pattern with the database of CIF for O phase (Amm2, Z = 2, COD 7212939) and T phase (P4mm, Z = 1, COD 2104294). The fraction of T phase (P4mm) increases up to 41 % in x = 0.05, while that of the O phase decreases to 51.8 % in x = 0.06 as shown in (f). The c/a ratio for the separate T phase increased with addition of lithium oxide in the ceramics of x = 0.04\u20130.06. The c/a ratio for T phase in the ceramic of x = 0.05 rose up to 1.02, which was in coherence with the reported lithium modified KNN ceramic (c/a 1.024). To further confirm the results from above XRD analysis, Raman spectra characterization for all samples were performed in the range of 100 cmE^{\u22121}-1000 cmE^{\u22121} at room temperature. Vibration modes of NbO6 octahedral were shown in , \u03bd 1 mode was strongly correlated with a symmetric stretching of NbO6 , which implied the structure evolution for phase transitions in KNN based ceramics. No clear variations of Raman shift were observed in the sample of x = 0.03, which meant the less effect on the O phase caused by small amount of li content. With the increase of Li content (x = 0.05, 0.06), the wave numbers of \u03bd 1 peak gradually shifted to a higher frequency, which reflected that the replacement of Li content on A-site caused the oxygen octahedral compression to the center forming T phase. Yang reported  that the enhancement of the hybridization between O 2p and Nb 4d orbitals was observed in Lithium doping KNN based ceramics, which reduced Nb-O bond length and enhanced distortion of Nb-O octahedron along the [001] direction. As shown in the SEM micrographs were obtained on the cross-section of ceramics sintered at 1140 \xb0C for 2h, which had been thermal etched at 1080 \xb0C for 30min before the characterization. For all samples, most of the grains seemed to be rectangular shape, while some grains were irregular. (a) shows the sample with x = 0 consists of small grain (\u223c3 \u03bcm) and large grains (over 10 \u03bcm) with average diameter of \u223c5.39 \u03bcm. When x \u2265 0.05, the grain distribution seemed to be more homogeneous and more round in shape, which indicated that the Li doping improved the growth of grains via formation of liquid phase lowering the surface energy during sintering process. At the same time, the elements distribution of the specimen with x = 0.05 were investigated via EDX analysis. More sections had been selected to confirm the homogeneous element distribution in KNLN-BAO ceramics. To further analyze the phase structure evolution, the dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) and dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) as a function of temperature had been performed for unpoled ceramics with different Li doping contents. As shown in , in the temperature range from \u221255 \xb0C to 480 \xb0C, all samples (0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.06) own two dielectric anomalies, which indicate the coexistence of O phase and T phase at lower temperature (T O-T) and the tetragonal phase-cubic phase at higher temperature (T C). shows that the T O-T decreases dramatically with the increase of Li doping content, while the T C gradually increases in proportion to the addition of Li doping, up to 447 \xb0C for x = 0.06. It clearly shows that the T O-T of x = 0.05 and x = 0.06 shift to the room temperature in. In addition, the P-E hysteresis loops of KNLN-BAO ceramics are displayed in (a), which were characterized at 25 \xb0C with the frequency of 10Hz. The P-E loops for x = 0, 0.03 and 0.04 ceramics were saturated, while it became a slight round shape for x = 0.05 and 0.06, which was mainly due to the existence of leakage current when Li doping content increased. As shown in (b), the remnant polarization (P r) decreases with the increase addition of Li dopant content, meanwhile the coercive field (E c) increases up to the peak for x = 0.05. However, the d 33 increases with the addition of Li doping up to the maximum for x = 0.05, as shown in (c). The enhancement of d 33 in the ceramic with higher permittivity was possibly due to the coexistence of O phase and T phase, where the polarization rotation was expected to be easier due to more polar vectors in ceramic with coexistence of O phase and T phase than that of single phase. As shown in , the pyroelectric property of different lithium doping contents were characterized after the poled samples circuit-shorted for over 24 h typically at room temperature. In (b), it depicts the calculated pyroelectric coefficient from 10 \xb0C to 200 \xb0C and amplified spectroscopy in the range of 10\xb0C\u201350 \xb0C, in which the pyroelectric peaks are strongly correlated with phase transition in ceramics with the anomalous variations of intrinsic spontaneous polarization. The calculated pyroelectric coefficient of x = 0.05 achieved around 3.6 \xd7 10E^{\u22124} C mE^{\u22122} KE^{\u22121} in (c), which was the highest value among the studied gradients. The result should be probably due to the coexistence of O phase and T phase at room temperature facilitating the abrupt variation of polarization with the change of temperature around T d and sufficient poling condition for x = 0.05, which was also demonstrated by the d 33 results. To further confirm the intrinsic pyroelectric contribution of pyroelectric current, second round of heating was performed after first cycle of heating and cooling in the range of 10\xb0C\u201340 \xb0C. The calculated pyroelectric coefficient of x = 0.05 during second heating cycle was 3.11 \xd7 10E^{\u22124} C mE^{\u22122} KE^{\u22121}). As shown in (c), the volume specific heat capacity (C v) of x = 0.05 from 0 \xb0C to 180 \xb0C rises with the increase of temperature. Generally, it should be emphasized that the figure of merits (FOMs) was utilized to assess the pyroelectric performance of materials for the application of infrared detector. FOMs are involved with the current detectivity (F i = p/C v) , voltage detectivity (F v = p/C v \u03b5 r \u03b5 0) and detectivity (F d = p/C v (\u03b5 r \u03b5 0tan\u03b4)E^{1/2}) , where p denotes pyroelectric coefficient, C v indicates the volume specific heat capacity, \u03b5 r indicates the relative dielectric constant, \u03b5 0 denotes the vacuum permittivity, tan\u03b4 indicates dielectric loss. The FOMs (F i, F v and F d) were calculated in the temperature range from 10 \xb0C to 35 \xb0C as shown in (d). As shown in , the pyroelectric performance and FOMs in this study are compared with other reported results. The composition of x = 0.05 for the ceramics presented moderate pyroelectric coefficient p (\u223c3.11 \xd7 10E^{\u22124} C mE^{\u22122} KE^{\u22121}) and F i (\u223c1.460 \xd7 10E^{\u221210} m VE^{\u22121}), but with better F v (\u223c0.0169 mE^{2} CE^{\u22121}) and F d (\u223c0.93 \xd7 10E^{\u22125} PaE^{\u22121/2}) compared with the counterparts, implying potential application of PIRD. TSDC analysis of ferroelectrics are known to be complicated for the pyroelectric effects resulting from the ferroelectric polarization changing with thermal fluctuation. Thus the possible TSDC signals from pyroelectric effect need to be analyzed at first. P-E loops were performed under 1 kV/mm of the ceramic x = 0.05 with the temperature changing from 25 \xb0C to 100 \xb0C as shown in (a). In (b) the P max and P r show less variation with thermal fluctuation indicating that nearly neglected ferroelectric polarization contribution for the TSDC signals. Meanwhile, the piezoelectric response under the condition of TSDC (1 kV/mm, 80 \xb0C, poling for 15min) for the ceramic was tested by d 33 m. No obvious signal of d 33 was detected at room temperature, which meant nearly no contribution of ferroelectric polarization caused by the electric field of 1 kV/mm due to higher coercive field of the ceramic. To further explore the extrinsic contribution of pyroelectric performance at lower temperature, TSDC analysis for the ceramic of x = 0.05 was investigated with different poling voltages from 0.4 kV/mm to 1 kV/mm. As displayed in , two TSDC current of Peak 1 and Peak 2 from \u221220 \xb0C to 200 \xb0C are presented in the pyroelectric current spectra for x = 0.05. With the increase of poling voltage, the peak position of Peak 1 shifted to high temperature, while the position of Peak 2 had no obvious change, suggesting that the Peak 1 should be related to the space charge at the lower temperature. As its widely known that in KNN based ceramics sintering in air, VO \u2022\u2022 is often induced as mobile ions due to the easy volatilization of alkalis metals during sintering process. The non-shifting of Peak 2 in the TSDC spectra indicated possible defect dipole in the ceramics of KNLN-BAO, which was possibly due to the preferable substitution of AlE^{3+} (CN = 6, 0.535 \xc5) for NbE^{5+} (CN = 6, 0.64 \xc5) in the B site. According to the principles of crystal chemistry, it's generally believed that BiE^{3+} (CN = 12, 1.36 \xc5) ion substituted ions in A site for similar ion diameter or occupied the vacancy of A site (NaE^{+} 1.02 \xc5, KE^{+} 1.33 \xc5) forming cation substitution as BiA \u2022\u2022. Meanwhile the AlNb\u2033 was also supposed to be existed in the system. Thus, there were possible defect dipoles forming as BiA \u2022\u2022-VA\u2032 or AlNb\u2033-VO \u2022\u2022 in the ceramics resulting in Peak 2 in the TSDC spectra.
