# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
To investigate the effect of lithium doping on the phase structure of the ceramics, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was obtained, as shown in (a). All peaks were well matched with the PDF card of ICSD 173741 (T phase) and ICSD 380427 (O phase). The relative intensity ratio of peaks (002) and (200) are utilized to quantify the phase structures in KNN ceramics. The relative intensity ratio (I 002/I 200) is approximately 2:1 in orthorhombic phase (O phase, Amm2), while it changes to be around 1:2 for the tetragonal phase (T phase, P4mm). To further present the phase transition with different lithium doping in KNN-BAO ceramics, the enlarged XRD patterns in the range of 22\xb0\u201324\xb0 and 44\xb0\u201347\xb0 are displayed separately in (b and c). The intensity ratio of (I 002/I 200) decreased with addition of lithium dopant in the ceramics. The ratio (I 002/I 200) of samples with x \u2264 0.03 were around 1:2 indicating the orthorhombic phase, while it became about 2:1 for the specimens with 0.04 \u2264 x \u2264 0.06 implying that the coexistence of O phase and T phase, which was consistent with the reported results. To further determine each fraction of O phase and T phase in ceramics with different amounts of lithium doping, Rietveld refinements via GSAS EXPGUI software were utilized for analysis in with R wp < 10 % indicating the reliable results. Various phase structures were tried to best fit the pattern with the database of CIF for O phase (Amm2, Z = 2, COD 7212939) and T phase (P4mm, Z = 1, COD 2104294). The fraction of T phase (P4mm) increases up to 41 % in x = 0.05, while that of the O phase decreases to 51.8 % in x = 0.06 as shown in (f). The c/a ratio for the separate T phase increased with addition of lithium oxide in the ceramics of x = 0.04\u20130.06. The c/a ratio for T phase in the ceramic of x = 0.05 rose up to 1.02, which was in coherence with the reported lithium modified KNN ceramic (c/a 1.024). To further confirm the results from above XRD analysis, Raman spectra characterization for all samples were performed in the range of 100 cmE^{\u22121}-1000 cmE^{\u22121} at room temperature. Vibration modes of NbO6 octahedral were shown in , \u03bd 1 mode was strongly correlated with a symmetric stretching of NbO6 , which implied the structure evolution for phase transitions in KNN based ceramics. No clear variations of Raman shift were observed in the sample of x = 0.03, which meant the less effect on the O phase caused by small amount of li content. With the increase of Li content (x = 0.05, 0.06), the wave numbers of \u03bd 1 peak gradually shifted to a higher frequency, which reflected that the replacement of Li content on A-site caused the oxygen octahedral compression to the center forming T phase. Yang reported  that the enhancement of the hybridization between O 2p and Nb 4d orbitals was observed in Lithium doping KNN based ceramics, which reduced Nb-O bond length and enhanced distortion of Nb-O octahedron along the [001] direction. As shown in the SEM micrographs were obtained on the cross-section of ceramics sintered at 1140 \xb0C for 2h, which had been thermal etched at 1080 \xb0C for 30min before the characterization. For all samples, most of the grains seemed to be rectangular shape, while some grains were irregular. (a) shows the sample with x = 0 consists of small grain (\u223c3 \u03bcm) and large grains (over 10 \u03bcm) with average diameter of \u223c5.39 \u03bcm. When x \u2265 0.05, the grain distribution seemed to be more homogeneous and more round in shape, which indicated that the Li doping improved the growth of grains via formation of liquid phase lowering the surface energy during sintering process. At the same time, the elements distribution of the specimen with x = 0.05 were investigated via EDX analysis. More sections had been selected to confirm the homogeneous element distribution in KNLN-BAO ceramics. To further analyze the phase structure evolution, the dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) and dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) as a function of temperature had been performed for unpoled ceramics with different Li doping contents. As shown in , in the temperature range from \u221255 \xb0C to 480 \xb0C, all samples (0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.06) own two dielectric anomalies, which indicate the coexistence of O phase and T phase at lower temperature (T O-T) and the tetragonal phase-cubic phase at higher temperature (T C). shows that the T O-T decreases dramatically with the increase of Li doping content, while the T C gradually increases in proportion to the addition of Li doping, up to 447 \xb0C for x = 0.06. It clearly shows that the T O-T of x = 0.05 and x = 0.06 shift to the room temperature in. In addition, the P-E hysteresis loops of KNLN-BAO ceramics are displayed in (a), which were characterized at 25 \xb0C with the frequency of 10Hz. The P-E loops for x = 0, 0.03 and 0.04 ceramics were saturated, while it became a slight round shape for x = 0.05 and 0.06, which was mainly due to the existence of leakage current when Li doping content increased. As shown in (b), the remnant polarization (P r) decreases with the increase addition of Li dopant content, meanwhile the coercive field (E c) increases up to the peak for x = 0.05. However, the d 33 increases with the addition of Li doping up to the maximum for x = 0.05, as shown in (c). The enhancement of d 33 in the ceramic with higher permittivity was possibly due to the coexistence of O phase and T phase, where the polarization rotation was expected to be easier due to more polar vectors in ceramic with coexistence of O phase and T phase than that of single phase. As shown in , the pyroelectric property of different lithium doping contents were characterized after the poled samples circuit-shorted for over 24 h typically at room temperature. In (b), it depicts the calculated pyroelectric coefficient from 10 \xb0C to 200 \xb0C and amplified spectroscopy in the range of 10\xb0C\u201350 \xb0C, in which the pyroelectric peaks are strongly correlated with phase transition in ceramics with the anomalous variations of intrinsic spontaneous polarization. The calculated pyroelectric coefficient of x = 0.05 achieved around 3.6 \xd7 10E^{\u22124} C mE^{\u22122} KE^{\u22121} in (c), which was the highest value among the studied gradients. The result should be probably due to the coexistence of O phase and T phase at room temperature facilitating the abrupt variation of polarization with the change of temperature around T d and sufficient poling condition for x = 0.05, which was also demonstrated by the d 33 results. To further confirm the intrinsic pyroelectric contribution of pyroelectric current, second round of heating was performed after first cycle of heating and cooling in the range of 10\xb0C\u201340 \xb0C. The calculated pyroelectric coefficient of x = 0.05 during second heating cycle was 3.11 \xd7 10E^{\u22124} C mE^{\u22122} KE^{\u22121}). As shown in (c), the volume specific heat capacity (C v) of x = 0.05 from 0 \xb0C to 180 \xb0C rises with the increase of temperature. Generally, it should be emphasized that the figure of merits (FOMs) was utilized to assess the pyroelectric performance of materials for the application of infrared detector. FOMs are involved with the current detectivity (F i = p/C v) , voltage detectivity (F v = p/C v \u03b5 r \u03b5 0) and detectivity (F d = p/C v (\u03b5 r \u03b5 0tan\u03b4)E^{1/2}) , where p denotes pyroelectric coefficient, C v indicates the volume specific heat capacity, \u03b5 r indicates the relative dielectric constant, \u03b5 0 denotes the vacuum permittivity, tan\u03b4 indicates dielectric loss. The FOMs (F i, F v and F d) were calculated in the temperature range from 10 \xb0C to 35 \xb0C as shown in (d). As shown in , the pyroelectric performance and FOMs in this study are compared with other reported results. The composition of x = 0.05 for the ceramics presented moderate pyroelectric coefficient p (\u223c3.11 \xd7 10E^{\u22124} C mE^{\u22122} KE^{\u22121}) and F i (\u223c1.460 \xd7 10E^{\u221210} m VE^{\u22121}), but with better F v (\u223c0.0169 mE^{2} CE^{\u22121}) and F d (\u223c0.93 \xd7 10E^{\u22125} PaE^{\u22121/2}) compared with the counterparts, implying potential application of PIRD. TSDC analysis of ferroelectrics are known to be complicated for the pyroelectric effects resulting from the ferroelectric polarization changing with thermal fluctuation. Thus the possible TSDC signals from pyroelectric effect need to be analyzed at first. P-E loops were performed under 1 kV/mm of the ceramic x = 0.05 with the temperature changing from 25 \xb0C to 100 \xb0C as shown in (a). In (b) the P max and P r show less variation with thermal fluctuation indicating that nearly neglected ferroelectric polarization contribution for the TSDC signals. Meanwhile, the piezoelectric response under the condition of TSDC (1 kV/mm, 80 \xb0C, poling for 15min) for the ceramic was tested by d 33 m. No obvious signal of d 33 was detected at room temperature, which meant nearly no contribution of ferroelectric polarization caused by the electric field of 1 kV/mm due to higher coercive field of the ceramic. To further explore the extrinsic contribution of pyroelectric performance at lower temperature, TSDC analysis for the ceramic of x = 0.05 was investigated with different poling voltages from 0.4 kV/mm to 1 kV/mm. As displayed in , two TSDC current of Peak 1 and Peak 2 from \u221220 \xb0C to 200 \xb0C are presented in the pyroelectric current spectra for x = 0.05. With the increase of poling voltage, the peak position of Peak 1 shifted to high temperature, while the position of Peak 2 had no obvious change, suggesting that the Peak 1 should be related to the space charge at the lower temperature. As its widely known that in KNN based ceramics sintering in air, VO \u2022\u2022 is often induced as mobile ions due to the easy volatilization of alkalis metals during sintering process. The non-shifting of Peak 2 in the TSDC spectra indicated possible defect dipole in the ceramics of KNLN-BAO, which was possibly due to the preferable substitution of AlE^{3+} (CN = 6, 0.535 \xc5) for NbE^{5+} (CN = 6, 0.64 \xc5) in the B site. According to the principles of crystal chemistry, it's generally believed that BiE^{3+} (CN = 12, 1.36 \xc5) ion substituted ions in A site for similar ion diameter or occupied the vacancy of A site (NaE^{+} 1.02 \xc5, KE^{+} 1.33 \xc5) forming cation substitution as BiA \u2022\u2022. Meanwhile the AlNb\u2033 was also supposed to be existed in the system. Thus, there were possible defect dipoles forming as BiA \u2022\u2022-VA\u2032 or AlNb\u2033-VO \u2022\u2022 in the ceramics resulting in Peak 2 in the TSDC spectra.

# INTRODUCTION
Pyroelectric infrared detector (PIRD) is one of the promising applications of pyroelectrics on the infrared sensing technologies, which are widely utilized in the temperature sensing , fire alarm, intruder , IR detection, imaging  etc., due to the advantages of high sensitivity, low cost, non-cooling request. For the pyroelectric ceramics, intensive efforts have been devoted to the enhancement of the pyroelectric bulk ceramics based on gradients of Pb, (Na0.5Bi0.5) TiO3 (NBT), (Ba, Sr) TiO3 (BST), BaTiO3 (BTO), NaNbO3, (K0.5, Na0.5) NbO3 (KNN), etc. Reported depolarization temperature (T d) of these lead-free compositions, including NBT , BST , BTO  ceramics, were generally less than 230 \xb0C. Although, lead-containing ceramics  always owned excellent pyro-property, which were widely used in the commercial application of PIRD. Generally, lead-free pyroelectrics composed of NBT or BTO ceramics are widely investigated. Shen  et al. increased the pyroelectric coefficient greatly to 27.2 \xd7 10E^{\u22124} C mE^{\u22122} KE^{\u22121} in 0.94Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3-0.06BaTi0.75Zr0.25O3 ceramics with ultra-low depolarization temperature T d (T d \u223c38 \xb0C, curie temperature T C \u223c300 \xb0C). Patel  et al. investigated 0.5Ba (Zr0.2Ti0.8) O3-0.5(Ba0.7Sr0.3) TiO3 ceramic with pyroelectric coefficient of 3.4 \xd7 10E^{\u22124} C mE^{\u22122} KE^{\u22121} at 303K. In comparison with BST and NBT based ceramics (low T C or T d), the KNN-based ceramics (high T C \u223c420 \xb0C and high spontaneous polarization) have advantages for potential application of PIRD. Compositions of LiTaO3 , LiSbO3 , BKT  and Ba (Ni0.5Nb0.5) O3  were reported to improve the pyroelectric coefficient but with limited values lower than \u223c2.21 \xd7 10E^{\u22124} C mE^{\u22122} KE^{\u22121}. It's obviously noted that chemical modified KNN based ceramics still faced poor device performance for extremely low pyroelectric coefficient in previous reports. Therefore, it's important to improve the pyroelectric performance of KNN based ceramics. For KNN based ceramics, multiple phase transition could be utilized to enhance pyroelectric performance especially by shifting O phase and T phase boundary near room temperature which is demonstrated to greatly enhance piezoelectric performance for KNN based ceramics due to more polarization vectors for coexistence of O phase and T phase. Meanwhile, perovskite ABO3 materials are often adopted to modify KNN in order to induce enhancement in piezoelectric activity by favoring the formation of phase boundaries with low cost as a potential candidate for practical applications. BiAlO3 is a kind of attractive perovskite-type material with high T C and low melting point temperature, which benefits the sintering ability of ceramics and easily forms solid solutions with KNN to facilitate the T O-T and T R-O to room temperature with moderate dielectric constant. Moreover, the sintering property of KNN could be improved by Li composite acting as sintering addictive such as LiNbO3. The addition of lithium oxide lowered down the T O-T and improved T C  due to the extremely high T C (\u223c1200 \xb0C) of LiNbO3. Optimal ratio of Na/K, which was near composition of x = 0.52, showed maximum d 33 in K1-x Na x NbO3 ceramics. So K0.48Na0.52NbO3 (KNN) was chosen to improve pyroelectric response. Thus, the compensation effects of Li and BiAlO3 in KNN materials were expected to enhance pyroelectric property and T C at the same time. The pyroelectric coefficient, p, is related to the pyroelectric current, I p, by the following ratio, p = I p/(A\xb7dT/dt), where A is the area of the electrode and dT/dt is the rate of temperature change. Thermal stimulated current (TSC) was generally utilized to characterize the I p in the direct Byer-Roundy method. Usually the TSC current was also affected by trapped charges or other defects in ceramics during poling process and thermal stimulating process. It should be noted that TSC current might include pyroelectric current I p and other non-pyroelectric current due to contributions from trapped charges or other defects. As its widely known that lots of defects were created, such as oxygen vacancy, vacancies of NaE^{+} and KE^{+} ions, dipoles etc., resulting from the easy volatilization of alkalis metals during sintering process for KNN based ceramics sintering in air. Further, even if the defects in KNN based piezoelectric ceramics were studied extensively, less reports about the extrinsic contribution of defects on pyroelectric current were investigated in KNN based pyroelectrics. In KNN based pyroelectric ceramics, the non-pyroelectric current phenomenon hadn't been clarified ever, thus it's necessary to explore possible defects in the ceramics. Stimulated depolarized current (TSDC) method is powerful technique for researchers to investigate possible type of defects such as defect dipoles, trapped charge, mobile carrier etc. Yet, in KNN based ceramics, it seems to be less effective for application of TSDC method due to the strong ferroelectric behavior below T C causing possible pyroelectric effect during the thermal stimulating process. Proceeding reports  about the experiment method applied on KNN based ceramics was invalid to detect the subtle change of current peak below 200 \xb0C with usually high temperature poling condition (>200 \xb0C) which caused possible missing of useable information for the evolution of defects at low temperature range. It's unavoidable for collecting non-pyroelectric current when the TSDC analysis was conducted over high temperature (>200 \xb0C), where the insulation resistivity degraded, if poled at high temperature especially for KNN based ceramics. In this work, the 0.995(K0.48Na0.52)1-x Li x NbO3-0.005BiAlO3 (x = 0, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05) ceramics were fabricated using solid state reaction method. The manner in which lithium doping contents affected the pyroelectric performance was investigated by the structures and phase composition with characterization of dielectric behavior, polarization variation with electric field and d 33 at room temperature. At the same time, the extrinsic contribution of defects for pyroelectric current generating below 200 \xb0C had been explored primarily by TSDC analysis.

# CONCLUSION
In this work, KNL x N-BAO (0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.06) ceramic were synthesized by solid state reaction method in air. The phase structures of different amounts of Li content were investigated via XRD refinement. The ceramics with x \u2264 0.03 presented the orthorhombic phase while ceramics of 0.04 \u2264 x \u2264 0.06 tended to be the coexistence of O phase and T phase. The T O-T decreased dramatically with the increase of Li content, while the T C increased gradually proportionately with the addition of Li doping and T O-T of x = 0.05 and x = 0.06 were close to the room temperature. The d 33 increased with the addition of Li content gradually and up to the maximum for the sample with x = 0.05. However, the P r decreased with the increase of Li content and the E c increased up to the peak for the sample of x = 0.05. The effect of Li content on pyroelectric property of the KNN based ceramics was investigated. The ceramic of x = 0.05 had moderate pyroelectric property (3.11 \xd7 10E^{\u22124} C mE^{\u22122} KE^{\u22121}) at room temperature with better F v (0.0169 mE^{2} CE^{\u22121}) and F d (\u223c0.93 \xd7 10E^{\u22125} PaE^{\u22121/2}), Which tended to be promising candidate for the application of infrared detector. The evolution of phase transformation tuned by Lithium doping could be effective to enhance the pyroelectric property of KNN based ceramics. Meanwhile, it's first time to obtain valid information of TSDC spectroscopy below 200 \xb0C for KNN based ceramics, which would be a guidance for future researchers. Moreover, the extrinsic contribution of space charge for pyroelectric current and defect dipole associates in KNN based ceramics was demonstrated by TSDC analysis. Moreover, the temperature cycling below the phase transition temperature with circuit-shorted during the process should be advised to release free charge in the measurement of KNN based pyroelectrics.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
To investigate the effect of lithium doping on the phase structure of the ceramics, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was obtained, as shown in (a). All peaks were well matched with the PDF card of ICSD 173741 (T phase) and ICSD 380427 (O phase). The relative intensity ratio of peaks (002) and (200) are utilized to quantify the phase structures in KNN ceramics. The relative intensity ratio (I 002/I 200) is approximately 2:1 in orthorhombic phase (O phase, Amm2), while it changes to be around 1:2 for the tetragonal phase (T phase, P4mm). To further present the phase transition with different lithium doping in KNN-BAO ceramics, the enlarged XRD patterns in the range of 22\xb0\u201324\xb0 and 44\xb0\u201347\xb0 are displayed separately in (b and c). The intensity ratio of (I 002/I 200) decreased with addition of lithium dopant in the ceramics. The ratio (I 002/I 200) of samples with x \u2264 0.03 were around 1:2 indicating the orthorhombic phase, while it became about 2:1 for the specimens with 0.04 \u2264 x \u2264 0.06 implying that the coexistence of O phase and T phase, which was consistent with the reported results. To further determine each fraction of O phase and T phase in ceramics with different amounts of lithium doping, Rietveld refinements via GSAS EXPGUI software were utilized for analysis in with R wp < 10 % indicating the reliable results. Various phase structures were tried to best fit the pattern with the database of CIF for O phase (Amm2, Z = 2, COD 7212939) and T phase (P4mm, Z = 1, COD 2104294). The fraction of T phase (P4mm) increases up to 41 % in x = 0.05, while that of the O phase decreases to 51.8 % in x = 0.06 as shown in (f). The c/a ratio for the separate T phase increased with addition of lithium oxide in the ceramics of x = 0.04\u20130.06. The c/a ratio for T phase in the ceramic of x = 0.05 rose up to 1.02, which was in coherence with the reported lithium modified KNN ceramic (c/a 1.024). To further confirm the results from above XRD analysis, Raman spectra characterization for all samples were performed in the range of 100 cmE^{\u22121}-1000 cmE^{\u22121} at room temperature. Vibration modes of NbO6 octahedral were shown in , \u03bd 1 mode was strongly correlated with a symmetric stretching of NbO6 , which implied the structure evolution for phase transitions in KNN based ceramics. No clear variations of Raman shift were observed in the sample of x = 0.03, which meant the less effect on the O phase caused by small amount of li content. With the increase of Li content (x = 0.05, 0.06), the wave numbers of \u03bd 1 peak gradually shifted to a higher frequency, which reflected that the replacement of Li content on A-site caused the oxygen octahedral compression to the center forming T phase. Yang reported  that the enhancement of the hybridization between O 2p and Nb 4d orbitals was observed in Lithium doping KNN based ceramics, which reduced Nb-O bond length and enhanced distortion of Nb-O octahedron along the [001] direction. As shown in the SEM micrographs were obtained on the cross-section of ceramics sintered at 1140 \xb0C for 2h, which had been thermal etched at 1080 \xb0C for 30min before the characterization. For all samples, most of the grains seemed to be rectangular shape, while some grains were irregular. (a) shows the sample with x = 0 consists of small grain (\u223c3 \u03bcm) and large grains (over 10 \u03bcm) with average diameter of \u223c5.39 \u03bcm. When x \u2265 0.05, the grain distribution seemed to be more homogeneous and more round in shape, which indicated that the Li doping improved the growth of grains via formation of liquid phase lowering the surface energy during sintering process. At the same time, the elements distribution of the specimen with x = 0.05 were investigated via EDX analysis. More sections had been selected to confirm the homogeneous element distribution in KNLN-BAO ceramics. To further analyze the phase structure evolution, the dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) and dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) as a function of temperature had been performed for unpoled ceramics with different Li doping contents. As shown in , in the temperature range from \u221255 \xb0C to 480 \xb0C, all samples (0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.06) own two dielectric anomalies, which indicate the coexistence of O phase and T phase at lower temperature (T O-T) and the tetragonal phase-cubic phase at higher temperature (T C). shows that the T O-T decreases dramatically with the increase of Li doping content, while the T C gradually increases in proportion to the addition of Li doping, up to 447 \xb0C for x = 0.06. It clearly shows that the T O-T of x = 0.05 and x = 0.06 shift to the room temperature in. In addition, the P-E hysteresis loops of KNLN-BAO ceramics are displayed in (a), which were characterized at 25 \xb0C with the frequency of 10Hz. The P-E loops for x = 0, 0.03 and 0.04 ceramics were saturated, while it became a slight round shape for x = 0.05 and 0.06, which was mainly due to the existence of leakage current when Li doping content increased. As shown in (b), the remnant polarization (P r) decreases with the increase addition of Li dopant content, meanwhile the coercive field (E c) increases up to the peak for x = 0.05. However, the d 33 increases with the addition of Li doping up to the maximum for x = 0.05, as shown in (c). The enhancement of d 33 in the ceramic with higher permittivity was possibly due to the coexistence of O phase and T phase, where the polarization rotation was expected to be easier due to more polar vectors in ceramic with coexistence of O phase and T phase than that of single phase. As shown in , the pyroelectric property of different lithium doping contents were characterized after the poled samples circuit-shorted for over 24 h typically at room temperature. In (b), it depicts the calculated pyroelectric coefficient from 10 \xb0C to 200 \xb0C and amplified spectroscopy in the range of 10\xb0C\u201350 \xb0C, in which the pyroelectric peaks are strongly correlated with phase transition in ceramics with the anomalous variations of intrinsic spontaneous polarization. The calculated pyroelectric coefficient of x = 0.05 achieved around 3.6 \xd7 10E^{\u22124} C mE^{\u22122} KE^{\u22121} in (c), which was the highest value among the studied gradients. The result should be probably due to the coexistence of O phase and T phase at room temperature facilitating the abrupt variation of polarization with the change of temperature around T d and sufficient poling condition for x = 0.05, which was also demonstrated by the d 33 results. To further confirm the intrinsic pyroelectric contribution of pyroelectric current, second round of heating was performed after first cycle of heating and cooling in the range of 10\xb0C\u201340 \xb0C. The calculated pyroelectric coefficient of x = 0.05 during second heating cycle was 3.11 \xd7 10E^{\u22124} C mE^{\u22122} KE^{\u22121}). As shown in (c), the volume specific heat capacity (C v) of x = 0.05 from 0 \xb0C to 180 \xb0C rises with the increase of temperature. Generally, it should be emphasized that the figure of merits (FOMs) was utilized to assess the pyroelectric performance of materials for the application of infrared detector. FOMs are involved with the current detectivity (F i = p/C v) , voltage detectivity (F v = p/C v \u03b5 r \u03b5 0) and detectivity (F d = p/C v (\u03b5 r \u03b5 0tan\u03b4)E^{1/2}) , where p denotes pyroelectric coefficient, C v indicates the volume specific heat capacity, \u03b5 r indicates the relative dielectric constant, \u03b5 0 denotes the vacuum permittivity, tan\u03b4 indicates dielectric loss. The FOMs (F i, F v and F d) were calculated in the temperature range from 10 \xb0C to 35 \xb0C as shown in (d). As shown in , the pyroelectric performance and FOMs in this study are compared with other reported results. The composition of x = 0.05 for the ceramics presented moderate pyroelectric coefficient p (\u223c3.11 \xd7 10E^{\u22124} C mE^{\u22122} KE^{\u22121}) and F i (\u223c1.460 \xd7 10E^{\u221210} m VE^{\u22121}), but with better F v (\u223c0.0169 mE^{2} CE^{\u22121}) and F d (\u223c0.93 \xd7 10E^{\u22125} PaE^{\u22121/2}) compared with the counterparts, implying potential application of PIRD. TSDC analysis of ferroelectrics are known to be complicated for the pyroelectric effects resulting from the ferroelectric polarization changing with thermal fluctuation. Thus the possible TSDC signals from pyroelectric effect need to be analyzed at first. P-E loops were performed under 1 kV/mm of the ceramic x = 0.05 with the temperature changing from 25 \xb0C to 100 \xb0C as shown in (a). In (b) the P max and P r show less variation with thermal fluctuation indicating that nearly neglected ferroelectric polarization contribution for the TSDC signals. Meanwhile, the piezoelectric response under the condition of TSDC (1 kV/mm, 80 \xb0C, poling for 15min) for the ceramic was tested by d 33 m. No obvious signal of d 33 was detected at room temperature, which meant nearly no contribution of ferroelectric polarization caused by the electric field of 1 kV/mm due to higher coercive field of the ceramic. To further explore the extrinsic contribution of pyroelectric performance at lower temperature, TSDC analysis for the ceramic of x = 0.05 was investigated with different poling voltages from 0.4 kV/mm to 1 kV/mm. As displayed in , two TSDC current of Peak 1 and Peak 2 from \u221220 \xb0C to 200 \xb0C are presented in the pyroelectric current spectra for x = 0.05. With the increase of poling voltage, the peak position of Peak 1 shifted to high temperature, while the position of Peak 2 had no obvious change, suggesting that the Peak 1 should be related to the space charge at the lower temperature. As its widely known that in KNN based ceramics sintering in air, VO \u2022\u2022 is often induced as mobile ions due to the easy volatilization of alkalis metals during sintering process. The non-shifting of Peak 2 in the TSDC spectra indicated possible defect dipole in the ceramics of KNLN-BAO, which was possibly due to the preferable substitution of AlE^{3+} (CN = 6, 0.535 \xc5) for NbE^{5+} (CN = 6, 0.64 \xc5) in the B site. According to the principles of crystal chemistry, it's generally believed that BiE^{3+} (CN = 12, 1.36 \xc5) ion substituted ions in A site for similar ion diameter or occupied the vacancy of A site (NaE^{+} 1.02 \xc5, KE^{+} 1.33 \xc5) forming cation substitution as BiA \u2022\u2022. Meanwhile the AlNb\u2033 was also supposed to be existed in the system. Thus, there were possible defect dipoles forming as BiA \u2022\u2022-VA\u2032 or AlNb\u2033-VO \u2022\u2022 in the ceramics resulting in Peak 2 in the TSDC spectra.

# INTRODUCTION
Pyroelectric infrared detector (PIRD) is one of the promising applications of pyroelectrics on the infrared sensing technologies, which are widely utilized in the temperature sensing , fire alarm, intruder , IR detection, imaging  etc., due to the advantages of high sensitivity, low cost, non-cooling request. For the pyroelectric ceramics, intensive efforts have been devoted to the enhancement of the pyroelectric bulk ceramics based on gradients of Pb, (Na0.5Bi0.5) TiO3 (NBT), (Ba, Sr) TiO3 (BST), BaTiO3 (BTO), NaNbO3, (K0.5, Na0.5) NbO3 (KNN), etc. Reported depolarization temperature (T d) of these lead-free compositions, including NBT , BST , BTO  ceramics, were generally less than 230 \xb0C. Although, lead-containing ceramics  always owned excellent pyro-property, which were widely used in the commercial application of PIRD. Generally, lead-free pyroelectrics composed of NBT or BTO ceramics are widely investigated. Shen  et al. increased the pyroelectric coefficient greatly to 27.2 \xd7 10E^{\u22124} C mE^{\u22122} KE^{\u22121} in 0.94Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3-0.06BaTi0.75Zr0.25O3 ceramics with ultra-low depolarization temperature T d (T d \u223c38 \xb0C, curie temperature T C \u223c300 \xb0C). Patel  et al. investigated 0.5Ba (Zr0.2Ti0.8) O3-0.5(Ba0.7Sr0.3) TiO3 ceramic with pyroelectric coefficient of 3.4 \xd7 10E^{\u22124} C mE^{\u22122} KE^{\u22121} at 303K. In comparison with BST and NBT based ceramics (low T C or T d), the KNN-based ceramics (high T C \u223c420 \xb0C and high spontaneous polarization) have advantages for potential application of PIRD. Compositions of LiTaO3 , LiSbO3 , BKT  and Ba (Ni0.5Nb0.5) O3  were reported to improve the pyroelectric coefficient but with limited values lower than \u223c2.21 \xd7 10E^{\u22124} C mE^{\u22122} KE^{\u22121}. It's obviously noted that chemical modified KNN based ceramics still faced poor device performance for extremely low pyroelectric coefficient in previous reports. Therefore, it's important to improve the pyroelectric performance of KNN based ceramics. For KNN based ceramics, multiple phase transition could be utilized to enhance pyroelectric performance especially by shifting O phase and T phase boundary near room temperature which is demonstrated to greatly enhance piezoelectric performance for KNN based ceramics due to more polarization vectors for coexistence of O phase and T phase. Meanwhile, perovskite ABO3 materials are often adopted to modify KNN in order to induce enhancement in piezoelectric activity by favoring the formation of phase boundaries with low cost as a potential candidate for practical applications. BiAlO3 is a kind of attractive perovskite-type material with high T C and low melting point temperature, which benefits the sintering ability of ceramics and easily forms solid solutions with KNN to facilitate the T O-T and T R-O to room temperature with moderate dielectric constant. Moreover, the sintering property of KNN could be improved by Li composite acting as sintering addictive such as LiNbO3. The addition of lithium oxide lowered down the T O-T and improved T C  due to the extremely high T C (\u223c1200 \xb0C) of LiNbO3. Optimal ratio of Na/K, which was near composition of x = 0.52, showed maximum d 33 in K1-x Na x NbO3 ceramics. So K0.48Na0.52NbO3 (KNN) was chosen to improve pyroelectric response. Thus, the compensation effects of Li and BiAlO3 in KNN materials were expected to enhance pyroelectric property and T C at the same time. The pyroelectric coefficient, p, is related to the pyroelectric current, I p, by the following ratio, p = I p/(A\xb7dT/dt), where A is the area of the electrode and dT/dt is the rate of temperature change. Thermal stimulated current (TSC) was generally utilized to characterize the I p in the direct Byer-Roundy method. Usually the TSC current was also affected by trapped charges or other defects in ceramics during poling process and thermal stimulating process. It should be noted that TSC current might include pyroelectric current I p and other non-pyroelectric current due to contributions from trapped charges or other defects. As its widely known that lots of defects were created, such as oxygen vacancy, vacancies of NaE^{+} and KE^{+} ions, dipoles etc., resulting from the easy volatilization of alkalis metals during sintering process for KNN based ceramics sintering in air. Further, even if the defects in KNN based piezoelectric ceramics were studied extensively, less reports about the extrinsic contribution of defects on pyroelectric current were investigated in KNN based pyroelectrics. In KNN based pyroelectric ceramics, the non-pyroelectric current phenomenon hadn't been clarified ever, thus it's necessary to explore possible defects in the ceramics. Stimulated depolarized current (TSDC) method is powerful technique for researchers to investigate possible type of defects such as defect dipoles, trapped charge, mobile carrier etc. Yet, in KNN based ceramics, it seems to be less effective for application of TSDC method due to the strong ferroelectric behavior below T C causing possible pyroelectric effect during the thermal stimulating process. Proceeding reports  about the experiment method applied on KNN based ceramics was invalid to detect the subtle change of current peak below 200 \xb0C with usually high temperature poling condition (>200 \xb0C) which caused possible missing of useable information for the evolution of defects at low temperature range. It's unavoidable for collecting non-pyroelectric current when the TSDC analysis was conducted over high temperature (>200 \xb0C), where the insulation resistivity degraded, if poled at high temperature especially for KNN based ceramics. In this work, the 0.995(K0.48Na0.52)1-x Li x NbO3-0.005BiAlO3 (x = 0, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05) ceramics were fabricated using solid state reaction method. The manner in which lithium doping contents affected the pyroelectric performance was investigated by the structures and phase composition with characterization of dielectric behavior, polarization variation with electric field and d 33 at room temperature. At the same time, the extrinsic contribution of defects for pyroelectric current generating below 200 \xb0C had been explored primarily by TSDC analysis.

# CONCLUSION
In this work, KNL x N-BAO (0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.06) ceramic were synthesized by solid state reaction method in air. The phase structures of different amounts of Li content were investigated via XRD refinement. The ceramics with x \u2264 0.03 presented the orthorhombic phase while ceramics of 0.04 \u2264 x \u2264 0.06 tended to be the coexistence of O phase and T phase. The T O-T decreased dramatically with the increase of Li content, while the T C increased gradually proportionately with the addition of Li doping and T O-T of x = 0.05 and x = 0.06 were close to the room temperature. The d 33 increased with the addition of Li content gradually and up to the maximum for the sample with x = 0.05. However, the P r decreased with the increase of Li content and the E c increased up to the peak for the sample of x = 0.05. The effect of Li content on pyroelectric property of the KNN based ceramics was investigated. The ceramic of x = 0.05 had moderate pyroelectric property (3.11 \xd7 10E^{\u22124} C mE^{\u22122} KE^{\u22121}) at room temperature with better F v (0.0169 mE^{2} CE^{\u22121}) and F d (\u223c0.93 \xd7 10E^{\u22125} PaE^{\u22121/2}), Which tended to be promising candidate for the application of infrared detector. The evolution of phase transformation tuned by Lithium doping could be effective to enhance the pyroelectric property of KNN based ceramics. Meanwhile, it's first time to obtain valid information of TSDC spectroscopy below 200 \xb0C for KNN based ceramics, which would be a guidance for future researchers. Moreover, the extrinsic contribution of space charge for pyroelectric current and defect dipole associates in KNN based ceramics was demonstrated by TSDC analysis. Moreover, the temperature cycling below the phase transition temperature with circuit-shorted during the process should be advised to release free charge in the measurement of KNN based pyroelectrics.

**Notes**:
- Write complete chemical formulas (e.g. '(Use the abbreviation key-value pair to track the abbreviations while extracting composition-property keywords). Don't use abbreviations, but you can use different environment if multiple compositions have different d33 values in different environments. For e.g.: 'LiNbO3-Air' and 'LiNbO3-Vacuum'.
- If multiple compositions are mentioned with different d33 values, extract all compositions mentioning different type/environment with a '-' and coreresponding d33 values.
- Mos of the formula are provided in ABSTRACT or INTRODUCTION or first part of EXPERIMENTAL SYNTHESIS.
- Use element symbols (e.g. 'K' not 'Potassium')
- For compositions with variables:
   * If multiple d33 values exist: Extract all compositions by substituting each variable value
   * If single d33 value: Extract only the best composition
- Prioritize data from tables
- Preserve proper chemical notation including:
   * Subscripts for atom counts
   * Parentheses for grouped elements
   * Proper fraction formatting
- Include the measurement unit for d33 values (usually pC/N or pm/V)
- Identify the broader family/class of materials - can be abbreviated forms
- Include if there is any doping in the composition using '+' sign with the composition, e.g. 'LiNbO3 + 2%wt Mg'
- Don't remove brackets or parentheses from the chemical formula which is already in the composition. Also, sometimes fractions are written before the composition (mostly in ()) for composition mixtures, don't remove them.
- Don't modify the abbreviation from referenced papers unless full composition is not available.
- ALWAYS follow the asked JSON format. DON'T write any extra information such as note points or explanations.
