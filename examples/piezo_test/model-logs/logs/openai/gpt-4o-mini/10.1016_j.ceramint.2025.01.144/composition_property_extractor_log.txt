# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The schematic of the MIM structure of the BNKT-20-3M thin-film samples prepared for this study is shown in a. The SEM micrographs of the surfaces of the air-cooled (AC) and liquid nitrogen quenched (LNQ) thin-film samples are shown in b and c, respectively. In the BNKT-20-3M thin-film samples, the uniform and dense grain structure was established during the sol-gel deposition, drying, pyrolysis, and fast annealing (5 min), leaving little room for further morphological changes during cooling/quenching. The Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrate also acted as a thermal sink, reducing the thermal shock experienced by the film. The crystal structures of the thin-film samples were revealed by the XRD analysis, as shown in a. The black and red lines represent the XRD patterns of the AC and LNQ samples, respectively. For comparison, diffraction patterns from the ICSD database for the cubic/pseudo-cubic (C) Pm 3\u203em and rhombohedral (R) R3c space groups of BNT and the tetragonal (T) P4mm space group of BKT are also provided. The fine scans across 2\u03b8 positions of major diffraction peaks, as shown in b\u2212e, indicate that the overall structure of BNKT-20-3M is heavily influenced by the C- and R-phases of BNT, which is expected due to the larger portion of BNT in the solid solution. Furthermore, the minimal difference between the patterns of the AC and LNQ samples suggests that different cooling treatments did not significantly alter the average crystallinity of the BNKT-20-3M thin films. Rietveld refinements were performed on the XRD data using GSAS-II software to estimate the phase proportions and lattice constants of the AC and LNQ samples. The refinements indicate that the AC and LNQ samples contained more than 56% of the C-phase and exhibited similar c/a ratios for the T- and R-phases. Despite this, the LNQ sample had a larger combined proportion of T- and R-phases than the AC sample, indicating a higher degree of lattice asymmetry. It is important to emphasize that XRD provides an \u201caverage\u201d perspective of the crystallographic features, and factors such as microstrain or defects can influence the 2\u03b8 peak positions beyond just the lattice constants. Given the predominantly pseudo-cubic nature of the BNKT-20-3M thin films, structural differences between the two cooling methods (AC vs. LNQ), particularly those occurring at the nanometer scale (e.g., order/disorder arrangement of cations), may not be readily discernible in the XRD measurements. The P-E hysteresis curves of the BNKT-20-3M thin films treated with AC and LNQ are shown in a. It is evident that a faster cooling treatment has induced substantially larger polarization values, with P r increased from 6.9 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} under AC to 12.3 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} under LNQ, and P max increased from 40.6 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} under AC to 56.0 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} under LNQ at 680 kV/cm. The evolutions of Wrec and \u03b7 of the thin films with increasing applied electric field are shown in b. By changing the cooling method from AC to LNQ, Wrec at maximum electric field (680 kV/cm) increased by nearly 23%, from 8.2 to 10.1 J/cmE^{3}; however, the corresponding \u03b7 dropped from 68.0 to 57.4% due to increased P r with a faster cooling treatment. The steps to calculate Wrec and \u03b7 from the P-E hysteresis are readily available in the literature. Since the average crystallinities of the BNKT-20-3M thin films treated with AC and LNQ show little difference based on the XRD results, STEM was applied to examine their nanoscale structural features to shed light on the apparent difference in polarization hysteresis. The bright field image of the BNKT-20-3M thin film (shown in a) indicates that the film prepared by the sol-gel method had a thickness of \u223c220 nm. The HAADF images of electrically poled AC and LNQ samples are shown in b and c, respectively. Contrast fluctuation stemming from the arrangement of different ions is evident in these images. d is the zoom-in HAADF image of the AC sample with an EDS line scan to track the intensities and positions of the Bi and Ti cations. The correlation between the intensity of atom columns in the HAADF image and the intensities of Bi and Ti signals is shown in e. It is evident that the positions of the higher HAADF intensity peaks (i.e., brighter points on the image) correspond to the positions of the heavier A-site Bi cations, while the lower HAADF intensity peaks (i.e., darker points on the image) correspond to the positions of the lighter B-site Ti cations. Once the positions of Bi and Ti were identified, a Python-based package, TEMUL Toolkit , was utilized to extract information on polarizations from the HAADF images. Although the oxygen anions are unable to be observed in the images, the displacement of the B-site Ti cation relative to the geometrical center of the A-site cations, as shown in f, could be used to indicate the electrical dipole present in the perovskite unit cell based on the Born effective charge calculation. a and b show the FFT diffractograms of the AC and LNQ samples, respectively, derived from their HAADF images. The FFT diffractogram indicates that the BNKT-20-3M thin film prepared with AC was predominantly a pseudo-cubic structure. In contrast, the FFT diffractogram of the film prepared with LNQ shows the splitting of high-index spots, indicating the presence of R3c rhombohedral distortion within the pseudo-cubic matrix. Based on the XRD results, Rietveld refinements, and FFT diffractograms, it is evident that the BNKT-20-3M thin film, regardless of the cooling method, contained low symmetry nanoscale domains, which, when overlapped, showed a cubic average symmetry. c and d show the mapping of dipole moments (based on the displacements of B-site Ti cations) on the HAADF images of the BNKT-20-3M thin films prepared with the AC and LNQ methods, respectively. Comparing the size and distribution of colored areas (i.e., could be viewed as ferroelectric domains) in the two maps, it is evident that the AC sample exhibited few but larger domains with a coherence length in the range of 5\u201310 nm, while the LNQ sample showed a distribution of numerous smaller domains (< 5 nm) with non-180\xb0 domain walls. Although the coherence length of the LNQ sample is slightly shorter, the onset of polarization switching for non-180\xb0 domains is typically lower than that of 180\xb0 domains. The non-180\xb0 arrangement of nanoscale domains in the LNQ sample would facilitate the polarization reversal during electric field cycling, especially at small electric fields. A higher degree of lattice distortion in a predominantly pseudo-cubic structure is expected to produce a larger net polarization. e and f show the mapping of c/a ratios on the HAADF images of the BNKT-20-3M thin films prepared with the AC and LNQ methods, respectively. The comparison of c/a ratios in the two maps shows that the LNQ lattice exhibits a slightly higher range (up to 1.25) than the AC lattice (up to 1.14), though their overall ranges largely overlap. When combined with the Rietveld refinement results, the slightly greater lattice asymmetry in the LNQ sample is expected to increase lattice strain, thereby lowering the energy barrier for polarization switching, consistent with Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory calculations. Based on the mapping of domains and c/a ratios of the lattice of the BNKT-20-3M thin films, it is evident that a rapid quenching procedure in liquid nitrogen can induce a large number of PNRs with a high degree of distortion, leading to a non-180\xb0 domain arrangement with soft ferroelectric switching. This was achieved by performing an additional N2 passivation annealing treatment on the thin film at 750 \xb0C for 30 min. Regarding lattice defects, oxygen vacancies (VO) are commonly observed in perovskite oxide thin films. For the BNKT-20-3M sol-gel thin films developed in this study, oxygen vacancies were primarily generated due to the volatilization of cations during pyrolysis and annealing at elevated temperatures, as described in the reactions provided from Equations ). During these processes, oxygen from the surrounding atmosphere reacted with VO in the thin film, leading to the formation of a large number of holes (h\u2219), as depicted in Equation. Although Mn dopants are known to suppress leakage currents by neutralizing excessive holes through the multivalence nature of Mn ions , the residual holes were further mitigated by the subsequent N2 annealing. The reducing atmosphere provided by N2 annealing facilitated the generation of free electrons, as shown in Eq. , which counteracted the holes. This defect passivation process was particularly evident in the LNQ sample, where the rapid cooling limited the charge-balancing effect of multivalent Mn. As a result, the LNQ sample relied more heavily on the subsequent N2 annealing step to effectively neutralize the excessive holes. Additionally, N atoms may be incorporated into the lattice during N2 annealing, potentially filling oxygen vacancy sites and further contributing to the passivation of defects. illustrates the P-E hysteresis curves of the AC and LNQ samples before and after N2 passivation, shown in a and b, respectively. The corresponding Wrec and \u03b7 are presented in c and d. The slimming of the hysteresis loops after N2 passivation highlights a significant reduction in losses, resulting in notable enhancements in energy storage performance for both sample types. For the LNQ sample, N2 annealing substantially increased P max and decreased P r, leading to improved energy storage characteristics with Wrec and \u03b7 reaching close to 12.0 J/cmE^{3} and 70% at an applied electric field of 680 kV/cm, respectively. In contrast, the AC sample exhibited lower P max than the LNQ sample, both before and after N2 passivation, resulting in a correspondingly lower Wrec. Consequently, \u03b7 typically decreases before reaching a plateau unless leakage effects persist, which would continuously elevate the P r value. A combination of a large P max and a small P r is essential for achieving optimal Wrec and \u03b7. d further demonstrates that prior to N2 annealing, the LNQ sample experienced a decline in efficiency at higher electric fields due to leakage effects. This degradation was effectively mitigated after N2 annealing, underscoring the success of defect passivation through N2 heat treatment. For the AC sample, leakage was minimal even before N2 annealing, resulting in comparable efficiencies before and after passivation. compares the Wrec and \u03b7 values of the AC and LNQ samples with N2 passivation from this study to those reported for similar thin-film systems in the literature. To ensure a fair comparison, only lead-free perovskite thin films with thicknesses between 200 and 350 nm and measured under a maximum applied electric field of less than 2000 kV/cm were included. The data in demonstrate that the AC and LNQ samples with N2 passivation rank among the top performers in energy storage, offering an excellent combination of high Wrec and \u03b7 values. Instead, it focuses on demonstrating how variations in the cooling process can be strategically utilized to tailor the ferroelectric, domain, and energy storage properties of BNT-based thin films.

# ABSTRACT
A comparison study of air cooling (AC) and liquid nitrogen quenching (LNQ) on the ferroelectric, domain, and energy storage properties of 3Â mol% Mn-doped 0.8(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3â0.2(Bi0.5K0.5)TiO3 thin films prepared via the sol-gel method was performed. LNQ treatment resulted in softer ferroelectricity with larger remanent polarization (P
                     r) and maximum polarization (P
                     max) compared to AC treatment. Specifically, LNQ increased the film's recoverable energy storage density (Wrec) by nearly 23% at 680Â kV/cm, from 8.2 to 10.1Â J/cm3, although efficiency (Î·) dropped to 57.4% due to increased P
                     r. Regardless of the cooling method, additional nitrogen (N2) passivation annealing at 750Â Â°C slimmed down the film's polarization hysteresis and improved energy storage performance by reducing leakage and internal field. With LNQ followed by N2 annealing, the film's Wrec and Î· reached close to 12.0Â J/cm3 and 70% at 680Â kV/cm, respectively. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) analysis of the film revealed a predominantly pseudo-cubic structure. Through cation displacement, dipole moment, and c/a ratio mapping of the HAADF images, it has been shown that LNQ treatment induced larger lattice distortion with numerous small domains (< 5Â nm) forming non-180Â° domain walls.

# INTRODUCTION
For decades, researchers have focused on developing lead-free perovskite ferroelectrics as alternatives to Pb(Zr x Ti1-x )O3 (PZT)-based systems to address the challenges associated with handling toxic, lead-contained materials. Among the potential candidates, Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 (BNT) has emerged as one of the top choices, owing to its large remanent polarization (P r) and its tailorability to form A-site or B-site relaxor-ferroelectrics with a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) region via elemental doping or solid-solution approaches. Extensive studies have focused on the dielectric and piezoelectric properties of (1-x)(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3\u2013xBaTiO3 (abbreviated as BNBT-100x) and (1-y)(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3\u2013y(Bi0.5K0.5)TiO3 (abbreviated as BNKT-100y) solid solutions. These two BNT-based solid solutions exhibit rhombohedral (R)-tetragonal (T) MPB compositions at x = 0.06\u20130.07 for BNBT-100x and y = 0.16\u20130.20 for BNKT-100y. Building upon these solid solutions, a ternary system, a(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3\u2013bBaTiO3\u2013c(Bi0.5K0.5)TiO3 (abbreviated as BNBK 100a/100b/100c), has also been developed. Notably, bulk ceramics of BNBK 85.4/2.6/12, an MPB composition, exhibited an electrostrain of \u223c0.14%, an apparent piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) of 295 pC/N, and a P r of 22.5 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} under low-frequency electric field cycling. The MPB compositions of BNT-based relaxor-ferroelectrics typically exhibit core-shell grains with a mixture of T- and R-phases, along with polar nano-regions (PNRs) possessing an average pseudo-cubic symmetry. Their diffuse phase transition (DPT) behavior has been attributed to the heterogeneous distribution of cations of higher valences and concentrations (i.e., BiE^{3+} and TiE^{4+}) across the core-shell grains. Increasing the degree of disorder in the BNT-based relaxors can effectively reduce the P r value and slim the polarization hysteresis, which is particularly beneficial for energy storage applications. Research on dielectric energy storage and methods for calculating performance metrics, such as recoverable energy storage density (Wrec) and efficiency (\u03b7), from the polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis curves of candidate materials have been well-documented. BNT-based relaxor-ferroelectrics are promising candidates due to their notable polarization values and excellent temperature stability. Beyond doping, recent studies have shown that quenching from high annealing temperatures or applying specific thermal treatments is an effective method for tailoring PNR characteristics and optimizing electrical properties. BNT-based bulk ceramics quenched from 1150\u2013600 \xb0C in liquid nitrogen have achieved an optimal combination of a large d 33 (\u223c232 pC/N) and a high depolarization temperature (188 \xb0C), attributed to enhanced ferroelectric ordering and the redistribution of A-site cations. Furthermore, quench-induced oxygen vacancies have been shown to pin domain walls, contributing to the temperature stability of BNT-based relaxors. While most studies have focused on bulk ceramics due to their ease of processing and characterization, the quenching effect on BNT-based thin films remains largely unexplored. In this study, quenching from an annealing temperature of 750 \xb0C was incorporated into the heat treatment of 3 mol% Mn-doped BNKT-20 relaxor-ferroelectric thin films. This approach aimed to induce a significant proportion of PNRs while maintaining sufficient A-site order in the films. The objective was to enhance nonlinear switching, thereby increasing the maximum polarization (P max) at high electric fields while limiting the increase of P r, ultimately improving the films\u2019 energy storage density.

# CONCLUSION
This study examined the effects of air cooling and liquid nitrogen quenching on the ferroelectric, domain, and energy storage properties of 3 mol% Mn-doped BNKT-20 thin films. Compared to the AC treatment, LNQ treatment resulted in softer ferroelectric behavior, characterized by higher values of P r and P max. Changing the cooling process from AC to LNQ boosted the Wrec at 680 kV/cm by approximately 23%, rising from 8.2 to 10.1 J/cmE^{3}, albeit with a decrease in \u03b7 to 57.4% due to increased P r. Regardless of the cooling method, subsequent N2 passivation annealing at 750 \xb0C slimmed down the film's polarization hysteresis by reducing leakage and internal field caused by charge defects in the lattice, thereby improving overall energy storage performance. When LNQ treatment was combined with N2 passivation, the film's Wrec and \u03b7 reached close to 12.0 J/cmE^{3} and 70% at 680 kV/cm, respectively. HAADF-STEM analysis of the film revealed that the LNQ treatment induced larger lattice distortion with numerous smaller domains (< 5 nm) forming non-180\xb0 domain walls. This study shows that combining liquid nitrogen quenching and N2 passivation annealing is a promising approach for tailoring BNT-based relaxor-ferroelectric thin films for specific applications.

Contrast fluctuation stemming from the arrangement of different ions is evident in these images. d is the zoom-in HAADF image of the AC sample with an EDS line scan to track the intensities and positions of the Bi and Ti cations. The correlation between the intensity of atom columns in the HAADF image and the intensities of Bi and Ti signals is shown in e. It is evident that the positions of the higher HAADF intensity peaks (i.e., brighter points on the image) correspond to the positions of the heavier A-site Bi cations, while the lower HAADF intensity peaks (i.e., darker points on the image) correspond to the positions of the lighter B-site Ti cations. Once the positions of Bi and Ti were identified, a Python-based package, TEMUL Toolkit , was utilized to extract information on polarizations from the HAADF images. Although the oxygen anions are unable to be observed in the images, the displacement of the B-site Ti cation relative to the geometrical center of the A-site cations, as shown in f, could be used to indicate the electrical dipole present in the perovskite unit cell based on the Born effective charge calculation. a and b show the FFT diffractograms of the AC and LNQ samples, respectively, derived from their HAADF images. The FFT diffractogram indicates that the BNKT-20-3M thin film prepared with AC was predominantly a pseudo-cubic structure. In contrast, the FFT diffractogram of the film prepared with LNQ shows the splitting of high-index spots, indicating the presence of R3c rhombohedral distortion within the pseudo-cubic matrix. Based on the XRD results, Rietveld refinements, and FFT diffractograms, it is evident that the BNKT-20-3M thin film, regardless of the cooling method, contained low symmetry nanoscale domains, which, when overlapped, showed a cubic average symmetry. c and d show the mapping of dipole moments (based on the displacements of B-site Ti cations) on the HAADF images of the BNKT-20-3M thin films prepared with the AC and LNQ methods, respectively. Comparing the size and distribution of colored areas (i.e., could be viewed as ferroelectric domains) in the two maps, it is evident that the AC sample exhibited few but larger domains with a coherence length in the range of 5\u201310 nm, while the LNQ sample showed a distribution of numerous smaller domains (< 5 nm) with non-180\xb0 domain walls. Although the coherence length of the LNQ sample is slightly shorter, the onset of polarization switching for non-180\xb0 domains is typically lower than that of 180\xb0 domains. The non-180\xb0 arrangement of nanoscale domains in the LNQ sample would facilitate the polarization reversal during electric field cycling, especially at small electric fields. A higher degree of lattice distortion in a predominantly pseudo-cubic structure is expected to produce a larger net polarization. e and f show the mapping of c/a ratios on the HAADF images of the BNKT-20-3M thin films prepared with the AC and LNQ methods, respectively. The comparison of c/a ratios in the two maps shows that the LNQ lattice exhibits a slightly higher range (up to 1.25) than the AC lattice (up to 1.14), though their overall ranges largely overlap. When combined with the Rietveld refinement results, the slightly greater lattice asymmetry in the LNQ sample is expected to increase lattice strain, thereby lowering the energy barrier for polarization switching, consistent with Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory calculations. Based on the mapping of domains and c/a ratios of the lattice of the BNKT-20-3M thin films, it is evident that a rapid quenching procedure in liquid nitrogen can induce a large number of PNRs with a high degree of distortion, leading to a non-180\xb0 domain arrangement with soft ferroelectric switching. This was achieved by performing an additional N2 passivation annealing treatment on the thin film at 750 \xb0C for 30 min. Regarding lattice defects, oxygen vacancies (VO) are commonly observed in perovskite oxide thin films. For the BNKT-20-3M sol-gel thin films developed in this study, oxygen vacancies were primarily generated due to the volatilization of cations during pyrolysis and annealing at elevated temperatures, as described in the reactions provided from Equations ). During these processes, oxygen from the surrounding atmosphere reacted with VO in the thin film, leading to the formation of a large number of holes (h\u2219), as depicted in Equation. Although Mn dopants are known to suppress leakage currents by neutralizing excessive holes through the multivalence nature of Mn ions , the residual holes were further mitigated by the subsequent N2 annealing. The reducing atmosphere provided by N2 annealing facilitated the generation of free electrons, as shown in Eq. , which counteracted the holes. This defect passivation process was particularly evident in the LNQ sample, where the rapid cooling limited the charge-balancing effect of multivalent Mn. As a result, the LNQ sample relied more heavily on the subsequent N2 annealing step to effectively neutralize the excessive holes. Additionally, N atoms may be incorporated into the lattice during N2 annealing, potentially filling oxygen vacancy sites and further contributing to the passivation of defects. illustrates the P-E hysteresis curves of the AC and LNQ samples before and after N2 passivation, shown in a and b, respectively. The corresponding Wrec and \u03b7 are presented in c and d. The slimming of the hysteresis loops after N2 passivation highlights a significant reduction in losses, resulting in notable enhancements in energy storage performance for both sample types. For the LNQ sample, N2 annealing substantially increased P max and decreased P r, leading to improved energy storage characteristics with Wrec and \u03b7 reaching close to 12.0 J/cmE^{3} and 70% at an applied electric field of 680 kV/cm, respectively. In contrast, the AC sample exhibited lower P max than the LNQ sample, both before and after N2 passivation, resulting in a correspondingly lower Wrec. Consequently, \u03b7 typically decreases before reaching a plateau unless leakage effects persist, which would continuously elevate the P r value. A combination of a large P max and a small P r is essential for achieving optimal Wrec and \u03b7. d further demonstrates that prior to N2 annealing, the LNQ sample experienced a decline in efficiency at higher electric fields due to leakage effects. This degradation was effectively mitigated after N2 annealing, underscoring the success of defect passivation through N2 heat treatment. For the AC sample, leakage was minimal even before N2 annealing, resulting in comparable efficiencies before and after passivation. compares the Wrec and \u03b7 values of the AC and LNQ samples with N2 passivation from this study to those reported for similar thin-film systems in the literature. To ensure a fair comparison, only lead-free perovskite thin films with thicknesses between 200 and 350 nm and measured under a maximum applied electric field of less than 2000 kV/cm were included. The data in demonstrate that the AC and LNQ samples with N2 passivation rank among the top performers in energy storage, offering an excellent combination of high Wrec and \u03b7 values. Instead, it focuses on demonstrating how variations in the cooling process can be strategically utilized to tailor the ferroelectric, domain, and energy storage properties of BNT-based thin films.

# ABSTRACT
A comparison study of air cooling (AC) and liquid nitrogen quenching (LNQ) on the ferroelectric, domain, and energy storage properties of 3Â mol% Mn-doped 0.8(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3â0.2(Bi0.5K0.5)TiO3 thin films prepared via the sol-gel method was performed. LNQ treatment resulted in softer ferroelectricity with larger remanent polarization (P
                     r) and maximum polarization (P
                     max) compared to AC treatment. Specifically, LNQ increased the film's recoverable energy storage density (Wrec) by nearly 23% at 680Â kV/cm, from 8.2 to 10.1Â J/cm3, although efficiency (Î·) dropped to 57.4% due to increased P
                     r. Regardless of the cooling method, additional nitrogen (N2) passivation annealing at 750Â Â°C slimmed down the film's polarization hysteresis and improved energy storage performance by reducing leakage and internal field. With LNQ followed by N2 annealing, the film's Wrec and Î· reached close to 12.0Â J/cm3 and 70% at 680Â kV/cm, respectively. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) analysis of the film revealed a predominantly pseudo-cubic structure. Through cation displacement, dipole moment, and c/a ratio mapping of the HAADF images, it has been shown that LNQ treatment induced larger lattice distortion with numerous small domains (< 5Â nm) forming non-180Â° domain walls.

# INTRODUCTION
For decades, researchers have focused on developing lead-free perovskite ferroelectrics as alternatives to Pb(Zr x Ti1-x )O3 (PZT)-based systems to address the challenges associated with handling toxic, lead-contained materials. Among the potential candidates, Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 (BNT) has emerged as one of the top choices, owing to its large remanent polarization (P r) and its tailorability to form A-site or B-site relaxor-ferroelectrics with a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) region via elemental doping or solid-solution approaches. Extensive studies have focused on the dielectric and piezoelectric properties of (1-x)(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3\u2013xBaTiO3 (abbreviated as BNBT-100x) and (1-y)(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3\u2013y(Bi0.5K0.5)TiO3 (abbreviated as BNKT-100y) solid solutions. These two BNT-based solid solutions exhibit rhombohedral (R)-tetragonal (T) MPB compositions at x = 0.06\u20130.07 for BNBT-100x and y = 0.16\u20130.20 for BNKT-100y. Building upon these solid solutions, a ternary system, a(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3\u2013bBaTiO3\u2013c(Bi0.5K0.5)TiO3 (abbreviated as BNBK 100a/100b/100c), has also been developed. Notably, bulk ceramics of BNBK 85.4/2.6/12, an MPB composition, exhibited an electrostrain of \u223c0.14%, an apparent piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) of 295 pC/N, and a P r of 22.5 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} under low-frequency electric field cycling. The MPB compositions of BNT-based relaxor-ferroelectrics typically exhibit core-shell grains with a mixture of T- and R-phases, along with polar nano-regions (PNRs) possessing an average pseudo-cubic symmetry. Their diffuse phase transition (DPT) behavior has been attributed to the heterogeneous distribution of cations of higher valences and concentrations (i.e., BiE^{3+} and TiE^{4+}) across the core-shell grains. Increasing the degree of disorder in the BNT-based relaxors can effectively reduce the P r value and slim the polarization hysteresis, which is particularly beneficial for energy storage applications. Research on dielectric energy storage and methods for calculating performance metrics, such as recoverable energy storage density (Wrec) and efficiency (\u03b7), from the polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis curves of candidate materials have been well-documented. BNT-based relaxor-ferroelectrics are promising candidates due to their notable polarization values and excellent temperature stability. Beyond doping, recent studies have shown that quenching from high annealing temperatures or applying specific thermal treatments is an effective method for tailoring PNR characteristics and optimizing electrical properties. BNT-based bulk ceramics quenched from 1150\u2013600 \xb0C in liquid nitrogen have achieved an optimal combination of a large d 33 (\u223c232 pC/N) and a high depolarization temperature (188 \xb0C), attributed to enhanced ferroelectric ordering and the redistribution of A-site cations. Furthermore, quench-induced oxygen vacancies have been shown to pin domain walls, contributing to the temperature stability of BNT-based relaxors. While most studies have focused on bulk ceramics due to their ease of processing and characterization, the quenching effect on BNT-based thin films remains largely unexplored. In this study, quenching from an annealing temperature of 750 \xb0C was incorporated into the heat treatment of 3 mol% Mn-doped BNKT-20 relaxor-ferroelectric thin films. This approach aimed to induce a significant proportion of PNRs while maintaining sufficient A-site order in the films. The objective was to enhance nonlinear switching, thereby increasing the maximum polarization (P max) at high electric fields while limiting the increase of P r, ultimately improving the films\u2019 energy storage density.

# CONCLUSION
This study examined the effects of air cooling and liquid nitrogen quenching on the ferroelectric, domain, and energy storage properties of 3 mol% Mn-doped BNKT-20 thin films. Compared to the AC treatment, LNQ treatment resulted in softer ferroelectric behavior, characterized by higher values of P r and P max. Changing the cooling process from AC to LNQ boosted the Wrec at 680 kV/cm by approximately 23%, rising from 8.2 to 10.1 J/cmE^{3}, albeit with a decrease in \u03b7 to 57.4% due to increased P r. Regardless of the cooling method, subsequent N2 passivation annealing at 750 \xb0C slimmed down the film's polarization hysteresis by reducing leakage and internal field caused by charge defects in the lattice, thereby improving overall energy storage performance. When LNQ treatment was combined with N2 passivation, the film's Wrec and \u03b7 reached close to 12.0 J/cmE^{3} and 70% at 680 kV/cm, respectively. HAADF-STEM analysis of the film revealed that the LNQ treatment induced larger lattice distortion with numerous smaller domains (< 5 nm) forming non-180\xb0 domain walls. This study shows that combining liquid nitrogen quenching and N2 passivation annealing is a promising approach for tailoring BNT-based relaxor-ferroelectric thin films for specific applications.
