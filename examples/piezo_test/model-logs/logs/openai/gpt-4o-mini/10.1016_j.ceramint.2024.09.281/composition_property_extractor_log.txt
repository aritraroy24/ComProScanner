# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
To verify this, specific local structures and tetragonal phases were used to manipulate the free-energy distribution in the prepared PYN\u2013PHT\u2013Ta ceramics in different ways, providing a "deep and flat" free-energy landscape. Traditional ferroelectric systems are usually characterized by long-range-ordered domain structures, whereas relaxor ferroelectrics are characterized by local structures that are inhomogeneous on the nanoscale, which gives rise to the presence of numerous polar nanoregions (PNRs). Previous studies have shown that introducing cations at the B-sites of PYN\u2013PHT ceramics can provide a high level of charge inhomogeneity, thereby resulting in strong relaxor behavior. Moreover, the lattice is almost entirely composed of tetragonal phases exhibiting significant anisotropy, which helps to form a deep energy landscape as well as an enhanced \u0394G. As far as we are aware, such a microstructure within the PYN-PHT system has not previously been identified in any ceramics possessing an ultrahigh piezoelectric coefficient. The PYN\u2013PHT system features highly dispersed local inhomogeneous structures, small domain sizes, and high domain density, which results in the creation of a flat potential landscape. Here, we propose a design strategy for PYN\u2013PHT\u2013xTa based on doping, which endows them with a "mixed-state" structure featuring the coexistence large and small domains. In summary, this strategy provides a novel approach to tailor the structure and performance of piezoelectric materials (see ). shows the XRD patterns of PYN\u2013PHT\u2013xTa piezoelectric ceramics in the angular range of 10\xb0\u201380\xb0. The patterns reveal the presence of the ABO3 perovskite structure with no additional impurity peaks. This confirms that TaE^{5+} ions were effectively incorporated into the PYN\u2013PHT lattice, forming a homogeneous solid solution. For further analysis, a local magnification of the 42\xb0\u201346\xb0 range was performed, which shows the presence of a distinct split in the (200) and (002) diffraction peaks, signifying that the phase structure of the six ceramic samples is predominantly tetragonal. Based on the principle of similar ionic radius, TaE^{5+} ions (0.64 \xc5) should replace TiE^{4+} ions (0.61 \xc5), resulting in donor doping. The refinement curves and experimental curves for each component match well, with wR% and GOF values within acceptable ranges, demonstrating the accuracy of the refinement results. The results show that with the addition of TaE^{5+} dopant ions, the lattice constants change and the structure exhibits a single tetragonal phase. The c/a ratios of 1.020, 1.023, 1.022, 1.017, 1.021, and 1.021 for x ranging from 0 to 1.5 mol% indicate a slight lattice distortion of the tetragonal unit cell, which affects polarization reversal and domain switching, enhancing the piezoelectric properties of the PYN\u2013PHT\u2013xTa ceramics. To examine the inherent effect of grain size on the piezoelectric response of the ceramics, (a)\u2013(f) illustrate the microstructure of six ceramic groups (with different x) sintered at 1175 \xb0C. Using the ImageJ software and the line-intercept method, the average grain size (AGS) was calculated for 50 selected grains. The results indicate that the AGSs are 4.07, 3.18, 2.61, 2.56, 1.95, and 1.89 \u03bcm for x = 0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, and 1.5 mol%, respectively. The AGS decreases with increasing x, which is likely due to the fact that TaE^{5+} doping can create cation vacancies at the grain boundaries. TaE^{5+} ion doping significantly alters the microstructural characteristics of the ceramics. Overall, all six samples exhibit dense microstructures and no holes or disintegration. (g) and (h) show the variation in piezoelectric constant(d 33), bulk density(\u03c1 1 ), relative density(\u03c1 2 ) and electromechanical coupling factor (k p ) with x. From (g), it can be seen that the \u03c1(\u03c1 1, \u03c1 2 ) and d 33 of the PYN\u2013PHT\u2013xTa ceramics initially increase with increasing x and then gradually decrease when x > 0.6. The d 33 value increases from 448 to 560 pC/N, and the \u03c1 reaches a maximum value of 8.82 g/cm\xb3 at x = 0.6. Here, the kp of PYN\u2013PHT\u2013xTa ceramics is positively correlated with their d 33 , as depicted in (h). At a doping level of 0.6 mol%, k p reaches a peak of 0.7. The increase in the number of lead vacancies caused by Ta2O5 doping is the primary reason for the enhancement of k p. shows the EDS spectra of the PYN\u2013PHT\u20130.6Ta sample, which reveals that each element is uniformly distributed within the grains without any aggregation at grain boundaries, ensuring excellent piezoelectric performance. (b) displays the percentage of each element in the ceramic, which is consistent with the stoichiometric ratio of the PYN\u2013PHT\u20130.6Ta system. However, due to the volatility of Pb, a small amount of Pb is inevitably lost during high-temperature sintering, resulting in slightly lower Pb content than the theoretical value.  (a) provides the variation of the relative permittivity (\u025b r ) of PYN\u2013PHT\u2013xTa ceramics with temperature. The curves of all ceramic samples exhibit similar trends, with the relative permittivity showing a single\u2013peak model, reaching the maximum value at the Curie temperature (T C ). A single dielectric peak is present in the temperature range from room temperature (RT) to 500 \xb0C, indicating that no other phase transitions occur and demonstrating a strong thermal stability of the ceramics. For relaxor ferroelectrics, the relationship between permittivity and temperature is fitted using the Curie\u2013Weiss law (also known as the Uchino and Nomura equation) : where C denotes the Curie constant, and \u03b3 is the dispersion factor (1 < \u03b3 < 2), which corresponds to the slope of the line fitting the ln(1/\u025b \u2013 1/\u025b max ) vs. ln(T \u2212 T max) curve. (b) shows the \u03b3 values of PYN\u2013PHT\u2013xTa ceramics. When \u03b3 approaches 1, the ceramics exhibit characteristics of classical ferroelectric materials, whereas when \u03b3 approaches 2, they exhibit characteristics of disordered relaxor ferroelectrics. \u025b r and \u025b max denote the permittivity of the sample at temperatures T and T max, respectively. Specifically, as x increases from 0 to 0.3 mol% and then to 0.6 mol%, \u03b3 increases from 1.52 to 1.61 and then to 1.77, respectively. For x = 0.9, 1.2, and 1.5 mol%, the \u03b3 values are 1.61, 1.58, and 1.60, respectively. The sample with x = 0.6 mol% exhibits the strongest dielectric relaxation. Both the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 and \u03b3 attain their peak values when x is 0.6 mol%, which endows the corresponding ceramic with enhanced relaxor characteristics. This is a key factor contributing to their improved piezoelectric response. (c) illustrates the dielectric characteristics of the PYN\u2013PHT\u2013xTa ceramic system. It's important to highlight that, despite modest reductions, the Curie temperature (T C ) of all samples maintains a significant level of stability, ranging from 312.2 \xb0C to 321.4 \xb0C. It can be observed that the relative dielectric constant (\u03b5) and the dielectric loss tangent (tan\u03b4) are inversely related. The tan\u03b4 first decreases and then increases with the increase in x. The \u03b5 can be easily controlled in perovskite ferroelectrics systems: An increase in d 33 is usually associated with an increase in dielectric constant. Therefore, for the sample with x = 0.6 mol%, the maximum \u03b5 r is 1998.67 and the minimum tan\u03b4 is 0.0208. (a)\u2013(f) illustrate how the reciprocal of the dielectric constant varies with temperature for PYN\u2013PHT\u2013xTa ceramics at a frequency of 1 kHz. T B is the critical temperature for the emergence of polar nanoregions (PNRs). Diffuseness is emblematic of relaxor ferroelectric behavior, and T m indicates the temperature at which the dielectric constant attains its apex, denoted as \u03b5 max. The relaxor behavior of PYN\u2013PHT\u2013xTa ceramics is explained by \u0394T = T B \u2212 T m. The larger the \u0394T value, the stronger the relaxor behavior. For lead-based relaxors, it is generally acknowledged that dielectric relaxation is closely related to the appearance of PNRs. As shown in (a)\u2013(f), with the increase in x, this ternary system exhibits enhanced relaxor behavior, which is consistent with the results (\u03b3) in (c). The enhanced relaxor behavior can also explain the incorporation of TaE^{5+} ions introduces B-site charged defects, which create a random internal field, disrupting the long-range order, which results in improved piezoelectricity. The P\u2013E loops of PYN\u2013PHT\u2013xTa ceramics are illustrated in (a). All PYN\u2013PHT samples exhibit well-fined square P\u2013E hysteresis loops, indicating their excellent ferroelectric properties. P r and E c exhibit opposite trends; P r reaches the maximum value (50.58 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}) as x increases up to 1.2 mol%. The E c of the ceramic samples decreases from 11.33 kV/cm for the pristine (x = 0 mol%) to 10.15 kV/cm for the sample (x = 0.6 mol%). The variation in E c is related to the increased mobility of the ferroelectric domains due to the introduction of high-valent TaE^{5+} ions, which is also one of the reasons for the enhancement of the remanent polarization. (c) illustrates the S\u2013E curves of the PYN\u2013PHT ceramics doped with various amounts of Ta2O5. The sample with 0.6 mol% Ta exhibits the maximal electrostrain value (0.156 %) measured under maximal electric field of 30 kV/cm. (d) shows the relationship between d 33 and \u025b r P r , which is expressed by the following equation: where Q represents the electrostrictive coefficient. Based on thermodynamic theory, d 33 is proportional to the product of P r and \u025b r. As shown in the figure, d 33 and \u025b r P r exhibit the same trend. To delve into the high piezoelectric performance of PYN\u2013PHT\u2013xTa ceramics, the Rayleigh analysis method was employed to explain the intrinsic and extrinsic contributions, which can be expressed as follows : where S(E) represents the strain induced by the electric field, E 0 is the magnitude of the external electric field, d init represents the intrinsic contribution (polarization rotation), and \u03b1E 0 is the extrinsic contribution (phase transition and irreversible domain wall motion). To avoid domain wall switching, Rayleigh analysis was investigated under a small electric field (E 0), with E 0 \u226a E c. As shown in (a), the correlation between the inverse piezoelectric coefficient and the electric field E 0 can be accurately represented by a linear fit. This indicates that the Rayleigh law applies to the PYN\u2013PHT\u2013xTa system. (b) depicts that both \u03b1 and d init follow a similar trend, initially rising with the increase in x, peaking at their highest values when x equals 0.6 mol% (2.52 \xd7 10E^{\u221216} mE^{2}/VE^{2} and 403 p.m./V, respectively), and subsequently declining. The excellent piezoelectric performance of the ceramic with x = 0.6 mol% is attributed to the synergistic contribution of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Similar phenomena have been previously reported in PZ\u2013PT\u2013BNT  and PNN\u2013PIN\u2013PT  ceramics. Here, the local piezoresponse and mesoscopic domain structures was investigated through piezoelectric force microscope (PFM). (a) and (b) reveal that the ceramic with x = 0 mol% exhibits large domains. Inversely, for x = 0.6 mol%, island domain configurations characterized by distinct contracts are displayed configurations within 5 \xd7 5 \u03bcmE^{2} region. Additionally, in comparison to the B-site atoms in the original perovskite structure, doping with TaE^{5+} ions inevitably introduces differences in valence state, ionic radius, and electronegativity, distorting the perovskite structure. Thus, the presence of nanodomains in the PYN\u2013PHT\u20130.6Ta sample promotes polarization rotation, flattening the Gibbs free-energy distribution and thereby generating a higher piezoelectric activity. To gain deeper insight into domain change behavior under an electric field for the samples with x = 0 and 0.6 mol%, we wrote domains in these ceramics at RT using the \u201cLitho\u201d mode of PFM, as shown in (c) and (d). For a given DC voltage, the degree of domain switching differs between the two samples. For the sample with x = 0 mol%, due to its long-range-ordered ferroelectric domains, only partial switching occurs under a +10 V voltage ((c)). By contrast, under the same voltage, the sample with x = 0.6 mol% exemplifies conspicuous switched domains ((d)). The temperature dependence of the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 is essential for the practical use of piezoelectric devices. Therefore, we tested the temperature stability of d 33 through both in situ and ex situ measurements. The thermal stability of the piezoelectric coefficient is quantitatively described by the ratio d 33T /d 33RT , where d 33T is the piezoelectric coefficient at the corresponding temperature T, and d 33RT is the piezoelectric coefficient at RT. (a) depicts the ex situ temperature stability of PYN\u2013PHT, PYN\u2013PHT\u20130.6Ta, PZT-5, and PZT-8 ceramics across a range of temperatures: 25 \xb0C, 50 \xb0C, 100 \xb0C, 150 \xb0C, 200 \xb0C, 250 \xb0C, and 300 \xb0C. The results indicate that the d 33T /d 33RT values of PZT-5 and PZT-8 ceramics significantly decrease above 100 \xb0C. By contrast, the d 33 values of PYN\u2013PHT and PYN\u2013PHT\u20130.6Ta vary by only 6.43 % and 6.03 %, respectively, from 25 \xb0C to 300 \xb0C. (b) clearly shows that the curve of the PYN\u2013PHT\u2013xTa ceramics is significantly higher than that of PYN\u2013PHT under real-time d 33 testing. The d33 of the blue line exhibits an increasing trend, which may be due to the ceramic being exposed to a high-temperature environment during the experiment, leading to an enhancement in d 33. No significant depolarization behavior was observed in the PYN\u2013PHT\u2013xTa ceramics at temperatures lower than 300 \xb0C. Furthermore, after PYN\u2013PHT\u20130.6Ta was held at 300 \xb0C for 24 h, its d 33 value decreased by only 4 %, as shown in (c).

# INTRODUCTION
During the drilling process, probe sensors must collect data on the pressure and temperature of the surrounding environment, with operating temperatures reaching 200 \xb0C and potentially more with increasing depth. In the automotive sector, components such as dynamic fuel injection nozzles and vibration sensors need to operate at temperatures up to 300 \xb0C. The PYN\u2013PHT perovskite-type ceramics, comprising Pb(Yb0.5Nb0.5)O3 (PYN) and Pb(Hf1\u2212xTix)O3 (PHT), is recognized as an outstanding candidate for applications involving high-temperature piezoelectricity. Zhang et al. demonstrated that the addition of lithium fluoride effectively reduces the sintering temperature of PYN\u2013PHT ceramics and improves their piezoelectric performance. Shi et al. prepared PIN\u2013PHT\u20131.2Sb ceramics exhibiting good thermal stability within the temperature range of 25 \xb0C\u2013285 \xb0C. However, at 285 \xb0C, the d 33 value was found to be sharply reduced. It is worth mentioning that PYN\u2013PHT ceramics are more economical in terms of raw materials than PYN\u2013PHT single crystal. However, research on the temperature stability of PYN\u2013PHT ceramics is very limited. Given the excellent intrinsic properties of 0.1PYN\u20130.9PHT ceramics, these ceramics were selected for investigation in this study, with the aim to improve their piezoelectric performance and stability at elevated temperatures. Methods to improve the piezoelectric response of piezoelectric ceramics mainly include creating relaxor ferroelectrics , enhancing local structural heterogeneity, and constructing morphotropic phase boundaries (MPBs). Song et al. successfully synthesized Sm-doped Pb(Mg,Nb)O3\u2013PbTiO3 (Sm\u2013PMN\u2013PT) ceramics with a high piezoelectric coefficient (up to 1500 pC/N) by introducing local heterogeneous structures to manipulate the interfacial energy and alter the average free-energy landscape of the material. Qiao et al. significantly enhanced the piezoelectric response of PIN\u2013PHT ceramics by co-doping them with SbE^{5+} (donor) and NdE^{3+} (acceptor) ions, effectively adjusting the defect concentration and local structure of the ceramic. Designing MPBs has long been one of the most popular methods for achieving high piezoelectric performance in piezoelectric materials. Yan et al. found that BZT\u2013PT ceramics with R3m/P4mm MPB exhibit strong piezoelectricity with d 33 = 500 pC/N. On the basis of thermodynamic theory, the dielectric constant is linked to the curvature of the free-energy density distribution concerning polarization (\u2202GE^{2}/\u2202PE^{2}). A low curvature or a flat energy distribution corresponds to a high dielectric constant \u03b5, which in turn leads to a high piezoelectric coefficient d 33. It is impossible to attain a perfectly flat energy distribution at the MPB compositions because the composition-induced ferroelectric phase transition is inherently first-order. In this work, we carefully combined the characteristics of the tetragonal phase and local structural heterogeneity, proposing an alternative strategy to enhance piezoelectric performance and temperature stability of PYN\u2013PHT piezoelectric ceramics. Specifically, these ceramics were doped with heterovalent TaE^{5+} ions, which permits to maintain the tetragonal phase and enhance the relaxor properties of the system. This study aims to achieve elevated working temperatures of PYN-PHT ceramics without compromising d 33 values. A comprehensive investigation was undertaken to explore the correlation between the microdomain and the macroscopic electrical properties of PYN\u2013PHT-xmol%Ta ceramics. Our results provide a basis to improve the performance of PYN\u2013PHT ceramics.

# CONCLUSION
In summary, we have successfully fabricated dense ceramics with reliable temperature stability and high Curie temperature within the PYN-PHT ceramic system through a meticulously designed "softening" chemical doping approach. The deliberate introduction of TaE^{5+} ions had the vital effect of flattening the free energy landscape, a primary factor in realizing special material properties. Notably, the PYN-PHT-0.6Ta, featuring the relaxor ferroelectric characteristics, has experienced extensive improvement, leading to an impressive d 33 value of 560 pC/N, T C of 312.2 \xb0C and an elevated k p value reaching 0.7. Direct in-situ piezoelectric measurement has revealed the real-time changes of d 33 and offered insight into the actual depolarization temperature. Our compelling findings clarify that the sample with x = 0.6 mol% composition retains 96 % of its d 33 when subjected to a condition of 300 \xb0C for 24 h. The Ta2O5-modified PYN-PHT system's exceptional piezoelectric performance, combined with its extended operational temperature range, highlights its critical role in propelling the development of advancing piezoelectric applications.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
To verify this, specific local structures and tetragonal phases were used to manipulate the free-energy distribution in the prepared PYN\u2013PHT\u2013Ta ceramics in different ways, providing a "deep and flat" free-energy landscape. Traditional ferroelectric systems are usually characterized by long-range-ordered domain structures, whereas relaxor ferroelectrics are characterized by local structures that are inhomogeneous on the nanoscale, which gives rise to the presence of numerous polar nanoregions (PNRs). Previous studies have shown that introducing cations at the B-sites of PYN\u2013PHT ceramics can provide a high level of charge inhomogeneity, thereby resulting in strong relaxor behavior. Moreover, the lattice is almost entirely composed of tetragonal phases exhibiting significant anisotropy, which helps to form a deep energy landscape as well as an enhanced \u0394G. As far as we are aware, such a microstructure within the PYN-PHT system has not previously been identified in any ceramics possessing an ultrahigh piezoelectric coefficient. The PYN\u2013PHT system features highly dispersed local inhomogeneous structures, small domain sizes, and high domain density, which results in the creation of a flat potential landscape. Here, we propose a design strategy for PYN\u2013PHT\u2013xTa based on doping, which endows them with a "mixed-state" structure featuring the coexistence large and small domains. In summary, this strategy provides a novel approach to tailor the structure and performance of piezoelectric materials (see ). shows the XRD patterns of PYN\u2013PHT\u2013xTa piezoelectric ceramics in the angular range of 10\xb0\u201380\xb0. The patterns reveal the presence of the ABO3 perovskite structure with no additional impurity peaks. This confirms that TaE^{5+} ions were effectively incorporated into the PYN\u2013PHT lattice, forming a homogeneous solid solution. For further analysis, a local magnification of the 42\xb0\u201346\xb0 range was performed, which shows the presence of a distinct split in the (200) and (002) diffraction peaks, signifying that the phase structure of the six ceramic samples is predominantly tetragonal. Based on the principle of similar ionic radius, TaE^{5+} ions (0.64 \xc5) should replace TiE^{4+} ions (0.61 \xc5), resulting in donor doping. The refinement curves and experimental curves for each component match well, with wR% and GOF values within acceptable ranges, demonstrating the accuracy of the refinement results. The results show that with the addition of TaE^{5+} dopant ions, the lattice constants change and the structure exhibits a single tetragonal phase. The c/a ratios of 1.020, 1.023, 1.022, 1.017, 1.021, and 1.021 for x ranging from 0 to 1.5 mol% indicate a slight lattice distortion of the tetragonal unit cell, which affects polarization reversal and domain switching, enhancing the piezoelectric properties of the PYN\u2013PHT\u2013xTa ceramics. To examine the inherent effect of grain size on the piezoelectric response of the ceramics, (a)\u2013(f) illustrate the microstructure of six ceramic groups (with different x) sintered at 1175 \xb0C. Using the ImageJ software and the line-intercept method, the average grain size (AGS) was calculated for 50 selected grains. The results indicate that the AGSs are 4.07, 3.18, 2.61, 2.56, 1.95, and 1.89 \u03bcm for x = 0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, and 1.5 mol%, respectively. The AGS decreases with increasing x, which is likely due to the fact that TaE^{5+} doping can create cation vacancies at the grain boundaries. TaE^{5+} ion doping significantly alters the microstructural characteristics of the ceramics. Overall, all six samples exhibit dense microstructures and no holes or disintegration. (g) and (h) show the variation in piezoelectric constant(d 33), bulk density(\u03c1 1 ), relative density(\u03c1 2 ) and electromechanical coupling factor (k p ) with x. From (g), it can be seen that the \u03c1(\u03c1 1, \u03c1 2 ) and d 33 of the PYN\u2013PHT\u2013xTa ceramics initially increase with increasing x and then gradually decrease when x > 0.6. The d 33 value increases from 448 to 560 pC/N, and the \u03c1 reaches a maximum value of 8.82 g/cm\xb3 at x = 0.6. Here, the kp of PYN\u2013PHT\u2013xTa ceramics is positively correlated with their d 33 , as depicted in (h). At a doping level of 0.6 mol%, k p reaches a peak of 0.7. The increase in the number of lead vacancies caused by Ta2O5 doping is the primary reason for the enhancement of k p. shows the EDS spectra of the PYN\u2013PHT\u20130.6Ta sample, which reveals that each element is uniformly distributed within the grains without any aggregation at grain boundaries, ensuring excellent piezoelectric performance. (b) displays the percentage of each element in the ceramic, which is consistent with the stoichiometric ratio of the PYN\u2013PHT\u20130.6Ta system. However, due to the volatility of Pb, a small amount of Pb is inevitably lost during high-temperature sintering, resulting in slightly lower Pb content than the theoretical value.  (a) provides the variation of the relative permittivity (\u025b r ) of PYN\u2013PHT\u2013xTa ceramics with temperature. The curves of all ceramic samples exhibit similar trends, with the relative permittivity showing a single\u2013peak model, reaching the maximum value at the Curie temperature (T C ). A single dielectric peak is present in the temperature range from room temperature (RT) to 500 \xb0C, indicating that no other phase transitions occur and demonstrating a strong thermal stability of the ceramics. For relaxor ferroelectrics, the relationship between permittivity and temperature is fitted using the Curie\u2013Weiss law (also known as the Uchino and Nomura equation) : where C denotes the Curie constant, and \u03b3 is the dispersion factor (1 < \u03b3 < 2), which corresponds to the slope of the line fitting the ln(1/\u025b \u2013 1/\u025b max ) vs. ln(T \u2212 T max) curve. (b) shows the \u03b3 values of PYN\u2013PHT\u2013xTa ceramics. When \u03b3 approaches 1, the ceramics exhibit characteristics of classical ferroelectric materials, whereas when \u03b3 approaches 2, they exhibit characteristics of disordered relaxor ferroelectrics. \u025b r and \u025b max denote the permittivity of the sample at temperatures T and T max, respectively. Specifically, as x increases from 0 to 0.3 mol% and then to 0.6 mol%, \u03b3 increases from 1.52 to 1.61 and then to 1.77, respectively. For x = 0.9, 1.2, and 1.5 mol%, the \u03b3 values are 1.61, 1.58, and 1.60, respectively. The sample with x = 0.6 mol% exhibits the strongest dielectric relaxation. Both the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 and \u03b3 attain their peak values when x is 0.6 mol%, which endows the corresponding ceramic with enhanced relaxor characteristics. This is a key factor contributing to their improved piezoelectric response. (c) illustrates the dielectric characteristics of the PYN\u2013PHT\u2013xTa ceramic system. It's important to highlight that, despite modest reductions, the Curie temperature (T C ) of all samples maintains a significant level of stability, ranging from 312.2 \xb0C to 321.4 \xb0C. It can be observed that the relative dielectric constant (\u03b5) and the dielectric loss tangent (tan\u03b4) are inversely related. The tan\u03b4 first decreases and then increases with the increase in x. The \u03b5 can be easily controlled in perovskite ferroelectrics systems: An increase in d 33 is usually associated with an increase in dielectric constant. Therefore, for the sample with x = 0.6 mol%, the maximum \u03b5 r is 1998.67 and the minimum tan\u03b4 is 0.0208. (a)\u2013(f) illustrate how the reciprocal of the dielectric constant varies with temperature for PYN\u2013PHT\u2013xTa ceramics at a frequency of 1 kHz. T B is the critical temperature for the emergence of polar nanoregions (PNRs). Diffuseness is emblematic of relaxor ferroelectric behavior, and T m indicates the temperature at which the dielectric constant attains its apex, denoted as \u03b5 max. The relaxor behavior of PYN\u2013PHT\u2013xTa ceramics is explained by \u0394T = T B \u2212 T m. The larger the \u0394T value, the stronger the relaxor behavior. For lead-based relaxors, it is generally acknowledged that dielectric relaxation is closely related to the appearance of PNRs. As shown in (a)\u2013(f), with the increase in x, this ternary system exhibits enhanced relaxor behavior, which is consistent with the results (\u03b3) in (c). The enhanced relaxor behavior can also explain the incorporation of TaE^{5+} ions introduces B-site charged defects, which create a random internal field, disrupting the long-range order, which results in improved piezoelectricity. The P\u2013E loops of PYN\u2013PHT\u2013xTa ceramics are illustrated in (a). All PYN\u2013PHT samples exhibit well-fined square P\u2013E hysteresis loops, indicating their excellent ferroelectric properties. P r and E c exhibit opposite trends; P r reaches the maximum value (50.58 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}) as x increases up to 1.2 mol%. The E c of the ceramic samples decreases from 11.33 kV/cm for the pristine (x = 0 mol%) to 10.15 kV/cm for the sample (x = 0.6 mol%). The variation in E c is related to the increased mobility of the ferroelectric domains due to the introduction of high-valent TaE^{5+} ions, which is also one of the reasons for the enhancement of the remanent polarization. (c) illustrates the S\u2013E curves of the PYN\u2013PHT ceramics doped with various amounts of Ta2O5. The sample with 0.6 mol% Ta exhibits the maximal electrostrain value (0.156 %) measured under maximal electric field of 30 kV/cm. (d) shows the relationship between d 33 and \u025b r P r , which is expressed by the following equation: where Q represents the electrostrictive coefficient. Based on thermodynamic theory, d 33 is proportional to the product of P r and \u025b r. As shown in the figure, d 33 and \u025b r P r exhibit the same trend. To delve into the high piezoelectric performance of PYN\u2013PHT\u2013xTa ceramics, the Rayleigh analysis method was employed to explain the intrinsic and extrinsic contributions, which can be expressed as follows : where S(E) represents the strain induced by the electric field, E 0 is the magnitude of the external electric field, d init represents the intrinsic contribution (polarization rotation), and \u03b1E 0 is the extrinsic contribution (phase transition and irreversible domain wall motion). To avoid domain wall switching, Rayleigh analysis was investigated under a small electric field (E 0), with E 0 \u226a E c. As shown in (a), the correlation between the inverse piezoelectric coefficient and the electric field E 0 can be accurately represented by a linear fit. This indicates that the Rayleigh law applies to the PYN\u2013PHT\u2013xTa system. (b) depicts that both \u03b1 and d init follow a similar trend, initially rising with the increase in x, peaking at their highest values when x equals 0.6 mol% (2.52 \xd7 10E^{\u221216} mE^{2}/VE^{2} and 403 p.m./V, respectively), and subsequently declining. The excellent piezoelectric performance of the ceramic with x = 0.6 mol% is attributed to the synergistic contribution of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Similar phenomena have been previously reported in PZ\u2013PT\u2013BNT  and PNN\u2013PIN\u2013PT  ceramics. Here, the local piezoresponse and mesoscopic domain structures was investigated through piezoelectric force microscope (PFM). (a) and (b) reveal that the ceramic with x = 0 mol% exhibits large domains. Inversely, for x = 0.6 mol%, island domain configurations characterized by distinct contracts are displayed configurations within 5 \xd7 5 \u03bcmE^{2} region. Additionally, in comparison to the B-site atoms in the original perovskite structure, doping with TaE^{5+} ions inevitably introduces differences in valence state, ionic radius, and electronegativity, distorting the perovskite structure. Thus, the presence of nanodomains in the PYN\u2013PHT\u20130.6Ta sample promotes polarization rotation, flattening the Gibbs free-energy distribution and thereby generating a higher piezoelectric activity. To gain deeper insight into domain change behavior under an electric field for the samples with x = 0 and 0.6 mol%, we wrote domains in these ceramics at RT using the \u201cLitho\u201d mode of PFM, as shown in (c) and (d). For a given DC voltage, the degree of domain switching differs between the two samples. For the sample with x = 0 mol%, due to its long-range-ordered ferroelectric domains, only partial switching occurs under a +10 V voltage ((c)). By contrast, under the same voltage, the sample with x = 0.6 mol% exemplifies conspicuous switched domains ((d)). The temperature dependence of the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 is essential for the practical use of piezoelectric devices. Therefore, we tested the temperature stability of d 33 through both in situ and ex situ measurements. The thermal stability of the piezoelectric coefficient is quantitatively described by the ratio d 33T /d 33RT , where d 33T is the piezoelectric coefficient at the corresponding temperature T, and d 33RT is the piezoelectric coefficient at RT. (a) depicts the ex situ temperature stability of PYN\u2013PHT, PYN\u2013PHT\u20130.6Ta, PZT-5, and PZT-8 ceramics across a range of temperatures: 25 \xb0C, 50 \xb0C, 100 \xb0C, 150 \xb0C, 200 \xb0C, 250 \xb0C, and 300 \xb0C. The results indicate that the d 33T /d 33RT values of PZT-5 and PZT-8 ceramics significantly decrease above 100 \xb0C. By contrast, the d 33 values of PYN\u2013PHT and PYN\u2013PHT\u20130.6Ta vary by only 6.43 % and 6.03 %, respectively, from 25 \xb0C to 300 \xb0C. (b) clearly shows that the curve of the PYN\u2013PHT\u2013xTa ceramics is significantly higher than that of PYN\u2013PHT under real-time d 33 testing. The d33 of the blue line exhibits an increasing trend, which may be due to the ceramic being exposed to a high-temperature environment during the experiment, leading to an enhancement in d 33. No significant depolarization behavior was observed in the PYN\u2013PHT\u2013xTa ceramics at temperatures lower than 300 \xb0C. Furthermore, after PYN\u2013PHT\u20130.6Ta was held at 300 \xb0C for 24 h, its d 33 value decreased by only 4 %, as shown in (c).

# INTRODUCTION
During the drilling process, probe sensors must collect data on the pressure and temperature of the surrounding environment, with operating temperatures reaching 200 \xb0C and potentially more with increasing depth. In the automotive sector, components such as dynamic fuel injection nozzles and vibration sensors need to operate at temperatures up to 300 \xb0C. The PYN\u2013PHT perovskite-type ceramics, comprising Pb(Yb0.5Nb0.5)O3 (PYN) and Pb(Hf1\u2212xTix)O3 (PHT), is recognized as an outstanding candidate for applications involving high-temperature piezoelectricity. Zhang et al. demonstrated that the addition of lithium fluoride effectively reduces the sintering temperature of PYN\u2013PHT ceramics and improves their piezoelectric performance. Shi et al. prepared PIN\u2013PHT\u20131.2Sb ceramics exhibiting good thermal stability within the temperature range of 25 \xb0C\u2013285 \xb0C. However, at 285 \xb0C, the d 33 value was found to be sharply reduced. It is worth mentioning that PYN\u2013PHT ceramics are more economical in terms of raw materials than PYN\u2013PHT single crystal. However, research on the temperature stability of PYN\u2013PHT ceramics is very limited. Given the excellent intrinsic properties of 0.1PYN\u20130.9PHT ceramics, these ceramics were selected for investigation in this study, with the aim to improve their piezoelectric performance and stability at elevated temperatures. Methods to improve the piezoelectric response of piezoelectric ceramics mainly include creating relaxor ferroelectrics , enhancing local structural heterogeneity, and constructing morphotropic phase boundaries (MPBs). Song et al. successfully synthesized Sm-doped Pb(Mg,Nb)O3\u2013PbTiO3 (Sm\u2013PMN\u2013PT) ceramics with a high piezoelectric coefficient (up to 1500 pC/N) by introducing local heterogeneous structures to manipulate the interfacial energy and alter the average free-energy landscape of the material. Qiao et al. significantly enhanced the piezoelectric response of PIN\u2013PHT ceramics by co-doping them with SbE^{5+} (donor) and NdE^{3+} (acceptor) ions, effectively adjusting the defect concentration and local structure of the ceramic. Designing MPBs has long been one of the most popular methods for achieving high piezoelectric performance in piezoelectric materials. Yan et al. found that BZT\u2013PT ceramics with R3m/P4mm MPB exhibit strong piezoelectricity with d 33 = 500 pC/N. On the basis of thermodynamic theory, the dielectric constant is linked to the curvature of the free-energy density distribution concerning polarization (\u2202GE^{2}/\u2202PE^{2}). A low curvature or a flat energy distribution corresponds to a high dielectric constant \u03b5, which in turn leads to a high piezoelectric coefficient d 33. It is impossible to attain a perfectly flat energy distribution at the MPB compositions because the composition-induced ferroelectric phase transition is inherently first-order. In this work, we carefully combined the characteristics of the tetragonal phase and local structural heterogeneity, proposing an alternative strategy to enhance piezoelectric performance and temperature stability of PYN\u2013PHT piezoelectric ceramics. Specifically, these ceramics were doped with heterovalent TaE^{5+} ions, which permits to maintain the tetragonal phase and enhance the relaxor properties of the system. This study aims to achieve elevated working temperatures of PYN-PHT ceramics without compromising d 33 values. A comprehensive investigation was undertaken to explore the correlation between the microdomain and the macroscopic electrical properties of PYN\u2013PHT-xmol%Ta ceramics. Our results provide a basis to improve the performance of PYN\u2013PHT ceramics.

# CONCLUSION
In summary, we have successfully fabricated dense ceramics with reliable temperature stability and high Curie temperature within the PYN-PHT ceramic system through a meticulously designed "softening" chemical doping approach. The deliberate introduction of TaE^{5+} ions had the vital effect of flattening the free energy landscape, a primary factor in realizing special material properties. Notably, the PYN-PHT-0.6Ta, featuring the relaxor ferroelectric characteristics, has experienced extensive improvement, leading to an impressive d 33 value of 560 pC/N, T C of 312.2 \xb0C and an elevated k p value reaching 0.7. Direct in-situ piezoelectric measurement has revealed the real-time changes of d 33 and offered insight into the actual depolarization temperature. Our compelling findings clarify that the sample with x = 0.6 mol% composition retains 96 % of its d 33 when subjected to a condition of 300 \xb0C for 24 h. The Ta2O5-modified PYN-PHT system's exceptional piezoelectric performance, combined with its extended operational temperature range, highlights its critical role in propelling the development of advancing piezoelectric applications.
