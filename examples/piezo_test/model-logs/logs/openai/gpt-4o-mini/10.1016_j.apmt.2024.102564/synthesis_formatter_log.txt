Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'Spin-coating', 'precursors': ['L-phenylalanyl-L-leucine', 'L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine', 'Methanol'], 'steps': ['Prepare a dipeptide solution in methanol (1 mg/mL).', 'Drop 10 µL of the solution on a silicon substrate.', 'Remove the solvent by spontaneous evaporation, forced drying with warm air, or spin-coating at 3000 rpm.', 'Seal the Petri dish containing the substrate to create saturated vapor and keep it for 10 minutes to 24 hours.', 'Dry the film with warm air at 45°C.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRPD', 'Raman Spectroscopy', 'AFM', 'PFM']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
