In this study, the multidoped KNN compositions with the measured d 33 values were collected from the published literature and unpublished laboratory records  (see in the Supplementary Material). Their chemical formulas were standardised as (1\u2212x)(K y1 Na y2 Li1\u2212y1\u2212y2 )(Nb z Sb 1\u2212z )O3-xMZrO3 (xM = aBa, bCa, cBi0.5K0.5, dBi0.5Na0.5 or eBi0.5Li0.5). All samples in the database were prepared using the conventional solid-state reaction method to ensure data consistency and avoid any influence from different preparation methods on the ML models. The sintering temperature for the samples was approximately 1120 \xb0C. The search space was generated by controlling the precision of the mole fractions to 0.01. The mole fraction of each variable was constrained by 0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.06, 0.4 \u2264 y 1 \u2264 0.5, 0.5 \u2264 y 2 \u2264 0.6, 0.9 \u2264 z \u2264 1 and 0 \u2264 a, b, c, d, e \u2264 0.05 to prevent possible relaxor phase transitions that could impede d 33 enhancement in the KNN-based system. To improve the interpretation and generalisability of the ML models, the input data were transformed from chemical elements into a set of features. In addition, we designed and incorporated additional features based on the domain knowledge of KNN-based materials. The construction of additional features aimed to further reinforce the interpretability and performance of the ML model. The additional features involved the influence of dopants on phase transition temperatures  and K/Na ratio , which have been identified as relevant to the piezoelectricity of KNN materials. (see in the Supplementary Material). Based on the constructed features, we used Pearson correlation analysis and a gradient-boosted feature selection method  to screen suitable features for the ML models. The Pearson correlation coefficient r between two features is defined as follows: where n is the number of features, x i and y i are two different features and x\u203e and y\u203e are the means of x i and y i , respectively. Features with high correlation (r \u2265 0.95) were grouped, and only the first feature from each group was retained. ML models are used to establish the relationship between the input material features x and the output material properties y , which can be expressed as y = f( x ). In this study, the d 33 was the target property to be fitted. The ML model involved a large pool of regression models, with the data divided into training, validation, and testing sets. The performances of different ML regression algorithms, including support vector machine regression with linear (SVR_l), polynomial (SVR_p), radial basis (SVR_r) function kernels, as well as decision tree regression (DTR), random forest regression (RFR) and ridge regression (RR) , were evaluated. The features were ranked by their relative importance to validate the ML models. To ensure consistency and fairness during comparison, the hyperparameters of the ML models (listed in , Supplementary Material) were optimised using a grid search method, which evaluates the performance metrics of the models across all possible hyperparameter combinations. The k-fold cross-validation (CV) method was applied to evaluate model performance, which is defined as follows: where k is the number of CV folds and RMSE is the root mean square error between the inverse-standardised true (Y i ) and predicted ( Yi\u02c6) values. When k equals the data sample size, it is known as leave-one-out CV (LOOCV). The RMSE calculated using LOOCV (CV_RMSE) was used as the performance metric for comparing the ML algorithm. The ML algorithm with the lowest error was selected for subsequent regression. The data were divided into training/validation and test sets to assess the predictive and generalisation abilities of the chosen ML algorithm with varying number of features. The split ratio was 4:1 for training/validation and testing. Performance metrics, including RMSE and R E^{2}, were calculated for both the training/validation and test sets. Finally, the selected ML algorithm with appropriate input features was applied to the entire database. This study used the cyclic surrogate-based optimisation method  to design the composition of KNN-based ceramics because of its ability to guide sample-efficient exploitation and the exploration of novel materials in the most promising areas of the search space. The validated ML model was used as the surrogate model. We used two typical utility functions as search strategies in surrogate-based optimisation: exploitation (ET) and expected improvement (EI). ET and EI values at point x are provided in. The ET criterion selects the composition with the highest predicted mean \u03bc, as determined by the ML models, without accounting for model uncertainties. In contrast, the EI criterion balances exploitation and exploration by identifying compositions that improve upon f( x \u2217), which is the highest observed d 33 value in the database. The first component of EI can be increased by increasing \u03bc, whereas the second component can be improved by increasing the uncertainty-associated standard deviation \u03c3. Assuming y( x ) \u223c N(\u03bc, \u03c3 E^{ }), \u03a6(z) and \u03c6(z) denote the cumulative distribution function and probability density function of the standard normal distribution, respectively. The bootstrap resampling method was used to account for \u03bc and \u03c3. By randomly resampling with replacement from the original dataset, we generated 500 datasets to train 500 ML models, generating 500 predictions for each possible composition in the search space. In this study, we conducted multiple iterations to optimise the d 33 values of the KNN-based ceramics, a process commonly referred to as active learning or adaptive design. The d 33 values of the synthesised samples were measured and added to the dataset for subsequent model training and prediction. The KNN-based piezoceramics were prepared using the conventional solid-state method. The analytical reagents of K2CO3, Na2CO3, LiCO3, Nb2O5, Sb2O3, ZrO2, Bi2O3, CaCO3 and BaCO3 (purity \u226599.0 %) were used as raw materials. These materials were mixed in stoichiometric ratios by ball milling with alcohol as a solvent for 12 h. The prepared powders were dried and calcined at 900 \xb0C. The pellets were fired at 600 \xb0C to remove the binder and subsequently sintered at 1070\xb0C-1170 \xb0C for 6 h under an ambient atmosphere. The optimal sintered specimen with the highest d 33 was taken as the final result. The ceramic surfaces were polished and thermally etched to expose the microstructure and grain morphologies, which were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Vega 3, TESCAN, Czech). The ferroelectric and electromechanical properties were characterised at 10 Hz and room temperature using a precision ferroelectric workstation (Radiant Technologies, Inc., USA) equipped with a photonic sensor (MTI-2100, MEMS Technology, USA). The d 33 of the ceramic specimens, which were poled in silicone oil at 4 kV/mm, was measured using a quasi-static piezo-d 33 meter (ZJ-3A, Institute of Acoustics, Academia Sinica, China).

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A high d 33 is expected for chemically modified KNN ceramics that form the R-T phase boundaries similar to the morphotropic phase boundary observed in classical PZT-based piezoelectric materials. Therefore, we applied feature engineering techniques to statistically analyse the effects of different dopants on the d 33 of KNN-based ceramics. The features in the feature pool were divided into six categories: 1) size factors, such as atomic volume (V), valence electron distance (RDVE) and core electron distance (RDCE); 2) electrochemical factors, such as EN-P, Matyonov-Batsanov electronegativity (EN-MB) and EA; 3) atomic number factors, such as atomic number (AN), Clementi effective nuclear charge (EFF-C) and Slater effective nuclear charge (EFF-S); 4) bond parameter factors, such as polarisability (P) and the ratio of valence electron number to nominal charge (Vec/Z); 5) unique factors, such as tolerance factor (t) and octahedral factor (u) and 6) additional factors, such as the K/Na ratio and influence of doping element on the R-O phase transition temperature (T R_O ). Those features meet the rational criteria of material features , which are 1) representative to the material, 2) sensitive to the target property and 3) easy to obtain. In total, 31 features were prepared for selection. shows the Pearson correlation heatmap, which illustrates the correlation matrix of the features. Features with r > 0.95 were considered redundant in the ML models. For example, t was retained while R, AO, CVW, RCOV and EVW were excluded. Thus, the number of features was reduced to 20. We analysed the contribution of each remaining feature to predict d 33 using the gradient-boosted method. shows the top 10 features ranked by their importance in describing d 33. Features with lower importance scores contributed less to the prediction of d 33 than features with higher scores. The phase transition temperature features were identified as important from the ML perspective. This result can be explained by the fact that the K/Na ratio can not generally reflect the impact of dopants on d 33. Different K/Na can implicate the same high d 33  in the view of the ML model, making it difficult for the model to learn the d 33 pattern based on the undetermined stoichiometry of dopants. As a result, the K/Na has not been marked with high importance from the aspect of the ML algorithm. At this stage, we developed precise predictive ML models for predicting d 33 based on selected features. The most appropriate ML model type was first selected. As shown in a, the SVR_r model achieved the lowest RMSE when the number of features exceeded three. The comparison between SVR_l, SVR_p and SVR_r highlighted the advantage of the radial basis function kernel in handling nonlinearly separable data, thereby outperforming both the polynomial and linear function kernels. Although the RR and SVR_l models performed similarly owing to their linear nature, the RFR model, despite performing well with less than three features, did not match the performance of the SVR_r model with high-dimensional input data. Overall, the SVR_r model demonstrated robust performance for up to eight features, making it the preferred choice for this study owing to its superior performance compared to other ML algorithms. This result confirmed the advantage of SVR_r in predicting the d 33 values of piezoceramics. To evaluate the SVR_r model for previously unobserved data, we extracted 20 % of the data from the database as a test set. b illustrates the variation in the performance of the SVR_r model validated by a 10-fold CV with an increasing number of input features. For both the training/validation and test sets, a noticeable decrease in RMSE and an increase in R E^{ } for up to five features were observed. This tendency demonstrated the ML process from underfitting to overfitting. Based on Occam's razor principle, we selected the feature tuples \u2018W, D, EN-P, EA, T c \u2019 for further validation of the SVR_r model. The selected EN-P and D features are closely related to the features identified as important and general to ferroelectric materials. The EN-P and previously identified Matyonov-Batsanov electronegativity both reflect electronegativity. However, the features eventually used for ML modelling can vary according to specific material systems and target properties. In this case study, the EN-P, D united with W, EA and T c were selected to describe the d 33 value of multidoped KNN-based piezoceramics based on the model evaluation result. The hyperparameter optimisation process of the SVR_r model with the five-tuple features is shown in c. In the SVR_r model, the hyperparameter C acted as a regularisation parameter that controlled the degree of penalty for estimation errors. The hyperparameter \u03b3 determines the extent to which a single training point influences the decision boundary. A larger \u03b3 causes the decision boundary to be more easily affected by points close to it, potentially resulting in a more complex decision boundary that may also overfit the training data. During the grid search process, C was varied from 0 to 10 in increments of 0.2, whereas \u03b3 was varied from 0.1 to 5 in increments of 0.1. The results indicate that the SVR_r model with \u03b3 < 2 and C < 4 exhibited relatively good performance based on the KNN database. In conclusion, excessive feature numbers and hyperparameters that overly complicate the model can lead to overfitting, which decreases model performance. d illustrates the regression and generalisation performance of the SVR_r model with the five-tuple features. In this study, most predicted d 33 values approximately matched the measured values in both the training and test sets. Notably, the ML models tended to \u2018overestimate\u2019 the points when their d 33 was <300 pC/N and \u2018underestimate\u2019 the points when their d 33 was >300 pC/N. A similar phenomenon was reported in a study on BT-based piezoceramics. For points with d 33 values < 300 pC/N, the deviation was likely owing to the high sensitivity of the KNN-based ceramics to sintering conditions. Slight variation in the optimal sintering temperature and duration can lead to significant decrease in d 33. Conversely, for points with d 33 > 300 pC/N, the compositions may be near the polymorphic phase boundary (PPB) in KNN-based ceramics. Compositions near the PPB often exhibit significant d 33 improvements, making them appear as \u2018singular points\u2019 in the dataset. Consequently, the ML model suppressed the predicted d 33 for compositions near PPB and increased the predicted d 33 for compositions far from PPB to balance the prediction accuracy. We believe that identifying the specific features that characterise the PPB in KNN-based ceramics can potentially enhance the model performance. lists the LOOCV errors of the SVR_r model with the five input features. The CV error scale in this study was consistent with those observed in other lead-free systems. The lower errors obtained in this study can be attributed to the process of data standardisation during the ML modelling. When the observed data size is significantly smaller than the material design space, the pure exploitation ET function may easily get stuck in local optima because it does not account for model uncertainty during the search process. The EI function is a valuable tool for identifying global optima because it balances \u03bc and \u03c3. To obtain \u03bc and \u03c3, we trained 500 ML models on 500 datasets generated via the bootstrapping resampling method in this study. Because prediction variance was a key factor in using the EI in this study, the size of the bootstrapped dataset was kept relatively small, identical to the size of the original dataset. After bootstrapping, we trained and deployed ML models across the entire search space to obtain predicted distributions. We added an approximate \u2018bell curve\u2019 of the Gaussian distribution to represent the predicted d 33 distribution of the candidate compositions suggested by the ET and EI functions. The graph shows that the pure ET function identified compounds that were expected to perform well, with high predicted d 33 values located in a narrow range. In contrast, the EI function favoured exploring compositions with relatively higher uncertainties, resulting in predicted d 33 values spanning a broader range than those selected by the ET function. Finally, we conducted three iterations of the active learning loop to validate the proposed methods. d presents the model performance metrics RMSE and R E^{ } for the three experimental iterations. Although the ML performance remained stable on the training sets, it fluctuated on the test sets as the number of iterations increased. The \u2018singular points\u2019 that were randomly distributed between the training and test sets significantly influenced the performance metrics of the ML model. Increasing the number of iterations to expand the database can facilitate obtaining more stable performance metrics. presents the predicted and measured d 33 values for the selected compositions for each iteration. The predicted d 33 comprises the integer components of \u03bc and \u03c3 from 500 predictions generated by the ML models. For all six samples, the disparities between the predicted and measured d 33 values were not significant, demonstrating the excellent predictive capability of the ML models. The largest error of 22 % was observed for Comp4, which was suggested by the EI function in the second iteration. The inconsistencies between the predicted and measured d 33 values may be due to the small database size, which affects the predictions, or variations in sample quality that affect the measured values. Comparisons between the ET and EI functions revealed that the ET function outperformed the exploitation-exploration trade-off EI function in identifying KNN compositions with enhanced d 33, at least for the first three iterations. This result is consistent with a previous study on BT-based ceramics that also focused on the same target property d 33. However, the EI function may outperform ET in other cases, such as when searching for BT-based ceramics with enhanced electrostrains. Two factors likely explain the better performance of ET in this case study: 1) the EI function favoured exploration over exploitation, and the risks associated with exploration did not initially result in exceptional piezoelectricity in the KNN system, and 2) KNN-based ceramics are highly sensitive to compositional variations. A possible approach to emphasise or suppress the effect of exploration is to introduce a parameter \u03be into the EI formula to balance exploitation and exploration. Nevertheless, we believe that the EI function is necessary for optimising the d 33 value of KNN ceramics because it reduces uncertainties in ML models by searching for compositions with high predicted variance. In this study, all synthesised KNN-based ceramics exhibited relatively dense microstructures with an average grain size of 1\u20135 \u03bcm ( ). The SEM analysis indicated no significant differences in microstructures between the ceramics designed by ET and EI functions, suggesting the exclusion of the effects of the preparation methods on the different ceramics. shows the P-E hysteresis loops (a), the bipolar S-E curves (b) and the unipolar S-E curves (c), measured at a frequency of 10 Hz and room temperature for the KNN ceramics. The three compositions selected by ET demonstrated strong ferroelectricity, with P r values exceeding 20 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}. As shown in c (solid lines), the three compositions selected by ET exhibited a large electric field-induced strain exceeding 0.14 % at 30 kV/cm, corresponding to the high-field piezoelectric strain coefficient (d 33\u2217) of >476 p.m./V. The highest d 33\u2217 value of 537 pm/V was obtained for the KNN ceramics selected by ET. By contrast, as indicated by the dashed line in c, the KNN ceramics selected by EI exhibited relatively smaller strains and lower d 33\u2217. Apparently, this trend in the high-field piezoelectric properties for the compositions chosen by the ET and EI functions was similar to that of the d 33 values shown in , reinforcing the accuracy of the ML prediction for the d 33. In addition, b shows that the Comp5_ET_3E^{rd} displayed asymmetric bipolar S-E curves, indicating the presence of defect dipoles. Interestingly, KNN-based ceramics with enhanced piezoelectric properties were successfully identified using the methods outlined in this study. The SVR_r model and pure exploitation strategy led to the discovery of compositions with a d 33 of >300 pC/N, exceeding that of most compositions in the original dataset. From an active learning perspective, a database compiled from published literature may contain noise that prevents the ML models from making accurate predictions across the entire search space. From the perspective of KNN-based ceramics, a well-designed chemical formula is crucial for achieving high-performance KNN piezoceramics. Variations in ceramic processing can cause deviations in the expected d 33 values for KNN compositions. The performance evaluation demonstrated that the ML models effectively captured the underlying data trends. The results demonstrate that combining ML models with efficient search strategies is valuable in identifying high-performing compositions. We believe that by iterating the process and expanding the database, the design and discovery of KNN-based ceramics can be further accelerated using a balanced exploitation-exploration strategy.

The features in the feature pool were divided into six categories: 1) size factors, such as atomic volume (V), valence electron distance (RDVE) and core electron distance (RDCE); 2) electrochemical factors, such as EN-P, Matyonov-Batsanov electronegativity (EN-MB) and EA; 3) atomic number factors, such as atomic number (AN), Clementi effective nuclear charge (EFF-C) and Slater effective nuclear charge (EFF-S); 4) bond parameter factors, such as polarisability (P) and the ratio of valence electron number to nominal charge (Vec/Z); 5) unique factors, such as tolerance factor (t) and octahedral factor (u) and 6) additional factors, such as the K/Na ratio and influence of doping element on the R-O phase transition temperature (T R_O ). Those features meet the rational criteria of material features , which are 1) representative to the material, 2) sensitive to the target property and 3) easy to obtain. In total, 31 features were prepared for selection. shows the Pearson correlation heatmap, which illustrates the correlation matrix of the features. Features with r > 0.95 were considered redundant in the ML models. For example, t was retained while R, AO, CVW, RCOV and EVW were excluded. Thus, the number of features was reduced to 20. We analysed the contribution of each remaining feature to predict d 33 using the gradient-boosted method. shows the top 10 features ranked by their importance in describing d 33. Features with lower importance scores contributed less to the prediction of d 33 than features with higher scores. The phase transition temperature features were identified as important from the ML perspective. This result can be explained by the fact that the K/Na ratio can not generally reflect the impact of dopants on d 33. Different K/Na can implicate the same high d 33  in the view of the ML model, making it difficult for the model to learn the d 33 pattern based on the undetermined stoichiometry of dopants. As a result, the K/Na has not been marked with high importance from the aspect of the ML algorithm. At this stage, we developed precise predictive ML models for predicting d 33 based on selected features. The most appropriate ML model type was first selected. As shown in a, the SVR_r model achieved the lowest RMSE when the number of features exceeded three. The comparison between SVR_l, SVR_p and SVR_r highlighted the advantage of the radial basis function kernel in handling nonlinearly separable data, thereby outperforming both the polynomial and linear function kernels. Although the RR and SVR_l models performed similarly owing to their linear nature, the RFR model, despite performing well with less than three features, did not match the performance of the SVR_r model with high-dimensional input data. Overall, the SVR_r model demonstrated robust performance for up to eight features, making it the preferred choice for this study owing to its superior performance compared to other ML algorithms. This result confirmed the advantage of SVR_r in predicting the d 33 values of piezoceramics. To evaluate the SVR_r model for previously unobserved data, we extracted 20 % of the data from the database as a test set. b illustrates the variation in the performance of the SVR_r model validated by a 10-fold CV with an increasing number of input features. For both the training/validation and test sets, a noticeable decrease in RMSE and an increase in R E^{ } for up to five features were observed. This tendency demonstrated the ML process from underfitting to overfitting. Based on Occam's razor principle, we selected the feature tuples \u2018W, D, EN-P, EA, T c \u2019 for further validation of the SVR_r model. The selected EN-P and D features are closely related to the features identified as important and general to ferroelectric materials. The EN-P and previously identified Matyonov-Batsanov electronegativity both reflect electronegativity. However, the features eventually used for ML modelling can vary according to specific material systems and target properties. In this case study, the EN-P, D united with W, EA and T c were selected to describe the d 33 value of multidoped KNN-based piezoceramics based on the model evaluation result. The hyperparameter optimisation process of the SVR_r model with the five-tuple features is shown in c. In the SVR_r model, the hyperparameter C acted as a regularisation parameter that controlled the degree of penalty for estimation errors. The hyperparameter \u03b3 determines the extent to which a single training point influences the decision boundary. A larger \u03b3 causes the decision boundary to be more easily affected by points close to it, potentially resulting in a more complex decision boundary that may also overfit the training data. During the grid search process, C was varied from 0 to 10 in increments of 0.2, whereas \u03b3 was varied from 0.1 to 5 in increments of 0.1. The results indicate that the SVR_r model with \u03b3 < 2 and C < 4 exhibited relatively good performance based on the KNN database. In conclusion, excessive feature numbers and hyperparameters that overly complicate the model can lead to overfitting, which decreases model performance. d illustrates the regression and generalisation performance of the SVR_r model with the five-tuple features. In this study, most predicted d 33 values approximately matched the measured values in both the training and test sets. Notably, the ML models tended to \u2018overestimate\u2019 the points when their d 33 was <300 pC/N and \u2018underestimate\u2019 the points when their d 33 was >300 pC/N. A similar phenomenon was reported in a study on BT-based piezoceramics. For points with d 33 values < 300 pC/N, the deviation was likely owing to the high sensitivity of the KNN-based ceramics to sintering conditions. Slight variation in the optimal sintering temperature and duration can lead to significant decrease in d 33. Conversely, for points with d 33 > 300 pC/N, the compositions may be near the polymorphic phase boundary (PPB) in KNN-based ceramics. Compositions near the PPB often exhibit significant d 33 improvements, making them appear as \u2018singular points\u2019 in the dataset. Consequently, the ML model suppressed the predicted d 33 for compositions near PPB and increased the predicted d 33 for compositions far from PPB to balance the prediction accuracy. We believe that identifying the specific features that characterise the PPB in KNN-based ceramics can potentially enhance the model performance. lists the LOOCV errors of the SVR_r model with the five input features. The CV error scale in this study was consistent with those observed in other lead-free systems. The lower errors obtained in this study can be attributed to the process of data standardisation during the ML modelling. When the observed data size is significantly smaller than the material design space, the pure exploitation ET function may easily get stuck in local optima because it does not account for model uncertainty during the search process. The EI function is a valuable tool for identifying global optima because it balances \u03bc and \u03c3. To obtain \u03bc and \u03c3, we trained 500 ML models on 500 datasets generated via the bootstrapping resampling method in this study. Because prediction variance was a key factor in using the EI in this study, the size of the bootstrapped dataset was kept relatively small, identical to the size of the original dataset. After bootstrapping, we trained and deployed ML models across the entire search space to obtain predicted distributions. We added an approximate \u2018bell curve\u2019 of the Gaussian distribution to represent the predicted d 33 distribution of the candidate compositions suggested by the ET and EI functions. The graph shows that the pure ET function identified compounds that were expected to perform well, with high predicted d 33 values located in a narrow range. In contrast, the EI function favoured exploring compositions with relatively higher uncertainties, resulting in predicted d 33 values spanning a broader range than those selected by the ET function. Finally, we conducted three iterations of the active learning loop to validate the proposed methods. d presents the model performance metrics RMSE and R E^{ } for the three experimental iterations. Although the ML performance remained stable on the training sets, it fluctuated on the test sets as the number of iterations increased. The \u2018singular points\u2019 that were randomly distributed between the training and test sets significantly influenced the performance metrics of the ML model. Increasing the number of iterations to expand the database can facilitate obtaining more stable performance metrics. presents the predicted and measured d 33 values for the selected compositions for each iteration. The predicted d 33 comprises the integer components of \u03bc and \u03c3 from 500 predictions generated by the ML models. For all six samples, the disparities between the predicted and measured d 33 values were not significant, demonstrating the excellent predictive capability of the ML models. The largest error of 22 % was observed for Comp4, which was suggested by the EI function in the second iteration. The inconsistencies between the predicted and measured d 33 values may be due to the small database size, which affects the predictions, or variations in sample quality that affect the measured values. Comparisons between the ET and EI functions revealed that the ET function outperformed the exploitation-exploration trade-off EI function in identifying KNN compositions with enhanced d 33, at least for the first three iterations. This result is consistent with a previous study on BT-based ceramics that also focused on the same target property d 33. However, the EI function may outperform ET in other cases, such as when searching for BT-based ceramics with enhanced electrostrains. Two factors likely explain the better performance of ET in this case study: 1) the EI function favoured exploration over exploitation, and the risks associated with exploration did not initially result in exceptional piezoelectricity in the KNN system, and 2) KNN-based ceramics are highly sensitive to compositional variations. A possible approach to emphasise or suppress the effect of exploration is to introduce a parameter \u03be into the EI formula to balance exploitation and exploration. Nevertheless, we believe that the EI function is necessary for optimising the d 33 value of KNN ceramics because it reduces uncertainties in ML models by searching for compositions with high predicted variance. In this study, all synthesised KNN-based ceramics exhibited relatively dense microstructures with an average grain size of 1\u20135 \u03bcm ( ). The SEM analysis indicated no significant differences in microstructures between the ceramics designed by ET and EI functions, suggesting the exclusion of the effects of the preparation methods on the different ceramics. shows the P-E hysteresis loops (a), the bipolar S-E curves (b) and the unipolar S-E curves (c), measured at a frequency of 10 Hz and room temperature for the KNN ceramics. The three compositions selected by ET demonstrated strong ferroelectricity, with P r values exceeding 20 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}. As shown in c (solid lines), the three compositions selected by ET exhibited a large electric field-induced strain exceeding 0.14 % at 30 kV/cm, corresponding to the high-field piezoelectric strain coefficient (d 33\u2217) of >476 p.m./V. The highest d 33\u2217 value of 537 pm/V was obtained for the KNN ceramics selected by ET. By contrast, as indicated by the dashed line in c, the KNN ceramics selected by EI exhibited relatively smaller strains and lower d 33\u2217. Apparently, this trend in the high-field piezoelectric properties for the compositions chosen by the ET and EI functions was similar to that of the d 33 values shown in , reinforcing the accuracy of the ML prediction for the d 33. In addition, b shows that the Comp5_ET_3E^{rd} displayed asymmetric bipolar S-E curves, indicating the presence of defect dipoles. Interestingly, KNN-based ceramics with enhanced piezoelectric properties were successfully identified using the methods outlined in this study. The SVR_r model and pure exploitation strategy led to the discovery of compositions with a d 33 of >300 pC/N, exceeding that of most compositions in the original dataset. From an active learning perspective, a database compiled from published literature may contain noise that prevents the ML models from making accurate predictions across the entire search space. From the perspective of KNN-based ceramics, a well-designed chemical formula is crucial for achieving high-performance KNN piezoceramics. Variations in ceramic processing can cause deviations in the expected d 33 values for KNN compositions. The performance evaluation demonstrated that the ML models effectively captured the underlying data trends. The results demonstrate that combining ML models with efficient search strategies is valuable in identifying high-performing compositions. We believe that by iterating the process and expanding the database, the design and discovery of KNN-based ceramics can be further accelerated using a balanced exploitation-exploration strategy.
