Single-crystal samples with the nominal compositions (1-x)[0.997(0.996K0.5Na0.5NbO3-0.004BiAlO3)-0.003MnO2]-xCuO [(1-x)(KNN-BA-MnO2)-xCuO] (x = 0, 0.001, 0.003, 0.005, 0.007, 0.009) were prepared by the SFSSCG method. Sodium carbonate (Na2CO3,99.8 %), potassium carbonate (K2CO3,99 %), aluminium trioxide (Al2O3,99.5 %) bismuth oxide (Bi2O3,99 %) manganese dioxide (MnO2,85.0 %), copper oxide (CuO,99 %), (from Xi long Chemical Co., Ltd., China), niobium oxide (Nb2O5,99.5 %), (Sinopharm Group Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China) were used as raw materials. The raw materials powders were first placed in an oven and heated to 120 \xb0C for 6 h. Then the raw materials were weighed in accordance with the nominal stoichiometric ratio and mixed into a ball-milled tank filled with anhydrous ethanol and zirconia ball medium (HDPE material). The mixture was mixed on a horizontal rolling ball mill at a rotating speed of 410 r/min for 24 h and then dried. The obtained mixture was sieved by a 100-mesh sifter and then calcined at 750 \xb0C for 6 h. The calcined powders were subjected to secondary ball milling for 24 h, and then sieved through a 150-mesh sifter after dried. The synthesized powders were then compacted to disks of 25 mm in diameter and 2\u20133 mm in thickness, followed by normal sintering in air at 1108 \xb0C for 21 h in a muffle furnace. As the next step, the as-grown crystals were cut out from the ceramic matrix and ground into disc-like specimens with a thickness of 0.5\u20130.6 mm. The sintered samples were poled under a DC field of 30 kV/cm at 100\xb0C for 30 min in a silicone oil bath. The phase structure of the calcined powder and single-crystals was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Empyrean PIXcel3D, PANalytical, Netherlands Cu-K\u03b11). The XRD test conditions: the step width is 0.01\xb0/step, the diffraction angle range is 20\u201380\xb0, and the sweeping rate is 10\xb0/min, and the working current and voltage are 200 mA and 45 kV, respectively. The morphologies of the samples were analyzed using field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Quanta 450 FEG, FET Company, America) at appropriate magnification. The chemical compositions and elemental distribution in the crystals were determined using an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS, X-Max 20, Oxford Instruments, UK). The quasistatic piezoelectric coefficient (d 33 ) of the crystals was measured approximately 24 h after poling using a quasi-static d33 testing meter (ZJ-3AN, Institute of Acoustics, Academy of Sciences, China). The temperature dependence of dielectric constant (\u025b r ) and loss (tan \u03b4) for the crystals was examined using a programmable furnace with precision impedance analyzer (HP4294A, ANGILENT, USA). The hysteresis loops of the polarization-electrical field (P-E) curves at 10 Hz, and the unipolar electric-field-induced strain (S-E) curves at 0.1 Hz, were measured at room temperature in situ using the ferroelectric comprehensive analyzer (TF ANALYZER 2000HS, aixACCT Systems GmbH, Germany).

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In order to study the effect of CuO doping on the morphology, structure and electrical properties of the single crystals, (1-x)[0.997(0.996 K0.5Na0.5NbO3-0.004BiAlO3)-0.003MnO2]-xCuO (x = 0 \u223c 0.009) samples were prepared by the SFSSCG method, as shown in. When x = 0.003 the crystal size reaches the maximum value of, about 15 \xd7 12 \xd7 2 mmE^{3}, as shown in. The reason may lie in that the addition of CuE^{2+} ions promotes the formation of liquid phase and reduces the crystal growth barrier in the system. It is worth noting that the color of the crystals also changes before and after doping, due to the introduction of CuE^{2+} ions, implying that CuE^{2+} ions enter the crystalline lattices of the single crystals and cause changes in its natures. (a) shows the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of (1-x)[0.997(0.996K0.5Na0.5NbO3-0.004BiAlO3)-0.003MnO2]-xCuO (x = 0 \u223c 0.009) crystals From the intensity-2\u03b8 relationship diagram, it can be seen that at room temperature, all single crystals have a typical perovskite structure, and the phases present in these crystals include two ones: orthorhombic and tetragonal. No diffraction pattern of impurity phase was found in the XRD spectrums, indicating that BiE^{3+}, AlE^{3+}, MnE^{4+} and CuE^{2+} ions have entered the lattices of the KNN crystals and formed a stable solid solution without other impurities. (b) shows a local magnification of the XRD patterns in the 2\u03b8 range of 44\u201348\xb0. It can be seen in the (b) that at about 45\xb0 there are two splitting diffraction peaks, which shift slightly to higher angles with the increase of CuO content. According to the Bragg equation: n\u03bb = 2dsin\u03b8, the shift of the diffraction peak to lower or higher angles reflects the lattice expansion or contraction caused by lattice distortion, which has been reported in previous studies. These phenomena should be explained by the introduction of CuE^{2+} ions in the KNN-based crystals. On the one hand, the radius of CuE^{2+} (0.72 \xc5) ions is lower than that of KE^{+} (1.64 \xc5) and NaE^{+} (1.39 \xc5) ions, but very close to that of NbE^{5+} (0.64 \xc5) ions. Korbel et al. theoretically studied the Cu-doped KNN systems, and proved that CuE^{2+} preferentially replaced NbE^{5+} sites in an oxygen atmosphere. A small amount of CuE^{2+} ions first enter the lattices and replace NbE^{5+} sites that are the B sites of the ABO3 lattices, causing lattice expansion and local valence imbalance. On the other hand, from the perspective of ion coordination number, the coordination number of MnE^{3+} ions is VI with radius of 0.645\xc5 and 0.58 \xc5, at high and low spin states, respectively. And the radius of MnE^{4+} (0.53 \xc5) ions is also close to that of NbE^{5+} (0.64 \xc5) ions. MnE^{4+}/MnE^{3+} ions prefer to occupy the B sites rather than the A sites (NaE^{+} (1.39 \xc5), KE^{+} (1.64 \xc5)). Furthermore, the oxygen vacancies caused by the substitution of MnE^{4+}/MnE^{3+} and CuE^{2+} ions for NbE^{5+} ion acceptors are conducive to mass migration and grain growth. In this work, it is believed that CuE^{2+} ions and MnE^{4+}/MnE^{3+} ions occupy the B sites of the lattices of the KNN crystals. To determine the phases present and their relative amounts in the single crystal samples, the above XRD data was refined by Rietveld theory (using PullProf software). The results of the refinement are shown in , further confirming that all single crystal samples exhibit a perovskite crystal structure with two phases coexisting of the orthorhombic phase with Amm2 (JCPDS 71-0946) and tetragonal phase with P4mm (JCPDS 71-0945). When x = 0.003, the percentage of the orthorhombic phase is about 42 %, while the percentage of tetragonal phase is 58 %, which is consistent with the XRD patterns mentioned above. Researches have indicated that when the intensity ratio of the (022)/(200) peaks is close to 1:1, the relative amounts of the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases are close to 1:1. The above results indicate that the addition of elements such as Cu and Mn can regulate the phase amounts without changing the ferroelectric perovskite structure of the KNN crystals, thus potentially controlling their piezoelectric properties. shows the SEM photos of the natural surface morphology of (1-x)[0.997(0.996K0.5Na0.5NbO3-0.004BiAlO3)-0.003MnO2]-xCuO (x = 0 \u223c 0.009) crystals, indicating that the crystals grow in a two-dimensional layered manner. Compared with other samples, the surface of the crystals at x = 0.003 and 0.005 is flatter and smoother, indicating that the samples have better crystallinity. In order to observe their internal structure, the KNN-based single crystals were polished and etched with hydrofluoric acid. The positive end of the dipole moment is etched very quickly by the acid, while the negative end is etched very slowly. shows the SEM images of the ferroelectric domains and their distribution inside the (1-x)(KNN-BA-Mn)-xCuO crystals. The results show that the crystals are mainly composed of 180\xb0 domains which are similar to the parallel layered structure. When the CuO doping content is at x = 0.003, the average ferroelectric domain width of the single crystal is the smallest, about 284 nm, while its piezoelectric constant is the largest, which is 583 pC/N. This indicates that Cu doping can not only regulate the phase content of KNN-based crystals, but also their domain structure, thereby controlling their piezoelectric properties. In addition to the domain structure characteristics mentioned above, the internal structure of the crystal is extremely compact and no pores are observed, implying that the crystals have high quality which is also beneficial for improving the performance of the crystals. (a) and (b) show the dependence of dielectric constant (\u03b5) and loss (tan \u03b4) measured at 50 kHz on temperature (T) of (1-x)(KNN-BA-Mn)-xCuO single crystals. In addition, (b) also shows the relationship between the dielectric loss and temperature below 200 \xb0C for the single crystal samples. From (b), it can be seen that all the crystals have relatively low dielectric loss below 200 \xb0C, less than 2 %. When x = 0.003, the dielectric loss of the crystal is the lowest, at 0. 67 %. This indicates that proper doping of CuO can reduce dielectric loss of KNN-based crystals and improve their crystal quality. And in CuE^{2+} doped KNN, defect dipoles are formed between oxygen vacancies and CuE^{2+} cations. Moreover, (c) shows the relationship curves of T O-T and T C as a function of x for (1-x)(KNN-BA-Mn)-xCuO single crystals. When x = 0.003, the T C of the crystal reaches a maximum value of 418\xb0C, while the T O-T is relatively low, which is beneficial for expanding its working temperature range. (a) shows the dependence of piezoelectric coefficient (d 33 ) and dielectric loss (tan \u03b4) on CuO content of the crystals at room temperature. It can be seen from the figure that the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 of the crystals has a strong dependence on the CuO content. With the increase of CuO content, the d 33 value first increases and then decreases. When x = 0.003, the d 33 value reaches the maximum of 583 pC/N. When the doping amount is at x = 0.003, the minimum dielectric loss of 0.67 % is obtained for the crystal. This may attribute to the substitution of CuE^{2+} ions for NbE^{5+} ions in the KNN lattices. With the increase of x, the substitution degree of CuE^{2+} for NbE^{5+} ions gradually has been intensified, and then the charges distribution in the crystals has gradually stabilized, which has made the dielectric loss of the crystals decrease. When the x value continues to increase up to 0.003, the substitution degree of CuE^{2+} to NbE^{5+} ions reaches an equilibrium state, and the charges distribution in the crystal has also approached stabilization, which minimizes the dielectric loss of the crystal. However, as the CuO doping amount further increases, the oxygen vacancies on the crystals also increase, resulting in a "pinning effect" on the domain wall, causing the d 33 of the crystals to decrease. In addition, the stability of the crystal phase structure and lattice vibration will also affect the change of tan \u03b4 value of dielectrics. The mechanical quality factor, Q m , and thickness electromechanical coupling coefficient k t of (1-x)(KNN-BA-Mn)-xCuO are shown in (b). It is obvious that the dependence of Q m and k t on CuO content is similar to that of the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 , revealing the hard-doping characteristics of CuE^{2+} ions in KNN system. When x = 0.003, the Q m and k t of the crystal reach the maximum values of 96 and 0.39, respectively. Overall, when the Cu content is at x 0.003, the crystal obtains the best electrical properties including the piezoelectric, dielectric and electromechanical coupling since the crystal has high compactness and quality, smooth and straight parallel domains, stoichiometry with a minimal mismatch, and two-phases coexistence with appropriate percentage at this time. What\u2019s more, the width of the parallel domains is the smallest for the crystal at x = 0.003, meaning that the domain rotation is more easily triggered by an external electric field, which enhances the piezoelectric activities of the KNN-based crystals. (a) shows the hysteresis loops of (1-x)(KNN-BA-Mn)-xCuO single crystals under an electric field of 30 kV/cm. It can be seen from the figure that all crystals exhibit typical ferroelectric properties, and have good saturated P-E loops, with low coercive fields of E C <10 kV/cm. What\u2019s more, the presence of a two-phase coexistence region also makes domain wall movement become easier. b shows the curves of P r and E C of (1-x)(KNN-BA-Mn)-xCuO single crystals as a function of CuO content (x). It is observed that the P r of the samples first increases and then decreases with the increase of x, reaching a maximum value of 38.9 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at x = 0.003. This is due to the changes in the average domain width, phase amounts and lattice distortion caused by the addition of Cu\xb2\u207a ions, which promotes the activation of ferroelectric domains in the crystal, thereby enhancing its polarization. Excessive CuO addition introduces a large number of defects, exerting a strong pinning effect on domain rotation, which overrides the promotion of domain rotation by domain refinement. (c) is the hysteresis loops of the sample with x = 0.003 tested at different frequencies. It can be seen from the figure that the residual polarization intensity (P r ) reaches up to 50 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at low frequencies. At frequencies greater than 10 Hz, the P r of the samples is almost stably at 20 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}. This can be reflected by the P-E loops since the shape of the P-E curves can be obvious affected by leakage current, and leakage current usually enlarges the observed values of the Pr and Ec. (d) is the hysteresis loops of the CuO-doped samples at 40 Hz. All single crystals show a relatively stable remnant polarization intensity P r (about 20 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}) and a relatively small E C (10\u201312 kV/cm), indicating that the single crystals have good intrinsic ferroelectric properties. summarizes some of main electrical properties of the crystals investigated in this work. For comparative purposes, it also includes relative parameters of KNN-based ceramics and crystals reported in the literatures. These results suggest that the Cu-containing multiple elements codoped KNN crystals grown by the SFSSCG method have promising potential for future applications.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In order to study the effect of CuO doping on the morphology, structure and electrical properties of the single crystals, (1-x)[0.997(0.996 K0.5Na0.5NbO3-0.004BiAlO3)-0.003MnO2]-xCuO (x = 0 \u223c 0.009) samples were prepared by the SFSSCG method, as shown in. When x = 0.003 the crystal size reaches the maximum value of, about 15 \xd7 12 \xd7 2 mmE^{3}, as shown in.

No diffraction pattern of impurity phase was found in the XRD spectrums, indicating that BiE^{3+}, AlE^{3+}, MnE^{4+} and CuE^{2+} ions have entered the lattices of the KNN crystals and formed a stable solid solution without other impurities. (b) shows a local magnification of the XRD patterns in the 2\u03b8 range of 44\u201348\xb0. It can be seen in the (b) that at about 45\xb0 there are two splitting diffraction peaks, which shift slightly to higher angles with the increase of CuO content. According to the Bragg equation: n\u03bb = 2dsin\u03b8, the shift of the diffraction peak to lower or higher angles reflects the lattice expansion or contraction caused by lattice distortion, which has been reported in previous studies. These phenomena should be explained by the introduction of CuE^{2+} ions in the KNN-based crystals. On the one hand, the radius of CuE^{2+} (0.72 \xc5) ions is lower than that of KE^{+} (1.64 \xc5) and NaE^{+} (1.39 \xc5) ions, but very close to that of NbE^{5+} (0.64 \xc5) ions.

On the other hand, from the perspective of ion coordination number, the coordination number of MnE^{3+} ions is VI with radius of 0.645\xc5 and 0.58 \xc5, at high and low spin states, respectively. And the radius of MnE^{4+} (0.53 \xc5) ions is also close to that of NbE^{5+} (0.64 \xc5) ions. MnE^{4+}/MnE^{3+} ions prefer to occupy the B sites rather than the A sites (NaE^{+} (1.39 \xc5), KE^{+} (1.64 \xc5)). Furthermore, the oxygen vacancies caused by the substitution of MnE^{4+}/MnE^{3+} and CuE^{2+} ions for NbE^{5+} ion acceptors are conducive to mass migration and grain growth. In this work, it is believed that CuE^{2+} ions and MnE^{4+}/MnE^{3+} ions occupy the B sites of the lattices of the KNN crystals. To determine the phases present and their relative amounts in the single crystal samples, the above XRD data was refined by Rietveld theory (using PullProf software). The results of the refinement are shown in , further confirming that all single crystal samples exhibit a perovskite crystal structure with two phases coexisting of the orthorhombic phase with Amm2 (JCPDS 71-0946) and tetragonal phase with P4mm (JCPDS 71-0945). When x = 0.003, the percentage of the orthorhombic phase is about 42 %, while the percentage of tetragonal phase is 58 %, which is consistent with the XRD patterns mentioned above. Researches have indicated that when the intensity ratio of the (022)/(200) peaks is close to 1:1, the relative amounts of the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases are close to 1:1. The above results indicate that the addition of elements such as Cu and Mn can regulate the phase amounts without changing the ferroelectric perovskite structure of the KNN crystals, thus potentially controlling their piezoelectric properties. shows the SEM photos of the natural surface morphology of (1-x)[0.997(0.996K0.5Na0.5NbO3-0.004BiAlO3)-0.003MnO2]-xCuO (x = 0 \u223c 0.009) crystals, indicating that the crystals grow in a two-dimensional layered manner.

When the CuO doping content is at x = 0.003, the average ferroelectric domain width of the single crystal is the smallest, about 284 nm, while its piezoelectric constant is the largest, which is 583 pC/N. This indicates that Cu doping can not only regulate the phase content of KNN-based crystals, but also their domain structure, thereby controlling their piezoelectric properties. In addition to the domain structure characteristics mentioned above, the internal structure of the crystal is extremely compact and no pores are observed, implying that the crystals have high quality which is also beneficial for improving the performance of the crystals. (a) and (b) show the dependence of dielectric constant (\u03b5) and loss (tan \u03b4) measured at 50 kHz on temperature (T) of (1-x)(KNN-BA-Mn)-xCuO single crystals. In addition, (b) also shows the relationship between the dielectric loss and temperature below 200 \xb0C for the single crystal samples. From (b), it can be seen that all the crystals have relatively low dielectric loss below 200 \xb0C, less than 2 %. When x = 0.003, the dielectric loss of the crystal is the lowest, at 0. 67 %. This indicates that proper doping of CuO can reduce dielectric loss of KNN-based crystals and improve their crystal quality. And in CuE^{2+} doped KNN, defect dipoles are formed between oxygen vacancies and CuE^{2+} cations. Moreover, (c) shows the relationship curves of T O-T and T C as a function of x for (1-x)(KNN-BA-Mn)-xCuO single crystals. When x = 0.003, the T C of the crystal reaches a maximum value of 418\xb0C, while the T O-T is relatively low, which is beneficial for expanding its working temperature range. (a) shows the dependence of piezoelectric coefficient (d 33 ) and dielectric loss (tan \u03b4) on CuO content of the crystals at room temperature. It can be seen from the figure that the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 of the crystals has a strong dependence on the CuO content. With the increase of CuO content, the d 33 value first increases and then decreases. When x = 0.003, the d 33 value reaches the maximum of 583 pC/N. When the doping amount is at x = 0.003, the minimum dielectric loss of 0.67 % is obtained for the crystal. This may attribute to the substitution of CuE^{2+} ions for NbE^{5+} ions in the KNN lattices. With the increase of x, the substitution degree of CuE^{2+} for NbE^{5+} ions gradually has been intensified, and then the charges distribution in the crystals has gradually stabilized, which has made the dielectric loss of the crystals decrease. When the x value continues to increase up to 0.003, the substitution degree of CuE^{2+} to NbE^{5+} ions reaches an equilibrium state, and the charges distribution in the crystal has also approached stabilization, which minimizes the dielectric loss of the crystal. However, as the CuO doping amount further increases, the oxygen vacancies on the crystals also increase, resulting in a "pinning effect" on the domain wall, causing the d 33 of the crystals to decrease. In addition, the stability of the crystal phase structure and lattice vibration will also affect the change of tan \u03b4 value of dielectrics. The mechanical quality factor, Q m , and thickness electromechanical coupling coefficient k t of (1-x)(KNN-BA-Mn)-xCuO are shown in (b). It is obvious that the dependence of Q m and k t on CuO content is similar to that of the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 , revealing the hard-doping characteristics of CuE^{2+} ions in KNN system. When x = 0.003, the Q m and k t of the crystal reach the maximum values of 96 and 0.39, respectively. Overall, when the Cu content is at x 0.003, the crystal obtains the best electrical properties including the piezoelectric, dielectric and electromechanical coupling since the crystal has high compactness and quality, smooth and straight parallel domains, stoichiometry with a minimal mismatch, and two-phases coexistence with appropriate percentage at this time. What\u2019s more, the width of the parallel domains is the smallest for the crystal at x = 0.003, meaning that the domain rotation is more easily triggered by an external electric field, which enhances the piezoelectric activities of the KNN-based crystals. (a) shows the hysteresis loops of (1-x)(KNN-BA-Mn)-xCuO single crystals under an electric field of 30 kV/cm. It can be seen from the figure that all crystals exhibit typical ferroelectric properties, and have good saturated P-E loops, with low coercive fields of E C <10 kV/cm. What\u2019s more, the presence of a two-phase coexistence region also makes domain wall movement become easier. b shows the curves of P r and E C of (1-x)(KNN-BA-Mn)-xCuO single crystals as a function of CuO content (x). It is observed that the P r of the samples first increases and then decreases with the increase of x, reaching a maximum value of 38.9 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at x = 0.003. This is due to the changes in the average domain width, phase amounts and lattice distortion caused by the addition of Cu\xb2\u207a ions, which promotes the activation of ferroelectric domains in the crystal, thereby enhancing its polarization. Excessive CuO addition introduces a large number of defects, exerting a strong pinning effect on domain rotation, which overrides the promotion of domain rotation by domain refinement. (c) is the hysteresis loops of the sample with x = 0.003 tested at different frequencies. It can be seen from the figure that the residual polarization intensity (P r ) reaches up to 50 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at low frequencies. At frequencies greater than 10 Hz, the P r of the samples is almost stably at 20 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}. This can be reflected by the P-E loops since the shape of the P-E curves can be obvious affected by leakage current, and leakage current usually enlarges the observed values of the Pr and Ec. (d) is the hysteresis loops of the CuO-doped samples at 40 Hz. All single crystals show a relatively stable remnant polarization intensity P r (about 20 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}) and a relatively small E C (10\u201312 kV/cm), indicating that the single crystals have good intrinsic ferroelectric properties. summarizes some of main electrical properties of the crystals investigated in this work. For comparative purposes, it also includes relative parameters of KNN-based ceramics and crystals reported in the literatures. These results suggest that the Cu-containing multiple elements codoped KNN crystals grown by the SFSSCG method have promising potential for future applications.
