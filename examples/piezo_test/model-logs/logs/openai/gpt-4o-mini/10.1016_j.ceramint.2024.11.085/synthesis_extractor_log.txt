High purity raw materials, Bi2O3 (99.9 %, Sigma-Aldrich), Na2CO3 (99.9 % Merck), TiO2 (99.8 %, Sigma-Aldrich), BaCO3 (99 %, Sigma-Aldrich), Mn2O3 (99+%, Sigma Aldrich) and B2O3 (99.98 %, Alfa Aesar), were used to prepare undoped, 1 mol% BE^{3+} doped (1B) and 1 mol% BE^{3+} and 1 mol% MnE^{3+} co-doped (1B-1Mn) BNT-6BT ceramics by the solid-state reaction method. The equal amount of both dopant concentration as 1 mol% BE^{3+} and 1 mol% MnE^{3+} was chosen based on the current literature. In order to obtain a homogenous batch, the weighed raw materials were ball-milled for 24 h in ethanol using zirconia balls with 3 mm of diameter. The phase formation of dried and calcined powders (900 \xb0C for 4 h) was analyzed using the X-ray diffraction technique (XRD). Before the second milling process, 1 mol% BE^{3+} was added to both pre-synthesized undoped and 1 mol% MnE^{3+} doped BNT-6BT. Uniaxially pressed at 100 MPa pressure disc samples with a diameter of 12 mm were shaped using the screened powders (<90 \u03bcm) mixed with 5 wt% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a binder. In order to provide a higher final density, pre-shaped specimens were re-pressed via a cold isostatic press (CIP) at 150 MPa. PVA binder was burnt out at 600 \xb0C for 4 h in the furnace set to a 1 \xb0C/min heating rate. A sintering process at 1150 \xb0C was performed for 12 h in air. The Archimedes method (ASTM C373)  was used for bulk density measurements. Sintered ceramics with different compositions were analyzed by using an x-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8 Advance) with CuK\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 1.5406 \xc5) for crystal structure determination, phase fraction and lattice parameters have been determined by using DiffracE^{plus}-TOPAS\xae software package (Bruker AXS, Karlsrule, Germany) for Rietveld refinement, and a scanning electron microscope (LEO 1430VP) for microstructure investigation. Polished and gold electroded samples were electrically characterized in terms of ferroelectric (P-E hysteresis loops) and piezoelectric (S-E curves) using a TFAnalyzer 2000 E (aixACCT Systems GmbH, Germany) at room temperature at the optimum switching conditions that were determined following a series of measurements. In order to determine the effect of different poling parameters on dielectric and piezoelectric properties, the samples were poled for the time duration of 5, 10, 15, and 20 min at room temperature (RT), 40, 60, and 80 \xb0C, and under an electric field between 3 and 5 kV/mm in silicone oil bath by using a high voltage supply amplifier/controller (Trek Model 610 E, Lockport, NY). First, the effect of poling time and electric field has been investigated at RT. By applying the optimum poling field for each composition determined at RT, the influence of poling temperature was observed after a poling process when both heating and cooling silicon oil in the range of given temperatures. For RT dielectric (\u03b5r and tan\u03b4) and piezoelectric (d33) measurements, an LCR-meter (Instek LCR-816) and a piezoelectric d33-m (APC YE2730A d33 METER) were used, respectively, after poling the samples at varying temperatures.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The room temperature XRD diffraction pattern of undoped, 1B-doped, 1B-1Mn co-doped BNT-6BT sintered ceramics have been shown in (a) where the 2\u03b8 range is 20\u201370\xb0. It can be seen that all samples have a pure perovskite structure without any secondary phase detected, indicating that all dopants have diffused into the BNT lattice and formed a homogeneous solid solution. As observed in the expanded XRD patterns of ceramics in the 2\u03b8 range of 39\u201347\xb0 ((b)), for samples of all compositions, peak splitting on (111) and (200) planes were found, implying that these ceramics possess the MPB composition, where the rhombohedral (R) and tetragonal (T) phases co-exist. The R-T phase percentage ratio of 60.74\u201339.26 clearly shows that BNT-6BT is located on the MPB position. However, both 1B single doping and 1B-1Mn co-doping greatly change the amounts of present phases in favor of R as the R% increases up to 93.41 and 83.69, respectively. The Rietveld refinement results also provided \u201cc/a\u201d ratios for the T phase as 1.0143, 1.0149, and 1.0013 for the undoped, 1B-doped, and 1B-1Mn co-doped BNT-6BT ceramics. This indicates increased \u201ctetragonality\u201d for Mn-doping in BNT-BT ceramics as also reported by Zhu et al.. The microstructure images of BNT-6BT ceramics taken with an SEM instrument (LEO 1430VP) have been given in. It is obvious that the grain size of 1B-1Mn co-doped sample is much coarser than that of undoped and 1B-doped ceramics, which is a characteristic effect of acceptor dopants as a result of increased oxygen vacancy in the grain boundaries. Similar results were observed by Zhu et al. as the grain size increases with the addition of Mn ion into (Na0.5Bi0.5)0.92Ba0.08TiO3 ceramics. The observed substantial grain growth was explained as the Mn ion entering into the perovskite lattice to substitute TiE^{4+} ion; leading to the creation of oxygen vacancies (Eq. ), which enhances the transfer of mass and energy between the reactants, thus improving the sintering behavior and inducing an increase in grain size continually. On the other hand, no significant change was observed in the microstructure and grain size in BNT-6BT when doped with NbE^{5+}, a well-known donor for the titanate perovskite systems, except that the dielectric loss is increased. As in the case of BE^{3+} doping in this study, donors are effective in suppressing the oxygen vacancy formation, thus, inhibiting grain growth. Theoretical densities (\u03c1th) of the ceramics with different compositions are calculated using reported theoretical densities of BNT-6BT, B2O3 and Mn2O3 as 5.99, 2.46 and 5.025 g/cmE^{3}, respectively. The calculated theoretical and relative density values are given in with the measured bulk densities (\u03c1b) and obtained electrical properties. The lower relative density value (85 %) was exhibited by 1B-1Mn co-doped ceramics, possessing coarse grains, compared to both undoped (93 %) and 1B-doped (95 %) ceramics. It has been also observed that the measured densities correlate well with the piezoelectric (d33) and dielectric (\u03b5r, tan\u03b4) properties in undoped and doped ceramics. shows the (P-E) hysteresis loop (a) and (S-E) strain curve (b) of the ceramics obtained at room temperature. From the P-E and S-E hysteresis loop plots, the maximum polarization (Pmax) where the material is fully polarized, the remenant polarization (Pr) that remains after the electric field is removed, the coercive field (EC) that cancels out the net polarization, and the maximum strain (|Smax|) which is calculated by Eq. where SE^{P} and SE^{N} gives the positive and negative strain values, respectively, data were extracted. As can be seen in , the highest values of Pmax, Pr, and EC were displayed by the 1B-doped ceramics. On the other hand, 1B-1Mn co-doped ceramics provided the lowest Pmax and Pr values. Additionally, it has been observed that the 1B-1Mn co-doped ceramics have a narrower strain curve than that of undoped and 1B-doped ones. The most prominent result among others here is the significant reduction of EC value in MnE^{3+} containing composition. This is consistent with the role of an acceptor dopant, i.e., MnE^{3+}, to balance the effects of single BE^{3+} doped BNT-6BT perovskite crystal. Indeed, it was one of the main goals in this study to reduce the EC by the addition of MnE^{3+}. The reduction of EC from 26.87 kV/cm for 1B to 22.73 kV/cm for 1B-1Mn is quite significant in terms of the aims of the study from the device applications perspective. shows the dependence of piezoelectric coefficient (d33) on poling time for all compositions and no considerable effect was observed for the samples in the range of 5\u201320 min at RT. However, the poling field has an improving effect on the piezoelectric properties of 1B-1Mn co-doped ceramics ( ). To elucidate the correlation between the poling field and the piezoelectric properties of the ceramics, all samples were poled in the range of 3\u20135 kV/mm at 25 \xb0C for 5 min. It was found that the poling field has no improving effect on the piezoelectric properties, except when 1B-1Mn co-doped ceramics were poled at 3.5 kV/mm electric field. Thus, it has been ascertained that as the poling field 3 kV/mm was enough for both undoped and 1B-single doped compositions, while 3.5 kV/mm provided higher d33 for 1B-1Mn co-doped samples. At the next step, all the samples were poled for 5 min at the temperature range of 25\u201380 \xb0C under the optimum electric field for each composition. show the change of piezoelectric (d33) and dielectric properties (\u03b5r and tan\u03b4) as a function of the poling temperature, respectively. It was observed that d33 values decreased for undoped and 1B-doped compositions at higher temperatures, as 1B-1Mn co-doped ceramics have improved values at 60 \xb0C. It can be presumed that this difference is a result of MnE^{3+} doping, which obstructs domain motion in the material since it behaves as an acceptor by replacing TiE^{4+} ions. With respect to all collected data, the poling temperature has been chosen as the RT (25 \xb0C) for undoped and 1B-doped, and 60 \xb0C for 1B-1Mn co-doped BNT-6BT ceramics. summarizes the piezoelectric and dielectric properties of the poled samples for each composition with their optimum parameters. The results indicate that a significant improvement in d33 with an increase in tan\u03b4 has been observed in 1B composition. On the other hand, 1B-1Mn composition has provided the lowest tan\u03b4 value among all the compositions studied, which is a positive achievement for dielectric properties and complies with the aim of the study.
