Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'solid-state reaction', 'precursors': ['Bi2O3', 'Fe2O3', 'BaCO3', 'TiO2'], 'steps': ['Weighed powder was ground with zirconia balls in ethanol for 24 h.', 'Dried at 100 °C for 12 h.', 'Calcined in air at 760 °C for 6 h at a rate of 2 °C per minute.', 'Added 8 wt% of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a binder and pressed under uniaxial pressure of 10 MPa to form discs with a diameter of 8 mm.', 'Sintered at 970 °C for 6 h.', 'Sintered at 600 °C for 3 h to remove the PVA.', 'Applied silver paste to the surfaces and fired at 450 °C for 30 min.', 'Polarized in silicone oil at 110 °C for 15 min using a DC field of 5 kV/cm.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'SEM', 'LCR analyzer', 'ferroelectric detection system', 'high-temperature in-situ d33 measurement instrument', 'TEM']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
