As the temperature fluctuates, the piezoelectric coefficient d31 and dielectric constant \u03b533 undergo significant alterations, which consequently impact the overall functionality of PZT. To elucidate the key electrical thermal coupling mechanism of PZT, a nonlinear numerical model for the piezoelectric coefficient and dielectric constant under variable temperature environments is established. Furthermore, the impact of the bonding layers between the PZT and the structure on the Lamb wave under variable temperatures is incorporated into the simulation model. A thermal expansion stress model of the PZT-bonding layers-structure is developed to elucidate the mechanical-thermal coupling mechanism. Based on the COMSOL, a mechanical\u2013electrical-thermal direct coupling simulation model of PZT-bonding layers-structure under variable temperature has been established. The integrated model, which combines the piezoelectric model of sensors with the FEA models of structures, represents a significant advance in fully capturing the influence of variable environments on the excitation, propagation, and sensing of Lamb waves. Lamb wave data from \u221240 \xb0C to 80 \xb0C are obtained and compared with the simulated data. The results show that the A0 and S0 modes of the simulated signals are in good agreement with the experimental measurements. A multiphysics simulation method is proposed to propagate Lamb waves in PZT gel-layer structures in variable-temperature environments. In this setup, PZT is affixed to the structure via an adhesive, serving as both actuators and sensors. As shown in , the PZT serves as the Lamb wave actuator, where an applied voltage signal induces mechanical strain through the inverse piezoelectric effect, thereby exciting Lamb waves in the structure. The bonding layer is crucial in ensuring effective energy transfer from the PZT actuator to the structure. At the receiving end, another PZT sensor converts the received mechanical strain back into an electrical signal through the direct piezoelectric effect, allowing for Lamb wave detection and measurement. The first aspect involves the influence of temperature on the material parameters of structural components, encompassing the structure itself, the bonding layer, and PZT components. The second aspect concerns the effect of thermal stress on the piezoelectric constants of PZT, mainly arising from differences in thermal expansion coefficients among PZT, structural components, and the bonding layer. The primary operational principle of PZT is the piezoelectric effect, which enables the reciprocal conversion of electrical and mechanical energy. Where D is the potential shift-vector (the number of charges generated per unit area on the surface of the piezoelectric element). d is the matrix of piezoelectric constants; \u03c3 is the vector of stresses; \u03b5 is the matrix of dielectric constants; E is the vector of electric fields; e is the vector of strains; and s is the matrix of elastic flexibility. The response strength of the Lamb wave is closely related to the matrix of piezoelectric constants, which is mainly affected by d31. The piezoelectric material and the generated electric field are in direction 3 and the stress is in direction 1, as shown in. This article uses a PZT-5A circular PZT and applies voltage excitation signals in three directions to excite LW. Thus, E1= E2=0, E3\u22600. On this basis, the excitation strain and potential shift vectors of PZT can be calculated as Eqs. : a. Where \u0393 is the shear-lag coefficient, the expression is shown in Eq.. Where, l act and t act is the diameter and thickness of PZT, Y actE is the Young's modulus of PZT, t bond is the thickness of the bonding layer, G bond is the shear modulus of the bonding layer, t plate is the thickness of the flat structure, E plate is the elastic modulus of the structure, \u03b1 is a parameter that characterizes different modes. b. Where \u03be= \u03b5 sen/ \u03b5 plate-1, the symmetry of the circular PZT allows for the derivation of the following Eq. :  The strain relationship \u03be between Lamb waves in the structure and the strain of the piezoelectric sensor can be obtained, thus obtaining the strain of the piezoelectric sensor \u03b5 sen as Eq. :  V in is the input voltage of the piezoelectric exciter, parameter C act (\u0393) is defined as the value of shear force transmitted by the bonding layer in the excitation model, and parameter C sen (\u0393) is defined as the induced strain in the sensing model per unit of shear force in the excitation model, as follows in Eqs. :  In summary, the voltage V out of the Lamb wave signal output by PZT can be simply written as:  The Eq. is the theoretical model expression of PZT output voltage. From this, the piezoelectric coefficient d31 , dielectric constant \u03b533 , elastic modulus YE , and shear modulus G bond of the bonding layer itself have a significant impact on the signal amplitude. From Eq. , it can be seen that the amplitude of PZT output voltage is related to its material characteristics, namely the piezoelectric coefficient d31, dielectric constant \u03b533. Following a comprehensive examination of the relevant literatures , it has been discerned that the impedance, electromechanical coupling coefficient, and dielectric loss properties of PZT tend to exhibit a significant level of stability within the temperature range spanning from \u221260 \xb0C to 120 \xb0C. According to literature studies, both d31 have a linear relationship with temperature, assuming the d31,\u03b533 are:  Where, \u0394T is the temperature change value, bT is linear term of dielectric constant-temperature equation, cT is constant term of piezoelectric coefficient-temperature equation, b\u03b5 is linear term of dielectric constant-temperature equation, c\u03b5 is constant term of dielectric constant temperature equation. Furthermore, accounting for the notable differences in thermal expansion coefficients inherent in the three distinct materials comprising PZT, the bonding layers, and the structure is imperative. These differences underscore the significance of thermal stress experienced by PZT, a material that exhibits acute sensitivity to stress variations. In this context, it's crucial to recognize that the impact of thermal stress can be effectively modeled by considering the behavior of PZT under static load conditions. The application of external forces to PZT induces alterations in its polarization state. Consequently, this modulation affects the positive piezoelectric effect, which characterizes the relationship between force and electric properties within PZT. It was pointed out that due to the acoustic elasticity effect, the propagation speed of Lamb wave is affected by the load, and the stress\u2013strain intrinsic relationship of the structure under external load has nonlinear variation. Therefore, the thermal stress will have an effect on the nature of the piezoelectric transducer itself, which can be expressed as the piezoelectric constant of PZT and the dielectric coefficient have changed, so the amplitude of PZT will be affected by the load. The numerical relationship between stress and d31 can be expressed as follows:  Where, a\u03c3 is square term of piezoelectric coefficient-stress equation, b\u03c3 is constant term of piezoelectric coefficient-stress equation, c\u03c3 is linear term of piezoelectric coefficient-stress equation. Essentially, this model utilizes the effect of static load on d31 to replace the effect of thermal stress on d31. Consequently, this comprehensive numerical model encompasses both the effects of temperature (represented by variables d31 and \u03b533) and the effects of thermal stress (also impacting variables d31 and \u03b533). This amalgamation is expressed through Eq. :  According to Eqs. (10)-(12), C(\u0393) represents the relationship between the phase shift of Lamb wave propagation in a flat plate and the amplitude change of Lamb wave related to the shear lag model. In summary, the changes in Lamb wave signal amplitude under variable temperature environments are mainly caused by changes in piezoelectric coefficient d31, dielectric coefficient \u03b533, thermal stress, and bonding layers shear modulus. Based on elastic theory, the displacement and stress of Lamb waves in isotropic media can be expressed as frequency formulas for symmetric and antisymmetric modes , as follows:  Where k is the wave number, and p and q are functions related to the angular frequency \u03c9. is shown by the Eqs. :  The longitudinal and transverse wave speeds are given below:  Where v plate is the Poisson's ratio of the plate and \u03c1 plate is the density of the plate. Temperature-induced changes in properties such as Poisson's ratio and elastic modulus of solid structures have a linear correlation with temperature, as shown in Eq. :  Where, P is a mechanical property of the solid, such as its Young's modulus E, Poisson's ratio v, shear modulus G, bulk modulus K, etc., T is the general temperature, and T0 is the ambient temperature of 20\xb0 C, and (partial P (T))/partial T represents the temperature sensitivity. Sandia National Laboratory measured the elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of Al6061 at different temperatures using laser ultrasound with a reference temperature of 20 \xb0C. In this paper, the COMSOL is used. In addition, the thermal stress effect, piezoelectric effect, and temperature effect of PZT can be integrated into the simulation model. The multi-physics simulation architecture of Lamb wave propagation under PZT with temperature effect is shown in. a. 3D geometry and definitions  3D geometry and definitions The 3D geometry comprises an aluminum plate measuring 400 \xd7 200 \xd7 2 mm, along with a PZT and bonding layers, as shown in. The bonding layers have an 8 mm diameter and a thickness of 0.08 mm (see ). b. Simulation materials  Simulation materials The impact of temperature on Lamb wave propagation can be linked to its influence on the structure's material properties, PZTs, and bonding layers. Additionally, thermal stress loading affects the PZTs' material properties due to disparities in thermal expansion coefficients. c. Simulation physics  Simulation physics In solid mechanics, a foundational approach is implemented, utilizing default linear elastic materials for the aluminum structures, bonding layers, and PZT elements. Notably, piezoelectric properties are exclusively attributed to the PZT material. In this setup, solely the upper surface of a single PZT is endowed with an electric potential. Simultaneously, all lower surfaces of the PZTs are consistently grounded. A distinctive methodology is adopted by designating the upper surfaces of all PZTs as boundary probes, thereby facilitating the comprehensive capture of voltage response signals across all PZTs. COMSOL achieves this by directly incorporating piezoelectric effects into both solid mechanics and electrostatic mechanics. The reference temperature, denoted as T0, and the target temperature as Tem, play a pivotal role in this analysis. It is crucial to emphasize that, in this context, the presumption is that the temperature remains uniform across the structure, bonding layers, and PZT components. To circumvent these issues, COMSOL offers a solution through its rigid motion suppression boundary conditions. Finite Element (FE) meshes  Finite Element (FE) meshes In accordance with the literature's recommendations, it is prudent to adhere to a maximum grid size ranging from 1/10 to 1/6 of the minimum wavelength. In specific scenario, where Lamb waves are considered at a frequency of 160 kHz, the corresponding wave lengths measure 2 mm and 9 mm. This necessitates that the maximum mesh size for the aluminum plate should not exceed 1.5 mm. Considering that the thickness of PZTs and bonding layer are 0.48 mm and 0.08 mm, the mesh size of the PZTs and the bonding layer are set to 1 mm and 0.5 mm, respectively. Due to the relatively diminutive grid sizes. the model encompasses a substantial number of elements: 1.89 million domain elements, 553,000 boundary elements, 3800 edge elements, and a total of 5.2 million degrees of freedom, as shown in. e. Firstly, in step 1, the static research method was used to calculate the thermal stress of piezoelectric components caused by inconsistent thermal expansion coefficients. Finally, in step 2, use time-varying research to calculate Lamb wave propagation. Set the simulation time step to 0.1 \u03bcs, for time related studies, the time range is 0 s to 180 \u03bcs. The simulation is run on a DELL Precision 7920 Tower workstation equipped with two 3.2 GHz CPUs (AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 3995WX 64-Cores) and 256 GB of RAM. The simulation time for a single temperature condition using COMSOL 6.1 is 2520 s. f. Simulation results  Simulation results The simulation results are shown in , which shows the wavefields of Lamb wave propagation at different moments under \u221240 \xb0C, 0 \xb0C, 40 \xb0C and 80 \xb0C. As an illustration, when the temperature is \u221240 \xb0C, the wavefields can be observed at the specific moments of 26 \u03bcs, 41 \u03bcs and 88 \u03bcs. The S0 mode and A0 mode are normally excited, and the S0 mode propagates faster but with a weaker amplitude. The maximum magnitude of the Lamb wave is 1.122 \xd7 10E^{\u22127} at \u221240 \xb0C. Significant changes in the Lamb waveform of the S0 mode are observed at 0 \xb0C, 40 \xb0C, 80 \xb0C. At the same time points (26 \u03bcs, 41 \u03bcs and 88 \u03bcs), the amplitude of the Lamb waveform shifts to the right of the waveform, and the phase delay also becomes more significant. It is noteworthy that at \u221240 \xb0C, the S0 modal wave packet (orange wave packet) is precisely aligned with the reference line (red dashed line). At 0 \xb0C, 40 \xb0C, and 80 \xb0C, the S0 modal wave packet demonstrates a gradual deviation from the reference line. The data of the dielectric constant of PZT changing with temperature is collected by the dielectric temperature spectrum testing system (YZDM-RT-1000, Julang Technology Co., Ltd., Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China), as shown in. The data of the piezoelectric coefficient of PZT changing with temperature is collected by the piezoelectric temperature spectrum testing system (TZFD-300, Julang Technology Co., Ltd., Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China), as shown in. 5 pieces of the same type of PZT are used for the variable temperature experiments of piezoelectric and dielectric parameters to eliminate the discrete nature of the material of PZT. The five PZTs were sequentially placed in the measuring chamber of the dielectric coefficient measuring system, and the d33 under \u221240 \xb0C\u201380 \xb0C measured and recorded. Five pieces of PZT were sequentially placed in the measurement chamber of the piezoelectric coefficient measurement system, the \u03b533 under \u221240 \xb0C -80 \xb0C measured and recorded (see ). The d31 and \u03b533 numerical model in the temperature range of \u221240\u201380 \xb0C are investigated:  Where, \u0394T is the difference between the measured temperature and 20 \xb0C. At 20 \xb0C, d31 is \u2212185, \u03b533 is 2155. In addition, the coefficients of thermal expansion of the PZT, bonding layers, and aluminum structure are 3 \xd7 10E^{\u22126}, 5.4 \xd7 10E^{\u22127}, and 2.3 \xd7 10E^{\u22127}, respectively. According to , the nonlinear numerical relationship between thermal stress and d31 is shown in Eq. :  Therefore, the numerical model of the effect of temperature on d31 is superimposed with the numerical model of the effect of thermal stress on d31 as shown: where \u0394T is for the reference temperature at 20 \xb0C and \u0394 \u03c3T is the thermal stress in MPa. The parameter manual for the bonding layer, with a working temperature range of \u221260 \xb0C to 300 \xb0C and a storage modulus of 3.61 GPa. The numerical model of the shear modulus of adhesive changing with temperature is as follows:  The material properties of Al 6061 in variable temperature environment are given, as shown:  The experimental setup, as depicted in , comprises a sensing and data acquisition system along with an environmental enclosure. The excitation signal and recorded received signal are generated by the SHM system (Nanjing Smart Monitoring Technology Co., Ltd, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China.) with a sampling frequency of 60 MHz and a resolution of 12 bits. The environment box (RK-THX-100, KaiRui Co., Ltd, Dongguan, Guangdong Province, China.) is used to control the temperature of the structure with a temperature accuracy of 0.1 \xb0C. The specific properties of the PZT-bonding layers-structure are shown in. The PZT and the aluminum plate are bonded by epoxy adhesive. The entire temperature range is between \u221240\u201380 \xb0C, with signals collected every 10 \xb0C. The entire experimental process took about 12 h, and there was no continuous signal collection during the heating process. The center frequencies of Lamb wave excitation signals are 160 kHz, and the sampling frequency is 10 MHz (see and ). The Lamb wave signal at 160 kHz at different temperatures is given in. A magnified view of the S0 mode is provided, which gives a better view of the phase and amplitude variations. As the temperature rises, the piezoelectric coefficient and dielectric constant of PZT increase, resulting in an elevated equivalent capacitance of PZT. Consequently, the output voltage of PZT declines, reducing the amplitude of the output signal. In , a comprehensive comparison is presented, contrasting simulated and experimental signals under three distinct temperature conditions: \u221240 \xb0C, 20 \xb0C, and 80 \xb0C. This involved filtering and normalizing the signals, with specific focus on the normalization of the S0 mode's amplitude. Notably, the S0 mode exhibits robust waveform alignment, with negligible deviations in amplitude and phase observed for the A0 mode. These minor discrepancies in the A0 mode may be attributed to its smaller wavelength when compared to the S0 mode. In the analysis of Lamb wave signals, primary attention is paid to the first S0 and A0 wave packets, which are significant due to their minimal interference from wave packet superposition and boundary reflections. Additionally, the S0 wave packet exhibits high sensitivity in detecting metal damage. Notably, the simulation signals demonstrate a high degree of similarity with the experimental signals, particularly in terms of the S0 and A0 wave packets. However, as time passes, due to the dispersion characteristics and boundary reflections of Lamb waves in practical structures, the received wave packets undergo superposition and mode conversion, leading to complexities in the signals following the first A0 wave packet. Where, \u0394A is the change in amplitude at different temperatures, \u0394 up is the change in phase velocity at various temperatures. is the amplitude of the Lamb wave signal at different temperatures, A T0 is the amplitude of the Lamb wave signal at \u221240 \xb0C. lp is the propagation distance of the Lamb wave.t Tem Lamb wave signals' propagation time at different temperatures is the propagation time of Lamb wave signals \u221240 \xb0C. From , and , it can be seen that the S0 mode waveforms of the simulated signal and the experimental signal are consistent. At temperatures ranging from \u221240 \xb0C to 80 \xb0C, the amplitude increases and the phase velocity decreases as the temperature increases. And in this paper, the mechanic-electric-thermal coupling simulation model is constructed by modeling the key parameters of the PZT dynamically, as well as considering the effect of thermal expansion stress. The results show that the changes of the simulated and experimental signals are consistent, and the maximum relative error of the amplitude is 4.01 % and the maximum relative error of the phase velocity is 3.86 %.

The simulation time for a single temperature condition using COMSOL 6.1 is 2520 s. f. Simulation results  Simulation results The simulation results are shown in , which shows the wavefields of Lamb wave propagation at different moments under \u221240 \xb0C, 0 \xb0C, 40 \xb0C and 80 \xb0C. As an illustration, when the temperature is \u221240 \xb0C, the wavefields can be observed at the specific moments of 26 \u03bcs, 41 \u03bcs and 88 \u03bcs. The S0 mode and A0 mode are normally excited, and the S0 mode propagates faster but with a weaker amplitude. The maximum magnitude of the Lamb wave is 1.122 \xd7 10E^{\u22127} at \u221240 \xb0C. Significant changes in the Lamb waveform of the S0 mode are observed at 0 \xb0C, 40 \xb0C, 80 \xb0C. At the same time points (26 \u03bcs, 41 \u03bcs and 88 \u03bcs), the amplitude of the Lamb waveform shifts to the right of the waveform, and the phase delay also becomes more significant. It is noteworthy that at \u221240 \xb0C, the S0 modal wave packet (orange wave packet) is precisely aligned with the reference line (red dashed line). At 0 \xb0C, 40 \xb0C, and 80 \xb0C, the S0 modal wave packet demonstrates a gradual deviation from the reference line. The data of the dielectric constant of PZT changing with temperature is collected by the dielectric temperature spectrum testing system (YZDM-RT-1000, Julang Technology Co., Ltd., Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China), as shown in. The data of the piezoelectric coefficient of PZT changing with temperature is collected by the piezoelectric temperature spectrum testing system (TZFD-300, Julang Technology Co., Ltd., Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China), as shown in. 5 pieces of the same type of PZT are used for the variable temperature experiments of piezoelectric and dielectric parameters to eliminate the discrete nature of the material of PZT. The five PZTs were sequentially placed in the measuring chamber of the dielectric coefficient measuring system, and the d33 under \u221240 \xb0C\u201380 \xb0C measured and recorded. Five pieces of PZT were sequentially placed in the measurement chamber of the piezoelectric coefficient measurement system, the \u03b533 under \u221240 \xb0C -80 \xb0C measured and recorded (see ). The d31 and \u03b533 numerical model in the temperature range of \u221240\u201380 \xb0C are investigated:  Where, \u0394T is the difference between the measured temperature and 20 \xb0C. At 20 \xb0C, d31 is \u2212185, \u03b533 is 2155. In addition, the coefficients of thermal expansion of the PZT, bonding layers, and aluminum structure are 3 \xd7 10E^{\u22126}, 5.4 \xd7 10E^{\u22127}, and 2.3 \xd7 10E^{\u22127}, respectively. According to , the nonlinear numerical relationship between thermal stress and d31 is shown in Eq. :  Therefore, the numerical model of the effect of temperature on d31 is superimposed with the numerical model of the effect of thermal stress on d31 as shown: where \u0394T is for the reference temperature at 20 \xb0C and \u0394 \u03c3T is the thermal stress in MPa. The parameter manual for the bonding layer, with a working temperature range of \u221260 \xb0C to 300 \xb0C and a storage modulus of 3.61 GPa. The numerical model of the shear modulus of adhesive changing with temperature is as follows:  The material properties of Al 6061 in variable temperature environment are given, as shown:  The experimental setup, as depicted in , comprises a sensing and data acquisition system along with an environmental enclosure. The excitation signal and recorded received signal are generated by the SHM system (Nanjing Smart Monitoring Technology Co., Ltd, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China.) with a sampling frequency of 60 MHz and a resolution of 12 bits. The environment box (RK-THX-100, KaiRui Co., Ltd, Dongguan, Guangdong Province, China.) is used to control the temperature of the structure with a temperature accuracy of 0.1 \xb0C. The specific properties of the PZT-bonding layers-structure are shown in. The PZT and the aluminum plate are bonded by epoxy adhesive. The entire temperature range is between \u221240\u201380 \xb0C, with signals collected every 10 \xb0C. The entire experimental process took about 12 h, and there was no continuous signal collection during the heating process. The center frequencies of Lamb wave excitation signals are 160 kHz, and the sampling frequency is 10 MHz (see and ). The Lamb wave signal at 160 kHz at different temperatures is given in. A magnified view of the S0 mode is provided, which gives a better view of the phase and amplitude variations. As the temperature rises, the piezoelectric coefficient and dielectric constant of PZT increase, resulting in an elevated equivalent capacitance of PZT. Consequently, the output voltage of PZT declines, reducing the amplitude of the output signal. In , a comprehensive comparison is presented, contrasting simulated and experimental signals under three distinct temperature conditions: \u221240 \xb0C, 20 \xb0C, and 80 \xb0C. This involved filtering and normalizing the signals, with specific focus on the normalization of the S0 mode's amplitude. Notably, the S0 mode exhibits robust waveform alignment, with negligible deviations in amplitude and phase observed for the A0 mode. These minor discrepancies in the A0 mode may be attributed to its smaller wavelength when compared to the S0 mode. In the analysis of Lamb wave signals, primary attention is paid to the first S0 and A0 wave packets, which are significant due to their minimal interference from wave packet superposition and boundary reflections. Additionally, the S0 wave packet exhibits high sensitivity in detecting metal damage. Notably, the simulation signals demonstrate a high degree of similarity with the experimental signals, particularly in terms of the S0 and A0 wave packets. However, as time passes, due to the dispersion characteristics and boundary reflections of Lamb waves in practical structures, the received wave packets undergo superposition and mode conversion, leading to complexities in the signals following the first A0 wave packet. Where, \u0394A is the change in amplitude at different temperatures, \u0394 up is the change in phase velocity at various temperatures. is the amplitude of the Lamb wave signal at different temperatures, A T0 is the amplitude of the Lamb wave signal at \u221240 \xb0C. lp is the propagation distance of the Lamb wave.t Tem Lamb wave signals' propagation time at different temperatures is the propagation time of Lamb wave signals \u221240 \xb0C. From , and , it can be seen that the S0 mode waveforms of the simulated signal and the experimental signal are consistent. At temperatures ranging from \u221240 \xb0C to 80 \xb0C, the amplitude increases and the phase velocity decreases as the temperature increases. And in this paper, the mechanic-electric-thermal coupling simulation model is constructed by modeling the key parameters of the PZT dynamically, as well as considering the effect of thermal expansion stress. The results show that the changes of the simulated and experimental signals are consistent, and the maximum relative error of the amplitude is 4.01 % and the maximum relative error of the phase velocity is 3.86 %.
