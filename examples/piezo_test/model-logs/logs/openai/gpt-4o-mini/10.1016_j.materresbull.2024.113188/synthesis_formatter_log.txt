Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'Solid-state synthesis', 'precursors': ['BaCO3', 'TiO2', 'ZrO2', 'SnO2', 'HfO2'], 'steps': ['Weighed ingredients were added into alcohol.', 'Ball milled for 18 hours and dried in oven.', 'Calcined in a muffle furnace at 1100°C for 4 hours.', 'Ball milled for 24 hours and dried again.', 'Added 10 wt% of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to the powder with uniform mixing.', 'Pressed into a disc with a diameter of 10 mm and a thickness of 1 mm.', 'Debinding process in a muffle furnace at 650°C.', 'Sintering process at 1350°C for 2 hours.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'Raman Spectroscopy', 'SEM', 'EIS', 'XPS', 'UV Spectrophotometer', 'UV Diffuse Reflectance Spectrometer']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
