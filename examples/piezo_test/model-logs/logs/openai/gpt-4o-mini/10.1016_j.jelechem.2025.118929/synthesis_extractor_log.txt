Preparation of LiTaO3-Modified LiCoO2 (LTO-LCO) Samples: To prepare LTO-modified LCO samples with different LTO contents (0 wt%, 1 wt%, 2 wt%, and 3 wt%), we followed a specific procedure. Using the optimal coating ratio of LTO to pristine LCO in a 2:100 (2 wt% LTO-LCO) sample as an example, the steps are as follows: First, a certain molar mass of Ta2O5, CH3COOLi\xb72H2O, and C4H6O6 (C4H6O6 vs. cations = 2:3) were separately dissolved in ethanol. Then, the solution was mixed with commercial LCO powders (Guangdong Canrd New Energy Technology Co., Ltd) and vigorously stirred. The mixed solution was evaporated and stirred at 80 \xb0C until a sol was formed. The sol was aged at 120 \xb0C for 10 h to obtain a gel. The powder was annealed at 500 \xb0C for 12 h and then cooled to room temperature. To avoid the influence of the sintering temperature for LCO, the uncoated pristine LCO also underwent the same drying and annealing steps to minimize experimental errors. Preparation of pure LTO samples: The preparation of pure LTO samples was similar to the above experimental procedure, without adding LCO during the experiment. The LTO powders were then compacted into disk by uniaxial pressing in a stainless-steel die using polyvinyl butyral binder. The disk was sintered in air at 500 \xb0C for 3 h. In addition, the preparation of SrTiO3 (STO), MgTiO3 (MTO), STO-LCO, and MTO-LCO samples were described in. The crystal structure of LTO-coated LCO samples was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku SmartLab 9 kW). The morphology and composition of LTO and LCO samples before and after coating were analyzed using field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Gemini300) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, X-MaxE^{N} 50). The thickness of the samples before and after LTO coating was examined using field emission transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-F200). The elemental composition was investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB250). The disk samples were poled in silicon oil for 30 min. The piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) of the poled ceramics was measured using a quasistatic d 33 meter (ZJ-3A, Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China). The dielectric constant (\u03b5 r), capacitance (C), and dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) at 1 kHz of the LTO ceramics were measured using a precision LCR meter (E4990A, Keysight, Santa Clara, USA). The prepared sample powder was mixed with PVDF (as a binder) and conductive carbon black (as a conductive agent) in an 8:1:1 wt ratio. This blend was thoroughly ground, followed by dispersion in NMP to form a homogeneous slurry. The slurry was then evenly coated onto aluminum foil and dried at 100 \xb0C for 10 h. The dried foils were cut into circular discs of 8 mm diameter. Button cells (CR2032) were assembled in an argon-filled glove box, utilizing lithium foil as the counter electrode and a 2400 porous polypropylene film as the separator. The electrolyte consisted of 1 M LiPF6 solution in a 1:1:1 volumetric mixture of ethylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, and diethyl carbonate. Measurements on the batteries were conducted using the BlueSky testing system, with a current density range of 0.1 to 5 C (where 1 C is equivalent to 274 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121}), and a voltage span of 3.0 to 4.5 V versus Li/LiE^{+}. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out on a CHI660D electrochemical workstation at scanning rates of 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 mV\xb7sE^{\u22121}. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed on IM6, sweeping frequencies from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz with an amplitude of 5 mV.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The preparation procedure for LiTaO3-modified LiCoO2 (LTO-LCO) is illustrated in a, a simple sol\u2013gel method coupled with thermal treatment was utilized to coat LTO onto LCO uniformly. A modification mechanism was proposed based on the synergistic effect of physical isolation and piezoelectricity of the LTO coating layer on LCO. The lattice volume expansion of LCO accompanied the charging and discharging processes, then its stress was imparted onto LTO, leading to its piezoelectric polarization. To ascertain that the coating layer was indeed LTO, pure LTO powder was synthesized using the same preparation methodology employed in the fabrication of LTO-LCO. An XRD pattern with Rietveld refinement data (b) confirms that the synthesized material is pure LTO without other impurities. Characterization via Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), as illustrated in c, revealed that the LTO particles exhibited a uniform size distribution, with diameters averaging approximately 100 nm. The piezoelectric properties of pure LTO were also assessed, as summarized in a. LTO exhibits characteristic features of piezoelectric materials, with a piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) of 8 pC NE^{\u22121}, a dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) of 96.5, a capacitance (C) of 43 pF, and dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) of 0.06. b and 2c present the hysteresis loops of STO and MTO under diverse applied electric fields. For STO, the Pr value was approximately 0.26 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 1 kV/mm, rose to about 0.67 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 2 kV/mm, and reached around 1 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 3 kV/mm. Similarly, for MTO, the Pr value began at roughly 0.006 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 1 kV/mm, climbed to nearly 0.018 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 2 kV/mm, and trended towards 0.031 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 3 kV/mm. The XRD patterns of the synthetic sample powders with different coating contents were tested, as shown in a. No matter whether before and after coated LCO, the main diffraction peaks corresponding to (003), (101), and (104) planes indicate a hexagonal layered \u03b1-NaFeO2 structure with space group R-3 m (PDF#70\u20132685). The stable peak positions indicated that LTO modification did not alter the original crystal structure of LCO. Concurrently, as the LTO content increased, its diffraction peak became sharper, with a more pronounced differentiation of the (006)/(012) double peaks, indicating enhanced crystallinity and a more ordered layered structure. Rietveld refinement of the XRD shown in a and , and the refined data  confirm no apparent crystal change for LTO and LCO. S(2) of lattice mismatch, the lattice mismatch between LCO and LTO is as low as 2.13 %, indicating that the LTO coating layer and LCO material have excellent interface compatibility. SEM images (as depicted in b) reveal that the surface of the pristine LCO particle is smooth. In contrast, post-coating powders particles appeared on the surface of LCO grains, and the surface became coarser with the increased amount of coating layer. However, the particle size of LCO grains has no significant alteration, maintaining at approximately 5 \u03bcm, suggesting quite a thin LTO coating layer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to further investigate the thickness and uniformity of the coating layer across different content. As illustrated in c, the thickness of the coating layer shows a clear linear growth trend, increasing from 3.5 nm to 6.5 nm, and 10.5 nm with LTO coating amounts of 1 wt% to 3 wt%, respectively. In the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample (d), the interface structure between the LCO matrix and the LTO coating was displayed. Lattice fringes corresponding to the (012) plane with an average spacing of 0.23 nm were identified, while heteroepitaxial lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.21 nm were attributed to the (202) plane of LTO. The HRTEM image revealed excellent interfacial bonding between the LTO coating and the LCO matrix, with no noticeable interfacial defects or gaps observed. This tight interfacial bonding facilitated the stabilization of the electrode\u2013electrolyte interface, thereby promoting efficient LiE^{+} migration. Furthermore, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was performed on the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample, as shown in e, to reveal the uniform distribution of Ta, Co elements on the LCO surface. The uniform presence of Ta indicates that the LTO coating layer was uniformly deposited on the surface of the LCO particles. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to investigate the surface elemental composition and valence state distribution of LTO-LCO samples. The spectra were standardized using the C 1 s peak at 284.8 eV, as depicted in and. The full spectra of LCO, 1 wt%, 2 wt%, and 3 wt% LTO-LCO show five main peaks at about 55, 284, 531, 684, and 780 eV, as shown in a and S1a, which correspond to the Li 1 s, C 1 s, O 1 s, F 1 s, and Co 2p spectra, respectively. The peaks at approximately 27.5 and 25.6 eV likely originate from the Ta 4f5/2 and Ta 4f7/2 spin\u2013orbit doublet of the TaE^{5+} oxidation state in the LTO coating (as illustrated in b), which emerges only after the coating process. In c and S2b-c, the XPS spectra display the Co 2p region for LCO samples before and after LTO coating. The binding energies of Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 were located around 795 eV and 780 eV, respectively, indicating that the LTO coating layer did not induce rehybridization of the Co 2p orbitals, thus maintaining a relatively stable chemical environment for cobalt. In addition, d displays the O 1 s spectra of LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples after 100 cycles. As depicted, the three peaks between 528 eV and 535 eV reflect the lattice oxygen peak, the oxygen vacancy peak, and the adsorbed oxygen peak, respectively. The lattice oxygen contents for LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples were determined to be 38.57 % and 49.64 %, respectively. This suggests that the LTO layer inhibits the oxidation of lattice oxygen at high voltages, thereby stabilizing the crystal structure of LCO and suppressing the formation of byproducts on the surface of LCO particles. The content of the adsorbed oxygen peak located around 532 eV shows an apparent decrease after LTO coating. This means that the LTO layer can be used as a protective barrier to prevent the adsorption of oxygen molecules and thus reduce the degree of surface oxidation for the LCO cathode material. From the C 1 s spectrum in e, the content percentage of Li2CO3 peak reduced by 3.87 % from 15.59 % of LCO to 11.72 % of 2 wt% LTO-LCO. The COC peak content percentage decreased by 7.07 % from LCO to 2 wt% LTO-LCO. This may be attributed to effectively isolating the electrolyte from physical contact with LCO by the LTO coating layer, thereby reducing the alkaline content on the surface of LCO particles. As depicted in f, the F 1 s spectrum was divided into three peaks, corresponding to C-F, LiF, and LixPOyFz/LixPFy, respectively. From the pristine LCO to 2 wt% LTO-LCO, the LixPOyFz/LixPFy peak disappeared, and the LiF peak content also decreased. This also means that the LTO coating layer reduces the physical contact between the electrolyte and LCO, thereby decreasing the decomposition of the LiPF6 component. Herein, LTO as a coating layer can effectively inhibit the occurrence of side reactions. To investigate the impact of piezoelectric LTO coating layer for the electrochemical performance of LCO, the charge\u2013discharge process of LCO samples before and after LTO coating were evaluated within a voltage range of 3.0 to 4.5 V. a depicts the cycling performance and coulomb efficiency curves of pristine LCO, 1 wt%, 2 wt%, and 3 wt% LTO-LCO samples at 0.1 C. The pristine LCO sample deteriorated at the 142nd cycle. The charge\u2013discharge cycles lead to repeated expansion and contraction of the crystal structure of LCO samples, which causes the accumulation of mechanical stress in LCO, resulting in capacity fade. As shown in , the surfaces of the original LCO grains were affected by cracks caused by stress resulting from long-term cycling. In contrast, the LCO grains coated with LTO exhibited a significant reduction in stress-induced expansion. In the TEM image of the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample after long-term cycling , the interface structure between the LCO matrix and the LTO coating was displayed. Excellent interfacial bonding between the LTO coating and the LCO matrix was observed, with no noticeable interfacial defects or gaps. The results show that the LTO coating is not damaged by the stress during the long-term cycle and maintains good integrity. After 200 cycles, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample maintained a high discharge specific capacity of 172.8 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} and a good capacity retention rate of 84.8 %. In addition, as illustrated in b, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample testing at different rates also exhibited the highest discharge-specific capacities compared with the reference samples. For example, it maintained a capacity of 135.8 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} at a rate of 5 C and a capacity of 194.5 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} with the rate restored from 5 C to 0.1 C (97.3 % capacity retention rate). c displays the first charge\u2013discharge curves for all testing samples. It can be observed that the use of the LTO coating layer can improve the initial Coulombic efficiency of the LCO electrode. The 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample exhibited a high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 76.73 %, significantly surpassing the pristine LCO (28.46 %). As can be observed from d and 5e, and e and S3f, voltage decay occurred as the number of cycles increased, related to the structural phase transitions and interfacial side reactions of LCO. During the charging process, an ordered-to-disordered transition occurred in the LCO samples when the voltage reached approximately 4.2 V, leading to fluctuations of the voltage drop in the charging curve. At a charging voltage of 4.5 V, a phase transition from the O3 phase to the H1-3 phase occurred, causing a capacity fade in the LCO samples. It can be observed that the pristine LCO sample exhibited fluctuations in the curve at positions of 4.10 and 4.18 V, while these fluctuations gradually disappeared for LTO coating samples. In addition, g-h and a-b present the first three cycles of CV curves for the four samples. It can be observed that the pristine LCO sample exhibited fluctuations in the curve at 4.18 V, whereas the LTO-coated samples did not show this phenomenon. The redox peaks remained unchanged, indicating that the LTO coating layer did not alter the structure of LCO, effectively extending the cycling life of LCO. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of LTO-LCO electrodes were conducted to further analyze the impact of the LTO coating layer on LiE^{+} diffusion kinetics. a-b and S3c-d present the CV curves at the 0th, 3rd, 50th, and 100th cycles for LTO-LCO electrode testing at a scan rate of 0.2 mV\xb7sE^{\u22121}. For pristine LCO electrodes, the intensity of the redox peaks decreased sharply, and the half-widths increased gradually with the increase of cycle numbers. However, for the 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrode, the intensity of the redox peaks strengthened, and the half-widths narrowed with the rise in cycle numbers. Furthermore, the CV curves were obtained with scan rates from 0.3 to 0.6 mV\xb7sE^{\u22121} within the 3.0\u20134.5 V voltage range, as illustrated in c-d, and g-h. For both of pristine LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrodes, their redox peak potentials shifted to both sides with the increased scan rates, indicating the polarization phenomenon of the battery. The linear relationship between the scan rate and the peak current in the CV curves was fitted by the Randles-Sevcik equation. As illustrated in e-f, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrode shows the highest slope among all the samples. Then the lithium-ion diffusion coefficients (DLi+) corresponding to the redox peaks of LTO-LCO electrodes were calculated using eq. S(3) , as depicted in g. The detailed DLi+ values are shown in and the 2 wt%LTO-LCO electrode exhibits the highest DLi+. Although the LTO coating layer does not provide battery electrode capacity, it enhances the LiE^{+} diffusion coefficient. h-i depict the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) for LTO-LCO electrode testing at the first and the 200 cycles. The 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples exhibited the smallest solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) impedances (Rsf) for both the first and the 200 cycles, indicating the lowest impedance for LiE^{+} transport through the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). This suggests that the LTO coating layer reduced the direct contact between the LCO material and the electrolyte, thereby decreasing the occurrence of side reactions. Interestingly, the impedance values of 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples decreased gradually with cycle counts from the first to 200 cycles , which may be attributed to the fact that the piezoelectric properties of the LTO coating layer accelerated the diffusion rate of LiE^{+} at the electrolyte interface and formed a more stable and reliable electrolyte interface. The XPS spectra of the Bare LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples after 100 cycles are shown in. It was demonstrated that the LTO coating significantly suppressed the generation of side reactions at the electrode interface and the decomposition of the electrolyte. This effect facilitated easier LiE^{+} migration, thereby validating the role of LTO in regulating LiE^{+} behavior. In addition, low-temperature STO and MTO were studied as coatings for LCO electrodes. S(2) (see ), the lattice mismatch between MTO and LCO is small, while the lattice mismatch between STO and LCO is large. However, TEM analysis shows that STO and MTO cover the LCO interface, as shown in. The increase in electrochemical performance verifies the general applicability of ferroelectric coatings in converting the stresses generated during the LCO high-voltage charging-discharge cycle into polarized fields, thereby increasing the diffusion rate of LiE^{+}. shows the cycling and rate performance curves of STO-LCO and MTO-LCO electrodes with different contents as coating layers, tested in the voltage range of 3.0\u20134.5 V. The cycling and rate performance of the LCO electrodes were significantly improved after being coated with 1 wt% STO and MTO materials. This confirmed the general applicability of these materials in improving the performance of LCO. However, the performance of the LCO electrodes coated with LTO was even higher, indicating that while both STO and MTO coatings could improve the electrochemical performance of LCO, the LTO coating exhibited superior performance in terms of cycle stability and rate capability. The improved performance of the LTO-coated LCO can be attributed to its stronger spontaneous polarization and better piezoelectric properties, which more effectively converted the stress generated during high-pressure charging and discharging into a polarizing electric field. By studying the theoretical and experimental results in the existing literature , we propose a mechanism to explain how LTO coatings improve the electrochemical properties of the positive electrode of LCO. The modification mechanism of piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings on LCO electrodes is illustrated in. During the charge\u2013discharge cycles, the insertion and extraction of LiE^{+} ions caused lattice expansion and a series of phase transitions in the LCO electrode, leading to stress\u2013strain accumulation. During the charging process, the extraction of lithium ions induced lattice expansion in the LCO electrode, generating stress that was subsequently transferred to the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings. These coatings then produced polarization fields opposite the direction of the stress and the LiE^{+} transport direction, preventing overcharging of the LCO electrode. In the discharging process, the stress on the coatings began to decrease, causing the polarization fields to align with the external electric field, which facilitated the insertion of LiE^{+} into the LCO electrode. At this stage, the polarization field acts as an accelerator for LiE^{+}, thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance of LCO. In summary, since the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings do not contribute to charge\u2013discharge capacity, the enhancement of the LCO electrode's electrochemical performance can be attributed to: 1) the reduction of physical contact between LCO and the electrolyte by the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings, thereby reducing the occurrence of interfacial side reactions; 2) the formation of a polarization field by the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings, which regulates the insertion and extraction of LiE^{+} during cycling, thus suppressing the ordered-to-disordered phase transition and mitigating the structural degradation of LCO.

The peaks at approximately 27.5 and 25.6 eV likely originate from the Ta 4f5/2 and Ta 4f7/2 spin\u2013orbit doublet of the TaE^{5+} oxidation state in the LTO coating (as illustrated in b), which emerges only after the coating process. In c and S2b-c, the XPS spectra display the Co 2p region for LCO samples before and after LTO coating. The binding energies of Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 were located around 795 eV and 780 eV, respectively, indicating that the LTO coating layer did not induce rehybridization of the Co 2p orbitals, thus maintaining a relatively stable chemical environment for cobalt. In addition, d displays the O 1 s spectra of LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples after 100 cycles. As depicted, the three peaks between 528 eV and 535 eV reflect the lattice oxygen peak, the oxygen vacancy peak, and the adsorbed oxygen peak, respectively. The lattice oxygen contents for LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples were determined to be 38.57 % and 49.64 %, respectively. This suggests that the LTO layer inhibits the oxidation of lattice oxygen at high voltages, thereby stabilizing the crystal structure of LCO and suppressing the formation of byproducts on the surface of LCO particles. The content of the adsorbed oxygen peak located around 532 eV shows an apparent decrease after LTO coating. This means that the LTO layer can be used as a protective barrier to prevent the adsorption of oxygen molecules and thus reduce the degree of surface oxidation for the LCO cathode material. From the C 1 s spectrum in e, the content percentage of Li2CO3 peak reduced by 3.87 % from 15.59 % of LCO to 11.72 % of 2 wt% LTO-LCO. The COC peak content percentage decreased by 7.07 % from LCO to 2 wt% LTO-LCO. This may be attributed to effectively isolating the electrolyte from physical contact with LCO by the LTO coating layer, thereby reducing the alkaline content on the surface of LCO particles. As depicted in f, the F 1 s spectrum was divided into three peaks, corresponding to C-F, LiF, and LixPOyFz/LixPFy, respectively. From the pristine LCO to 2 wt% LTO-LCO, the LixPOyFz/LixPFy peak disappeared, and the LiF peak content also decreased. This also means that the LTO coating layer reduces the physical contact between the electrolyte and LCO, thereby decreasing the decomposition of the LiPF6 component. Herein, LTO as a coating layer can effectively inhibit the occurrence of side reactions. To investigate the impact of piezoelectric LTO coating layer for the electrochemical performance of LCO, the charge\u2013discharge process of LCO samples before and after LTO coating were evaluated within a voltage range of 3.0 to 4.5 V. a depicts the cycling performance and coulomb efficiency curves of pristine LCO, 1 wt%, 2 wt%, and 3 wt% LTO-LCO samples at 0.1 C. The pristine LCO sample deteriorated at the 142nd cycle. The charge\u2013discharge cycles lead to repeated expansion and contraction of the crystal structure of LCO samples, which causes the accumulation of mechanical stress in LCO, resulting in capacity fade. As shown in , the surfaces of the original LCO grains were affected by cracks caused by stress resulting from long-term cycling. In contrast, the LCO grains coated with LTO exhibited a significant reduction in stress-induced expansion. In the TEM image of the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample after long-term cycling , the interface structure between the LCO matrix and the LTO coating was displayed. Excellent interfacial bonding between the LTO coating and the LCO matrix was observed, with no noticeable interfacial defects or gaps. The results show that the LTO coating is not damaged by the stress during the long-term cycle and maintains good integrity. After 200 cycles, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample maintained a high discharge specific capacity of 172.8 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} and a good capacity retention rate of 84.8 %. In addition, as illustrated in b, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample testing at different rates also exhibited the highest discharge-specific capacities compared with the reference samples. For example, it maintained a capacity of 135.8 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} at a rate of 5 C and a capacity of 194.5 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} with the rate restored from 5 C to 0.1 C (97.3 % capacity retention rate). c displays the first charge\u2013discharge curves for all testing samples. It can be observed that the use of the LTO coating layer can improve the initial Coulombic efficiency of the LCO electrode. The 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample exhibited a high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 76.73 %, significantly surpassing the pristine LCO (28.46 %). As can be observed from d and 5e, and e and S3f, voltage decay occurred as the number of cycles increased, related to the structural phase transitions and interfacial side reactions of LCO. During the charging process, an ordered-to-disordered transition occurred in the LCO samples when the voltage reached approximately 4.2 V, leading to fluctuations of the voltage drop in the charging curve. At a charging voltage of 4.5 V, a phase transition from the O3 phase to the H1-3 phase occurred, causing a capacity fade in the LCO samples. It can be observed that the pristine LCO sample exhibited fluctuations in the curve at positions of 4.10 and 4.18 V, while these fluctuations gradually disappeared for LTO coating samples. In addition, g-h and a-b present the first three cycles of CV curves for the four samples. It can be observed that the pristine LCO sample exhibited fluctuations in the curve at 4.18 V, whereas the LTO-coated samples did not show this phenomenon. The redox peaks remained unchanged, indicating that the LTO coating layer did not alter the structure of LCO, effectively extending the cycling life of LCO. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of LTO-LCO electrodes were conducted to further analyze the impact of the LTO coating layer on LiE^{+} diffusion kinetics. a-b and S3c-d present the CV curves at the 0th, 3rd, 50th, and 100th cycles for LTO-LCO electrode testing at a scan rate of 0.2 mV\xb7sE^{\u22121}. For pristine LCO electrodes, the intensity of the redox peaks decreased sharply, and the half-widths increased gradually with the increase of cycle numbers. However, for the 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrode, the intensity of the redox peaks strengthened, and the half-widths narrowed with the rise in cycle numbers. Furthermore, the CV curves were obtained with scan rates from 0.3 to 0.6 mV\xb7sE^{\u22121} within the 3.0\u20134.5 V voltage range, as illustrated in c-d, and g-h. For both of pristine LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrodes, their redox peak potentials shifted to both sides with the increased scan rates, indicating the polarization phenomenon of the battery. The linear relationship between the scan rate and the peak current in the CV curves was fitted by the Randles-Sevcik equation. As illustrated in e-f, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrode shows the highest slope among all the samples. Then the lithium-ion diffusion coefficients (DLi+) corresponding to the redox peaks of LTO-LCO electrodes were calculated using eq. S(3) , as depicted in g. The detailed DLi+ values are shown in and the 2 wt%LTO-LCO electrode exhibits the highest DLi+. Although the LTO coating layer does not provide battery electrode capacity, it enhances the LiE^{+} diffusion coefficient. h-i depict the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) for LTO-LCO electrode testing at the first and the 200 cycles. The 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples exhibited the smallest solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) impedances (Rsf) for both the first and the 200 cycles, indicating the lowest impedance for LiE^{+} transport through the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). This suggests that the LTO coating layer reduced the direct contact between the LCO material and the electrolyte, thereby decreasing the occurrence of side reactions. Interestingly, the impedance values of 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples decreased gradually with cycle counts from the first to 200 cycles , which may be attributed to the fact that the piezoelectric properties of the LTO coating layer accelerated the diffusion rate of LiE^{+} at the electrolyte interface and formed a more stable and reliable electrolyte interface. The XPS spectra of the Bare LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples after 100 cycles are shown in. It was demonstrated that the LTO coating significantly suppressed the generation of side reactions at the electrode interface and the decomposition of the electrolyte. This effect facilitated easier LiE^{+} migration, thereby validating the role of LTO in regulating LiE^{+} behavior. In addition, low-temperature STO and MTO were studied as coatings for LCO electrodes. S(2) (see ), the lattice mismatch between MTO and LCO is small, while the lattice mismatch between STO and LCO is large. However, TEM analysis shows that STO and MTO cover the LCO interface, as shown in. The increase in electrochemical performance verifies the general applicability of ferroelectric coatings in converting the stresses generated during the LCO high-voltage charging-discharge cycle into polarized fields, thereby increasing the diffusion rate of LiE^{+}. shows the cycling and rate performance curves of STO-LCO and MTO-LCO electrodes with different contents as coating layers, tested in the voltage range of 3.0\u20134.5 V. The cycling and rate performance of the LCO electrodes were significantly improved after being coated with 1 wt% STO and MTO materials. This confirmed the general applicability of these materials in improving the performance of LCO. However, the performance of the LCO electrodes coated with LTO was even higher, indicating that while both STO and MTO coatings could improve the electrochemical performance of LCO, the LTO coating exhibited superior performance in terms of cycle stability and rate capability. The improved performance of the LTO-coated LCO can be attributed to its stronger spontaneous polarization and better piezoelectric properties, which more effectively converted the stress generated during high-pressure charging and discharging into a polarizing electric field. By studying the theoretical and experimental results in the existing literature , we propose a mechanism to explain how LTO coatings improve the electrochemical properties of the positive electrode of LCO. The modification mechanism of piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings on LCO electrodes is illustrated in. During the charge\u2013discharge cycles, the insertion and extraction of LiE^{+} ions caused lattice expansion and a series of phase transitions in the LCO electrode, leading to stress\u2013strain accumulation. During the charging process, the extraction of lithium ions induced lattice expansion in the LCO electrode, generating stress that was subsequently transferred to the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings. These coatings then produced polarization fields opposite the direction of the stress and the LiE^{+} transport direction, preventing overcharging of the LCO electrode. In the discharging process, the stress on the coatings began to decrease, causing the polarization fields to align with the external electric field, which facilitated the insertion of LiE^{+} into the LCO electrode. At this stage, the polarization field acts as an accelerator for LiE^{+}, thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance of LCO. In summary, since the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings do not contribute to charge\u2013discharge capacity, the enhancement of the LCO electrode's electrochemical performance can be attributed to: 1) the reduction of physical contact between LCO and the electrolyte by the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings, thereby reducing the occurrence of interfacial side reactions; 2) the formation of a polarization field by the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings, which regulates the insertion and extraction of LiE^{+} during cycling, thus suppressing the ordered-to-disordered phase transition and mitigating the structural degradation of LCO.

Preparation of LiTaO3-Modified LiCoO2 (LTO-LCO) Samples: To prepare LTO-modified LCO samples with different LTO contents (0 wt%, 1 wt%, 2 wt%, and 3 wt%), we followed a specific procedure. Using the optimal coating ratio of LTO to pristine LCO in a 2:100 (2 wt% LTO-LCO) sample as an example, the steps are as follows: First, a certain molar mass of Ta2O5, CH3COOLi\xb72H2O, and C4H6O6 (C4H6O6 vs. cations = 2:3) were separately dissolved in ethanol. Then, the solution was mixed with commercial LCO powders (Guangdong Canrd New Energy Technology Co., Ltd) and vigorously stirred. The mixed solution was evaporated and stirred at 80 \xb0C until a sol was formed. The sol was aged at 120 \xb0C for 10 h to obtain a gel. The powder was annealed at 500 \xb0C for 12 h and then cooled to room temperature. To avoid the influence of the sintering temperature for LCO, the uncoated pristine LCO also underwent the same drying and annealing steps to minimize experimental errors. Preparation of pure LTO samples: The preparation of pure LTO samples was similar to the above experimental procedure, without adding LCO during the experiment. The LTO powders were then compacted into disk by uniaxial pressing in a stainless-steel die using polyvinyl butyral binder. The disk was sintered in air at 500 \xb0C for 3 h. In addition, the preparation of SrTiO3 (STO), MgTiO3 (MTO), STO-LCO, and MTO-LCO samples were described in. The crystal structure of LTO-coated LCO samples was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku SmartLab 9 kW). The morphology and composition of LTO and LCO samples before and after coating were analyzed using field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Gemini300) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, X-MaxE^{N} 50). The thickness of the samples before and after LTO coating was examined using field emission transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-F200). The elemental composition was investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB250). The disk samples were poled in silicon oil for 30 min. The piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) of the poled ceramics was measured using a quasistatic d 33 meter (ZJ-3A, Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China). The dielectric constant (\u03b5 r), capacitance (C), and dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) at 1 kHz of the LTO ceramics were measured using a precision LCR meter (E4990A, Keysight, Santa Clara, USA). The prepared sample powder was mixed with PVDF (as a binder) and conductive carbon black (as a conductive agent) in an 8:1:1 wt ratio. This blend was thoroughly ground, followed by dispersion in NMP to form a homogeneous slurry. The slurry was then evenly coated onto aluminum foil and dried at 100 \xb0C for 10 h. The dried foils were cut into circular discs of 8 mm diameter. Button cells (CR2032) were assembled in an argon-filled glove box, utilizing lithium foil as the counter electrode and a 2400 porous polypropylene film as the separator. The electrolyte consisted of 1 M LiPF6 solution in a 1:1:1 volumetric mixture of ethylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, and diethyl carbonate. Measurements on the batteries were conducted using the BlueSky testing system, with a current density range of 0.1 to 5 C (where 1 C is equivalent to 274 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121}), and a voltage span of 3.0 to 4.5 V versus Li/LiE^{+}. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out on a CHI660D electrochemical workstation at scanning rates of 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 mV\xb7sE^{\u22121}. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed on IM6, sweeping frequencies from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz with an amplitude of 5 mV.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The preparation procedure for LiTaO3-modified LiCoO2 (LTO-LCO) is illustrated in a, a simple sol\u2013gel method coupled with thermal treatment was utilized to coat LTO onto LCO uniformly. A modification mechanism was proposed based on the synergistic effect of physical isolation and piezoelectricity of the LTO coating layer on LCO. The lattice volume expansion of LCO accompanied the charging and discharging processes, then its stress was imparted onto LTO, leading to its piezoelectric polarization. To ascertain that the coating layer was indeed LTO, pure LTO powder was synthesized using the same preparation methodology employed in the fabrication of LTO-LCO. An XRD pattern with Rietveld refinement data (b) confirms that the synthesized material is pure LTO without other impurities. Characterization via Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), as illustrated in c, revealed that the LTO particles exhibited a uniform size distribution, with diameters averaging approximately 100 nm. The piezoelectric properties of pure LTO were also assessed, as summarized in a. LTO exhibits characteristic features of piezoelectric materials, with a piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) of 8 pC NE^{\u22121}, a dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) of 96.5, a capacitance (C) of 43 pF, and dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) of 0.06. b and 2c present the hysteresis loops of STO and MTO under diverse applied electric fields. For STO, the Pr value was approximately 0.26 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 1 kV/mm, rose to about 0.67 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 2 kV/mm, and reached around 1 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 3 kV/mm. Similarly, for MTO, the Pr value began at roughly 0.006 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 1 kV/mm, climbed to nearly 0.018 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 2 kV/mm, and trended towards 0.031 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 3 kV/mm. The XRD patterns of the synthetic sample powders with different coating contents were tested, as shown in a. No matter whether before and after coated LCO, the main diffraction peaks corresponding to (003), (101), and (104) planes indicate a hexagonal layered \u03b1-NaFeO2 structure with space group R-3 m (PDF#70\u20132685). The stable peak positions indicated that LTO modification did not alter the original crystal structure of LCO. Concurrently, as the LTO content increased, its diffraction peak became sharper, with a more pronounced differentiation of the (006)/(012) double peaks, indicating enhanced crystallinity and a more ordered layered structure. Rietveld refinement of the XRD shown in a and , and the refined data  confirm no apparent crystal change for LTO and LCO. S(2) of lattice mismatch, the lattice mismatch between LCO and LTO is as low as 2.13 %, indicating that the LTO coating layer and LCO material have excellent interface compatibility. SEM images (as depicted in b) reveal that the surface of the pristine LCO particle is smooth. In contrast, post-coating powders particles appeared on the surface of LCO grains, and the surface became coarser with the increased amount of coating layer. However, the particle size of LCO grains has no significant alteration, maintaining at approximately 5 \u03bcm, suggesting quite a thin LTO coating layer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to further investigate the thickness and uniformity of the coating layer across different content. As illustrated in c, the thickness of the coating layer shows a clear linear growth trend, increasing from 3.5 nm to 6.5 nm, and 10.5 nm with LTO coating amounts of 1 wt% to 3 wt%, respectively. In the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample (d), the interface structure between the LCO matrix and the LTO coating was displayed. Lattice fringes corresponding to the (012) plane with an average spacing of 0.23 nm were identified, while heteroepitaxial lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.21 nm were attributed to the (202) plane of LTO. The HRTEM image revealed excellent interfacial bonding between the LTO coating and the LCO matrix, with no noticeable interfacial defects or gaps observed. This tight interfacial bonding facilitated the stabilization of the electrode\u2013electrolyte interface, thereby promoting efficient LiE^{+} migration. Furthermore, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was performed on the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample, as shown in e, to reveal the uniform distribution of Ta, Co elements on the LCO surface. The uniform presence of Ta indicates that the LTO coating layer was uniformly deposited on the surface of the LCO particles. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to investigate the surface elemental composition and valence state distribution of LTO-LCO samples. The spectra were standardized using the C 1 s peak at 284.8 eV, as depicted in and. The full spectra of LCO, 1 wt%, 2 wt%, and 3 wt% LTO-LCO show five main peaks at about 55, 284, 531, 684, and 780 eV, as shown in a and S1a, which correspond to the Li 1 s, C 1 s, O 1 s, F 1 s, and Co 2p spectra, respectively. The peaks at approximately 27.5 and 25.6 eV likely originate from the Ta 4f5/2 and Ta 4f7/2 spin\u2013orbit doublet of the TaE^{5+} oxidation state in the LTO coating (as illustrated in b), which emerges only after the coating process. In c and S2b-c, the XPS spectra display the Co 2p region for LCO samples before and after LTO coating. The binding energies of Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 were located around 795 eV and 780 eV, respectively, indicating that the LTO coating layer did not induce rehybridization of the Co 2p orbitals, thus maintaining a relatively stable chemical environment for cobalt. In addition, d displays the O 1 s spectra of LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples after 100 cycles. As depicted, the three peaks between 528 eV and 535 eV reflect the lattice oxygen peak, the oxygen vacancy peak, and the adsorbed oxygen peak, respectively. The lattice oxygen contents for LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples were determined to be 38.57 % and 49.64 %, respectively. This suggests that the LTO layer inhibits the oxidation of lattice oxygen at high voltages, thereby stabilizing the crystal structure of LCO and suppressing the formation of byproducts on the surface of LCO particles. The content of the adsorbed oxygen peak located around 532 eV shows an apparent decrease after LTO coating. This means that the LTO layer can be used as a protective barrier to prevent the adsorption of oxygen molecules and thus reduce the degree of surface oxidation for the LCO cathode material. From the C 1 s spectrum in e, the content percentage of Li2CO3 peak reduced by 3.87 % from 15.59 % of LCO to 11.72 % of 2 wt% LTO-LCO. The COC peak content percentage decreased by 7.07 % from LCO to 2 wt% LTO-LCO. This may be attributed to effectively isolating the electrolyte from physical contact with LCO by the LTO coating layer, thereby reducing the alkaline content on the surface of LCO particles. As depicted in f, the F 1 s spectrum was divided into three peaks, corresponding to C-F, LiF, and LixPOyFz/LixPFy, respectively. From the pristine LCO to 2 wt% LTO-LCO, the LixPOyFz/LixPFy peak disappeared, and the LiF peak content also decreased. This also means that the LTO coating layer reduces the physical contact between the electrolyte and LCO, thereby decreasing the decomposition of the LiPF6 component. Herein, LTO as a coating layer can effectively inhibit the occurrence of side reactions. To investigate the impact of piezoelectric LTO coating layer for the electrochemical performance of LCO, the charge\u2013discharge process of LCO samples before and after LTO coating were evaluated within a voltage range of 3.0 to 4.5 V. a depicts the cycling performance and coulomb efficiency curves of pristine LCO, 1 wt%, 2 wt%, and 3 wt% LTO-LCO samples at 0.1 C. The pristine LCO sample deteriorated at the 142nd cycle. The charge\u2013discharge cycles lead to repeated expansion and contraction of the crystal structure of LCO samples, which causes the accumulation of mechanical stress in LCO, resulting in capacity fade. As shown in , the surfaces of the original LCO grains were affected by cracks caused by stress resulting from long-term cycling. In contrast, the LCO grains coated with LTO exhibited a significant reduction in stress-induced expansion. In the TEM image of the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample after long-term cycling , the interface structure between the LCO matrix and the LTO coating was displayed. Excellent interfacial bonding between the LTO coating and the LCO matrix was observed, with no noticeable interfacial defects or gaps. The results show that the LTO coating is not damaged by the stress during the long-term cycle and maintains good integrity. After 200 cycles, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample maintained a high discharge specific capacity of 172.8 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} and a good capacity retention rate of 84.8 %. In addition, as illustrated in b, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample testing at different rates also exhibited the highest discharge-specific capacities compared with the reference samples. For example, it maintained a capacity of 135.8 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} at a rate of 5 C and a capacity of 194.5 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} with the rate restored from 5 C to 0.1 C (97.3 % capacity retention rate). c displays the first charge\u2013discharge curves for all testing samples. It can be observed that the use of the LTO coating layer can improve the initial Coulombic efficiency of the LCO electrode. The 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample exhibited a high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 76.73 %, significantly surpassing the pristine LCO (28.46 %). As can be observed from d and 5e, and e and S3f, voltage decay occurred as the number of cycles increased, related to the structural phase transitions and interfacial side reactions of LCO. During the charging process, an ordered-to-disordered transition occurred in the LCO samples when the voltage reached approximately 4.2 V, leading to fluctuations of the voltage drop in the charging curve. At a charging voltage of 4.5 V, a phase transition from the O3 phase to the H1-3 phase occurred, causing a capacity fade in the LCO samples. It can be observed that the pristine LCO sample exhibited fluctuations in the curve at positions of 4.10 and 4.18 V, while these fluctuations gradually disappeared for LTO coating samples. In addition, g-h and a-b present the first three cycles of CV curves for the four samples. It can be observed that the pristine LCO sample exhibited fluctuations in the curve at 4.18 V, whereas the LTO-coated samples did not show this phenomenon. The redox peaks remained unchanged, indicating that the LTO coating layer did not alter the structure of LCO, effectively extending the cycling life of LCO. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of LTO-LCO electrodes were conducted to further analyze the impact of the LTO coating layer on LiE^{+} diffusion kinetics. a-b and S3c-d present the CV curves at the 0th, 3rd, 50th, and 100th cycles for LTO-LCO electrode testing at a scan rate of 0.2 mV\xb7sE^{\u22121}. For pristine LCO electrodes, the intensity of the redox peaks decreased sharply, and the half-widths increased gradually with the increase of cycle numbers. However, for the 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrode, the intensity of the redox peaks strengthened, and the half-widths narrowed with the rise in cycle numbers. Furthermore, the CV curves were obtained with scan rates from 0.3 to 0.6 mV\xb7sE^{\u22121} within the 3.0\u20134.5 V voltage range, as illustrated in c-d, and g-h. For both of pristine LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrodes, their redox peak potentials shifted to both sides with the increased scan rates, indicating the polarization phenomenon of the battery. The linear relationship between the scan rate and the peak current in the CV curves was fitted by the Randles-Sevcik equation. As illustrated in e-f, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrode shows the highest slope among all the samples. Then the lithium-ion diffusion coefficients (DLi+) corresponding to the redox peaks of LTO-LCO electrodes were calculated using eq. S(3) , as depicted in g. The detailed DLi+ values are shown in and the 2 wt%LTO-LCO electrode exhibits the highest DLi+. Although the LTO coating layer does not provide battery electrode capacity, it enhances the LiE^{+} diffusion coefficient. h-i depict the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) for LTO-LCO electrode testing at the first and the 200 cycles. The 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples exhibited the smallest solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) impedances (Rsf) for both the first and the 200 cycles, indicating the lowest impedance for LiE^{+} transport through the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). This suggests that the LTO coating layer reduced the direct contact between the LCO material and the electrolyte, thereby decreasing the occurrence of side reactions. Interestingly, the impedance values of 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples decreased gradually with cycle counts from the first to 200 cycles , which may be attributed to the fact that the piezoelectric properties of the LTO coating layer accelerated the diffusion rate of LiE^{+} at the electrolyte interface and formed a more stable and reliable electrolyte interface. The XPS spectra of the Bare LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples after 100 cycles are shown in. It was demonstrated that the LTO coating significantly suppressed the generation of side reactions at the electrode interface and the decomposition of the electrolyte. This effect facilitated easier LiE^{+} migration, thereby validating the role of LTO in regulating LiE^{+} behavior. In addition, low-temperature STO and MTO were studied as coatings for LCO electrodes. S(2) (see ), the lattice mismatch between MTO and LCO is small, while the lattice mismatch between STO and LCO is large. However, TEM analysis shows that STO and MTO cover the LCO interface, as shown in. The increase in electrochemical performance verifies the general applicability of ferroelectric coatings in converting the stresses generated during the LCO high-voltage charging-discharge cycle into polarized fields, thereby increasing the diffusion rate of LiE^{+}. shows the cycling and rate performance curves of STO-LCO and MTO-LCO electrodes with different contents as coating layers, tested in the voltage range of 3.0\u20134.5 V. The cycling and rate performance of the LCO electrodes were significantly improved after being coated with 1 wt% STO and MTO materials. This confirmed the general applicability of these materials in improving the performance of LCO. However, the performance of the LCO electrodes coated with LTO was even higher, indicating that while both STO and MTO coatings could improve the electrochemical performance of LCO, the LTO coating exhibited superior performance in terms of cycle stability and rate capability. The improved performance of the LTO-coated LCO can be attributed to its stronger spontaneous polarization and better piezoelectric properties, which more effectively converted the stress generated during high-pressure charging and discharging into a polarizing electric field. By studying the theoretical and experimental results in the existing literature , we propose a mechanism to explain how LTO coatings improve the electrochemical properties of the positive electrode of LCO. The modification mechanism of piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings on LCO electrodes is illustrated in. During the charge\u2013discharge cycles, the insertion and extraction of LiE^{+} ions caused lattice expansion and a series of phase transitions in the LCO electrode, leading to stress\u2013strain accumulation. During the charging process, the extraction of lithium ions induced lattice expansion in the LCO electrode, generating stress that was subsequently transferred to the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings. These coatings then produced polarization fields opposite the direction of the stress and the LiE^{+} transport direction, preventing overcharging of the LCO electrode. In the discharging process, the stress on the coatings began to decrease, causing the polarization fields to align with the external electric field, which facilitated the insertion of LiE^{+} into the LCO electrode. At this stage, the polarization field acts as an accelerator for LiE^{+}, thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance of LCO. In summary, since the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings do not contribute to charge\u2013discharge capacity, the enhancement of the LCO electrode's electrochemical performance can be attributed to: 1) the reduction of physical contact between LCO and the electrolyte by the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings, thereby reducing the occurrence of interfacial side reactions; 2) the formation of a polarization field by the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings, which regulates the insertion and extraction of LiE^{+} during cycling, thus suppressing the ordered-to-disordered phase transition and mitigating the structural degradation of LCO.

Preparation of LiTaO3-Modified LiCoO2 (LTO-LCO) Samples: To prepare LTO-modified LCO samples with different LTO contents (0 wt%, 1 wt%, 2 wt%, and 3 wt%), we followed a specific procedure. Using the optimal coating ratio of LTO to pristine LCO in a 2:100 (2 wt% LTO-LCO) sample as an example, the steps are as follows: First, a certain molar mass of Ta2O5, CH3COOLi\xb72H2O, and C4H6O6 (C4H6O6 vs. cations = 2:3) were separately dissolved in ethanol. Then, the solution was mixed with commercial LCO powders (Guangdong Canrd New Energy Technology Co., Ltd) and vigorously stirred. The mixed solution was evaporated and stirred at 80 \xb0C until a sol was formed. The sol was aged at 120 \xb0C for 10 h to obtain a gel. The powder was annealed at 500 \xb0C for 12 h and then cooled to room temperature. To avoid the influence of the sintering temperature for LCO, the uncoated pristine LCO also underwent the same drying and annealing steps to minimize experimental errors. Preparation of pure LTO samples: The preparation of pure LTO samples was similar to the above experimental procedure, without adding LCO during the experiment. The LTO powders were then compacted into disk by uniaxial pressing in a stainless-steel die using polyvinyl butyral binder. The disk was sintered in air at 500 \xb0C for 3 h. In addition, the preparation of SrTiO3 (STO), MgTiO3 (MTO), STO-LCO, and MTO-LCO samples were described in. The crystal structure of LTO-coated LCO samples was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku SmartLab 9 kW). The morphology and composition of LTO and LCO samples before and after coating were analyzed using field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Gemini300) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, X-MaxE^{N} 50). The thickness of the samples before and after LTO coating was examined using field emission transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-F200). The elemental composition was investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB250). The disk samples were poled in silicon oil for 30 min. The piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) of the poled ceramics was measured using a quasistatic d 33 meter (ZJ-3A, Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China). The dielectric constant (\u03b5 r), capacitance (C), and dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) at 1 kHz of the LTO ceramics were measured using a precision LCR meter (E4990A, Keysight, Santa Clara, USA). The prepared sample powder was mixed with PVDF (as a binder) and conductive carbon black (as a conductive agent) in an 8:1:1 wt ratio. This blend was thoroughly ground, followed by dispersion in NMP to form a homogeneous slurry. The slurry was then evenly coated onto aluminum foil and dried at 100 \xb0C for 10 h. The dried foils were cut into circular discs of 8 mm diameter. Button cells (CR2032) were assembled in an argon-filled glove box, utilizing lithium foil as the counter electrode and a 2400 porous polypropylene film as the separator. The electrolyte consisted of 1 M LiPF6 solution in a 1:1:1 volumetric mixture of ethylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, and diethyl carbonate. Measurements on the batteries were conducted using the BlueSky testing system, with a current density range of 0.1 to 5 C (where 1 C is equivalent to 274 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121}), and a voltage span of 3.0 to 4.5 V versus Li/LiE^{+}. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out on a CHI660D electrochemical workstation at scanning rates of 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 mV\xb7sE^{\u22121}. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed on IM6, sweeping frequencies from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz with an amplitude of 5 mV.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The preparation procedure for LiTaO3-modified LiCoO2 (LTO-LCO) is illustrated in a, a simple sol\u2013gel method coupled with thermal treatment was utilized to coat LTO onto LCO uniformly. A modification mechanism was proposed based on the synergistic effect of physical isolation and piezoelectricity of the LTO coating layer on LCO. The lattice volume expansion of LCO accompanied the charging and discharging processes, then its stress was imparted onto LTO, leading to its piezoelectric polarization. To ascertain that the coating layer was indeed LTO, pure LTO powder was synthesized using the same preparation methodology employed in the fabrication of LTO-LCO. An XRD pattern with Rietveld refinement data (b) confirms that the synthesized material is pure LTO without other impurities. Characterization via Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), as illustrated in c, revealed that the LTO particles exhibited a uniform size distribution, with diameters averaging approximately 100 nm. The piezoelectric properties of pure LTO were also assessed, as summarized in a. LTO exhibits characteristic features of piezoelectric materials, with a piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) of 8 pC NE^{\u22121}, a dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) of 96.5, a capacitance (C) of 43 pF, and dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) of 0.06. b and 2c present the hysteresis loops of STO and MTO under diverse applied electric fields. For STO, the Pr value was approximately 0.26 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 1 kV/mm, rose to about 0.67 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 2 kV/mm, and reached around 1 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 3 kV/mm. Similarly, for MTO, the Pr value began at roughly 0.006 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 1 kV/mm, climbed to nearly 0.018 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 2 kV/mm, and trended towards 0.031 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 3 kV/mm. The XRD patterns of the synthetic sample powders with different coating contents were tested, as shown in a. No matter whether before and after coated LCO, the main diffraction peaks corresponding to (003), (101), and (104) planes indicate a hexagonal layered \u03b1-NaFeO2 structure with space group R-3 m (PDF#70\u20132685). The stable peak positions indicated that LTO modification did not alter the original crystal structure of LCO. Concurrently, as the LTO content increased, its diffraction peak became sharper, with a more pronounced differentiation of the (006)/(012) double peaks, indicating enhanced crystallinity and a more ordered layered structure. Rietveld refinement of the XRD shown in a and , and the refined data  confirm no apparent crystal change for LTO and LCO. S(2) of lattice mismatch, the lattice mismatch between LCO and LTO is as low as 2.13 %, indicating that the LTO coating layer and LCO material have excellent interface compatibility. SEM images (as depicted in b) reveal that the surface of the pristine LCO particle is smooth. In contrast, post-coating powders particles appeared on the surface of LCO grains, and the surface became coarser with the increased amount of coating layer. However, the particle size of LCO grains has no significant alteration, maintaining at approximately 5 \u03bcm, suggesting quite a thin LTO coating layer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to further investigate the thickness and uniformity of the coating layer across different content. As illustrated in c, the thickness of the coating layer shows a clear linear growth trend, increasing from 3.5 nm to 6.5 nm, and 10.5 nm with LTO coating amounts of 1 wt% to 3 wt%, respectively. In the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample (d), the interface structure between the LCO matrix and the LTO coating was displayed. Lattice fringes corresponding to the (012) plane with an average spacing of 0.23 nm were identified, while heteroepitaxial lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.21 nm were attributed to the (202) plane of LTO. The HRTEM image revealed excellent interfacial bonding between the LTO coating and the LCO matrix, with no noticeable interfacial defects or gaps observed. This tight interfacial bonding facilitated the stabilization of the electrode\u2013electrolyte interface, thereby promoting efficient LiE^{+} migration. Furthermore, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was performed on the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample, as shown in e, to reveal the uniform distribution of Ta, Co elements on the LCO surface. The uniform presence of Ta indicates that the LTO coating layer was uniformly deposited on the surface of the LCO particles. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to investigate the surface elemental composition and valence state distribution of LTO-LCO samples. The spectra were standardized using the C 1 s peak at 284.8 eV, as depicted in and. The full spectra of LCO, 1 wt%, 2 wt%, and 3 wt% LTO-LCO show five main peaks at about 55, 284, 531, 684, and 780 eV, as shown in a and S1a, which correspond to the Li 1 s, C 1 s, O 1 s, F 1 s, and Co 2p spectra, respectively. The peaks at approximately 27.5 and 25.6 eV likely originate from the Ta 4f5/2 and Ta 4f7/2 spin\u2013orbit doublet of the TaE^{5+} oxidation state in the LTO coating (as illustrated in b), which emerges only after the coating process. In c and S2b-c, the XPS spectra display the Co 2p region for LCO samples before and after LTO coating. The binding energies of Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 were located around 795 eV and 780 eV, respectively, indicating that the LTO coating layer did not induce rehybridization of the Co 2p orbitals, thus maintaining a relatively stable chemical environment for cobalt. In addition, d displays the O 1 s spectra of LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples after 100 cycles. As depicted, the three peaks between 528 eV and 535 eV reflect the lattice oxygen peak, the oxygen vacancy peak, and the adsorbed oxygen peak, respectively. The lattice oxygen contents for LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples were determined to be 38.57 % and 49.64 %, respectively. This suggests that the LTO layer inhibits the oxidation of lattice oxygen at high voltages, thereby stabilizing the crystal structure of LCO and suppressing the formation of byproducts on the surface of LCO particles. The content of the adsorbed oxygen peak located around 532 eV shows an apparent decrease after LTO coating. This means that the LTO layer can be used as a protective barrier to prevent the adsorption of oxygen molecules and thus reduce the degree of surface oxidation for the LCO cathode material. From the C 1 s spectrum in e, the content percentage of Li2CO3 peak reduced by 3.87 % from 15.59 % of LCO to 11.72 % of 2 wt% LTO-LCO. The COC peak content percentage decreased by 7.07 % from LCO to 2 wt% LTO-LCO. This may be attributed to effectively isolating the electrolyte from physical contact with LCO by the LTO coating layer, thereby reducing the alkaline content on the surface of LCO particles. As depicted in f, the F 1 s spectrum was divided into three peaks, corresponding to C-F, LiF, and LixPOyFz/LixPFy, respectively. From the pristine LCO to 2 wt% LTO-LCO, the LixPOyFz/LixPFy peak disappeared, and the LiF peak content also decreased. This also means that the LTO coating layer reduces the physical contact between the electrolyte and LCO, thereby decreasing the decomposition of the LiPF6 component. Herein, LTO as a coating layer can effectively inhibit the occurrence of side reactions. To investigate the impact of piezoelectric LTO coating layer for the electrochemical performance of LCO, the charge\u2013discharge process of LCO samples before and after LTO coating were evaluated within a voltage range of 3.0 to 4.5 V. a depicts the cycling performance and coulomb efficiency curves of pristine LCO, 1 wt%, 2 wt%, and 3 wt% LTO-LCO samples at 0.1 C. The pristine LCO sample deteriorated at the 142nd cycle. The charge\u2013discharge cycles lead to repeated expansion and contraction of the crystal structure of LCO samples, which causes the accumulation of mechanical stress in LCO, resulting in capacity fade. As shown in , the surfaces of the original LCO grains were affected by cracks caused by stress resulting from long-term cycling. In contrast, the LCO grains coated with LTO exhibited a significant reduction in stress-induced expansion. In the TEM image of the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample after long-term cycling , the interface structure between the LCO matrix and the LTO coating was displayed. Excellent interfacial bonding between the LTO coating and the LCO matrix was observed, with no noticeable interfacial defects or gaps. The results show that the LTO coating is not damaged by the stress during the long-term cycle and maintains good integrity. After 200 cycles, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample maintained a high discharge specific capacity of 172.8 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} and a good capacity retention rate of 84.8 %. In addition, as illustrated in b, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample testing at different rates also exhibited the highest discharge-specific capacities compared with the reference samples. For example, it maintained a capacity of 135.8 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} at a rate of 5 C and a capacity of 194.5 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} with the rate restored from 5 C to 0.1 C (97.3 % capacity retention rate). c displays the first charge\u2013discharge curves for all testing samples. It can be observed that the use of the LTO coating layer can improve the initial Coulombic efficiency of the LCO electrode. The 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample exhibited a high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 76.73 %, significantly surpassing the pristine LCO (28.46 %). As can be observed from d and 5e, and e and S3f, voltage decay occurred as the number of cycles increased, related to the structural phase transitions and interfacial side reactions of LCO. During the charging process, an ordered-to-disordered transition occurred in the LCO samples when the voltage reached approximately 4.2 V, leading to fluctuations of the voltage drop in the charging curve. At a charging voltage of 4.5 V, a phase transition from the O3 phase to the H1-3 phase occurred, causing a capacity fade in the LCO samples. It can be observed that the pristine LCO sample exhibited fluctuations in the curve at positions of 4.10 and 4.18 V, while these fluctuations gradually disappeared for LTO coating samples. In addition, g-h and a-b present the first three cycles of CV curves for the four samples. It can be observed that the pristine LCO sample exhibited fluctuations in the curve at 4.18 V, whereas the LTO-coated samples did not show this phenomenon. The redox peaks remained unchanged, indicating that the LTO coating layer did not alter the structure of LCO, effectively extending the cycling life of LCO. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of LTO-LCO electrodes were conducted to further analyze the impact of the LTO coating layer on LiE^{+} diffusion kinetics. a-b and S3c-d present the CV curves at the 0th, 3rd, 50th, and 100th cycles for LTO-LCO electrode testing at a scan rate of 0.2 mV\xb7sE^{\u22121}. For pristine LCO electrodes, the intensity of the redox peaks decreased sharply, and the half-widths increased gradually with the increase of cycle numbers. However, for the 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrode, the intensity of the redox peaks strengthened, and the half-widths narrowed with the rise in cycle numbers. Furthermore, the CV curves were obtained with scan rates from 0.3 to 0.6 mV\xb7sE^{\u22121} within the 3.0\u20134.5 V voltage range, as illustrated in c-d, and g-h. For both of pristine LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrodes, their redox peak potentials shifted to both sides with the increased scan rates, indicating the polarization phenomenon of the battery. The linear relationship between the scan rate and the peak current in the CV curves was fitted by the Randles-Sevcik equation. As illustrated in e-f, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrode shows the highest slope among all the samples. Then the lithium-ion diffusion coefficients (DLi+) corresponding to the redox peaks of LTO-LCO electrodes were calculated using eq. S(3) , as depicted in g. The detailed DLi+ values are shown in and the 2 wt%LTO-LCO electrode exhibits the highest DLi+. Although the LTO coating layer does not provide battery electrode capacity, it enhances the LiE^{+} diffusion coefficient. h-i depict the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) for LTO-LCO electrode testing at the first and the 200 cycles. The 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples exhibited the smallest solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) impedances (Rsf) for both the first and the 200 cycles, indicating the lowest impedance for LiE^{+} transport through the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). This suggests that the LTO coating layer reduced the direct contact between the LCO material and the electrolyte, thereby decreasing the occurrence of side reactions. Interestingly, the impedance values of 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples decreased gradually with cycle counts from the first to 200 cycles , which may be attributed to the fact that the piezoelectric properties of the LTO coating layer accelerated the diffusion rate of LiE^{+} at the electrolyte interface and formed a more stable and reliable electrolyte interface. The XPS spectra of the Bare LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples after 100 cycles are shown in. It was demonstrated that the LTO coating significantly suppressed the generation of side reactions at the electrode interface and the decomposition of the electrolyte. This effect facilitated easier LiE^{+} migration, thereby validating the role of LTO in regulating LiE^{+} behavior. In addition, low-temperature STO and MTO were studied as coatings for LCO electrodes. S(2) (see ), the lattice mismatch between MTO and LCO is small, while the lattice mismatch between STO and LCO is large. However, TEM analysis shows that STO and MTO cover the LCO interface, as shown in. The increase in electrochemical performance verifies the general applicability of ferroelectric coatings in converting the stresses generated during the LCO high-voltage charging-discharge cycle into polarized fields, thereby increasing the diffusion rate of LiE^{+}. shows the cycling and rate performance curves of STO-LCO and MTO-LCO electrodes with different contents as coating layers, tested in the voltage range of 3.0\u20134.5 V. The cycling and rate performance of the LCO electrodes were significantly improved after being coated with 1 wt% STO and MTO materials. This confirmed the general applicability of these materials in improving the performance of LCO. However, the performance of the LCO electrodes coated with LTO was even higher, indicating that while both STO and MTO coatings could improve the electrochemical performance of LCO, the LTO coating exhibited superior performance in terms of cycle stability and rate capability. The improved performance of the LTO-coated LCO can be attributed to its stronger spontaneous polarization and better piezoelectric properties, which more effectively converted the stress generated during high-pressure charging and discharging into a polarizing electric field. By studying the theoretical and experimental results in the existing literature , we propose a mechanism to explain how LTO coatings improve the electrochemical properties of the positive electrode of LCO. The modification mechanism of piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings on LCO electrodes is illustrated in. During the charge\u2013discharge cycles, the insertion and extraction of LiE^{+} ions caused lattice expansion and a series of phase transitions in the LCO electrode, leading to stress\u2013strain accumulation. During the charging process, the extraction of lithium ions induced lattice expansion in the LCO electrode, generating stress that was subsequently transferred to the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings. These coatings then produced polarization fields opposite the direction of the stress and the LiE^{+} transport direction, preventing overcharging of the LCO electrode. In the discharging process, the stress on the coatings began to decrease, causing the polarization fields to align with the external electric field, which facilitated the insertion of LiE^{+} into the LCO electrode. At this stage, the polarization field acts as an accelerator for LiE^{+}, thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance of LCO. In summary, since the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings do not contribute to charge\u2013discharge capacity, the enhancement of the LCO electrode's electrochemical performance can be attributed to: 1) the reduction of physical contact between LCO and the electrolyte by the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings, thereby reducing the occurrence of interfacial side reactions; 2) the formation of a polarization field by the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings, which regulates the insertion and extraction of LiE^{+} during cycling, thus suppressing the ordered-to-disordered phase transition and mitigating the structural degradation of LCO.

Measurements on the batteries were conducted using the BlueSky testing system, with a current density range of 0.1 to 5 C (where 1 C is equivalent to 274 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121}), and a voltage span of 3.0 to 4.5 V versus Li/LiE^{+}. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out on a CHI660D electrochemical workstation at scanning rates of 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 mV\xb7sE^{\u22121}. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed on IM6, sweeping frequencies from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz with an amplitude of 5 mV.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The preparation procedure for LiTaO3-modified LiCoO2 (LTO-LCO) is illustrated in a, a simple sol\u2013gel method coupled with thermal treatment was utilized to coat LTO onto LCO uniformly. A modification mechanism was proposed based on the synergistic effect of physical isolation and piezoelectricity of the LTO coating layer on LCO. The lattice volume expansion of LCO accompanied the charging and discharging processes, then its stress was imparted onto LTO, leading to its piezoelectric polarization. To ascertain that the coating layer was indeed LTO, pure LTO powder was synthesized using the same preparation methodology employed in the fabrication of LTO-LCO. An XRD pattern with Rietveld refinement data (b) confirms that the synthesized material is pure LTO without other impurities. Characterization via Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), as illustrated in c, revealed that the LTO particles exhibited a uniform size distribution, with diameters averaging approximately 100 nm. The piezoelectric properties of pure LTO were also assessed, as summarized in a. LTO exhibits characteristic features of piezoelectric materials, with a piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) of 8 pC NE^{\u22121}, a dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) of 96.5, a capacitance (C) of 43 pF, and dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) of 0.06. b and 2c present the hysteresis loops of STO and MTO under diverse applied electric fields. For STO, the Pr value was approximately 0.26 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 1 kV/mm, rose to about 0.67 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 2 kV/mm, and reached around 1 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 3 kV/mm. Similarly, for MTO, the Pr value began at roughly 0.006 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 1 kV/mm, climbed to nearly 0.018 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 2 kV/mm, and trended towards 0.031 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 3 kV/mm. The XRD patterns of the synthetic sample powders with different coating contents were tested, as shown in a. No matter whether before and after coated LCO, the main diffraction peaks corresponding to (003), (101), and (104) planes indicate a hexagonal layered \u03b1-NaFeO2 structure with space group R-3 m (PDF#70\u20132685). The stable peak positions indicated that LTO modification did not alter the original crystal structure of LCO. Concurrently, as the LTO content increased, its diffraction peak became sharper, with a more pronounced differentiation of the (006)/(012) double peaks, indicating enhanced crystallinity and a more ordered layered structure. Rietveld refinement of the XRD shown in a and , and the refined data  confirm no apparent crystal change for LTO and LCO. S(2) of lattice mismatch, the lattice mismatch between LCO and LTO is as low as 2.13 %, indicating that the LTO coating layer and LCO material have excellent interface compatibility. SEM images (as depicted in b) reveal that the surface of the pristine LCO particle is smooth. In contrast, post-coating powders particles appeared on the surface of LCO grains, and the surface became coarser with the increased amount of coating layer. However, the particle size of LCO grains has no significant alteration, maintaining at approximately 5 \u03bcm, suggesting quite a thin LTO coating layer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to further investigate the thickness and uniformity of the coating layer across different content. As illustrated in c, the thickness of the coating layer shows a clear linear growth trend, increasing from 3.5 nm to 6.5 nm, and 10.5 nm with LTO coating amounts of 1 wt% to 3 wt%, respectively. In the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample (d), the interface structure between the LCO matrix and the LTO coating was displayed. Lattice fringes corresponding to the (012) plane with an average spacing of 0.23 nm were identified, while heteroepitaxial lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.21 nm were attributed to the (202) plane of LTO. The HRTEM image revealed excellent interfacial bonding between the LTO coating and the LCO matrix, with no noticeable interfacial defects or gaps observed. This tight interfacial bonding facilitated the stabilization of the electrode\u2013electrolyte interface, thereby promoting efficient LiE^{+} migration. Furthermore, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was performed on the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample, as shown in e, to reveal the uniform distribution of Ta, Co elements on the LCO surface. The uniform presence of Ta indicates that the LTO coating layer was uniformly deposited on the surface of the LCO particles. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to investigate the surface elemental composition and valence state distribution of LTO-LCO samples. The spectra were standardized using the C 1 s peak at 284.8 eV, as depicted in and. The full spectra of LCO, 1 wt%, 2 wt%, and 3 wt% LTO-LCO show five main peaks at about 55, 284, 531, 684, and 780 eV, as shown in a and S1a, which correspond to the Li 1 s, C 1 s, O 1 s, F 1 s, and Co 2p spectra, respectively. The peaks at approximately 27.5 and 25.6 eV likely originate from the Ta 4f5/2 and Ta 4f7/2 spin\u2013orbit doublet of the TaE^{5+} oxidation state in the LTO coating (as illustrated in b), which emerges only after the coating process. In c and S2b-c, the XPS spectra display the Co 2p region for LCO samples before and after LTO coating. The binding energies of Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 were located around 795 eV and 780 eV, respectively, indicating that the LTO coating layer did not induce rehybridization of the Co 2p orbitals, thus maintaining a relatively stable chemical environment for cobalt. In addition, d displays the O 1 s spectra of LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples after 100 cycles. As depicted, the three peaks between 528 eV and 535 eV reflect the lattice oxygen peak, the oxygen vacancy peak, and the adsorbed oxygen peak, respectively. The lattice oxygen contents for LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples were determined to be 38.57 % and 49.64 %, respectively. This suggests that the LTO layer inhibits the oxidation of lattice oxygen at high voltages, thereby stabilizing the crystal structure of LCO and suppressing the formation of byproducts on the surface of LCO particles. The content of the adsorbed oxygen peak located around 532 eV shows an apparent decrease after LTO coating. This means that the LTO layer can be used as a protective barrier to prevent the adsorption of oxygen molecules and thus reduce the degree of surface oxidation for the LCO cathode material. From the C 1 s spectrum in e, the content percentage of Li2CO3 peak reduced by 3.87 % from 15.59 % of LCO to 11.72 % of 2 wt% LTO-LCO. The COC peak content percentage decreased by 7.07 % from LCO to 2 wt% LTO-LCO. This may be attributed to effectively isolating the electrolyte from physical contact with LCO by the LTO coating layer, thereby reducing the alkaline content on the surface of LCO particles. As depicted in f, the F 1 s spectrum was divided into three peaks, corresponding to C-F, LiF, and LixPOyFz/LixPFy, respectively. From the pristine LCO to 2 wt% LTO-LCO, the LixPOyFz/LixPFy peak disappeared, and the LiF peak content also decreased. This also means that the LTO coating layer reduces the physical contact between the electrolyte and LCO, thereby decreasing the decomposition of the LiPF6 component. Herein, LTO as a coating layer can effectively inhibit the occurrence of side reactions. To investigate the impact of piezoelectric LTO coating layer for the electrochemical performance of LCO, the charge\u2013discharge process of LCO samples before and after LTO coating were evaluated within a voltage range of 3.0 to 4.5 V. a depicts the cycling performance and coulomb efficiency curves of pristine LCO, 1 wt%, 2 wt%, and 3 wt% LTO-LCO samples at 0.1 C. The pristine LCO sample deteriorated at the 142nd cycle. The charge\u2013discharge cycles lead to repeated expansion and contraction of the crystal structure of LCO samples, which causes the accumulation of mechanical stress in LCO, resulting in capacity fade. As shown in , the surfaces of the original LCO grains were affected by cracks caused by stress resulting from long-term cycling. In contrast, the LCO grains coated with LTO exhibited a significant reduction in stress-induced expansion. In the TEM image of the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample after long-term cycling , the interface structure between the LCO matrix and the LTO coating was displayed. Excellent interfacial bonding between the LTO coating and the LCO matrix was observed, with no noticeable interfacial defects or gaps. The results show that the LTO coating is not damaged by the stress during the long-term cycle and maintains good integrity. After 200 cycles, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample maintained a high discharge specific capacity of 172.8 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} and a good capacity retention rate of 84.8 %. In addition, as illustrated in b, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample testing at different rates also exhibited the highest discharge-specific capacities compared with the reference samples. For example, it maintained a capacity of 135.8 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} at a rate of 5 C and a capacity of 194.5 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} with the rate restored from 5 C to 0.1 C (97.3 % capacity retention rate). c displays the first charge\u2013discharge curves for all testing samples. It can be observed that the use of the LTO coating layer can improve the initial Coulombic efficiency of the LCO electrode. The 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample exhibited a high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 76.73 %, significantly surpassing the pristine LCO (28.46 %). As can be observed from d and 5e, and e and S3f, voltage decay occurred as the number of cycles increased, related to the structural phase transitions and interfacial side reactions of LCO. During the charging process, an ordered-to-disordered transition occurred in the LCO samples when the voltage reached approximately 4.2 V, leading to fluctuations of the voltage drop in the charging curve. At a charging voltage of 4.5 V, a phase transition from the O3 phase to the H1-3 phase occurred, causing a capacity fade in the LCO samples. It can be observed that the pristine LCO sample exhibited fluctuations in the curve at positions of 4.10 and 4.18 V, while these fluctuations gradually disappeared for LTO coating samples. In addition, g-h and a-b present the first three cycles of CV curves for the four samples. It can be observed that the pristine LCO sample exhibited fluctuations in the curve at 4.18 V, whereas the LTO-coated samples did not show this phenomenon. The redox peaks remained unchanged, indicating that the LTO coating layer did not alter the structure of LCO, effectively extending the cycling life of LCO. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of LTO-LCO electrodes were conducted to further analyze the impact of the LTO coating layer on LiE^{+} diffusion kinetics. a-b and S3c-d present the CV curves at the 0th, 3rd, 50th, and 100th cycles for LTO-LCO electrode testing at a scan rate of 0.2 mV\xb7sE^{\u22121}. For pristine LCO electrodes, the intensity of the redox peaks decreased sharply, and the half-widths increased gradually with the increase of cycle numbers. However, for the 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrode, the intensity of the redox peaks strengthened, and the half-widths narrowed with the rise in cycle numbers. Furthermore, the CV curves were obtained with scan rates from 0.3 to 0.6 mV\xb7sE^{\u22121} within the 3.0\u20134.5 V voltage range, as illustrated in c-d, and g-h. For both of pristine LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrodes, their redox peak potentials shifted to both sides with the increased scan rates, indicating the polarization phenomenon of the battery. The linear relationship between the scan rate and the peak current in the CV curves was fitted by the Randles-Sevcik equation. As illustrated in e-f, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrode shows the highest slope among all the samples. Then the lithium-ion diffusion coefficients (DLi+) corresponding to the redox peaks of LTO-LCO electrodes were calculated using eq. S(3) , as depicted in g. The detailed DLi+ values are shown in and the 2 wt%LTO-LCO electrode exhibits the highest DLi+. Although the LTO coating layer does not provide battery electrode capacity, it enhances the LiE^{+} diffusion coefficient. h-i depict the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) for LTO-LCO electrode testing at the first and the 200 cycles. The 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples exhibited the smallest solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) impedances (Rsf) for both the first and the 200 cycles, indicating the lowest impedance for LiE^{+} transport through the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). This suggests that the LTO coating layer reduced the direct contact between the LCO material and the electrolyte, thereby decreasing the occurrence of side reactions. Interestingly, the impedance values of 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples decreased gradually with cycle counts from the first to 200 cycles , which may be attributed to the fact that the piezoelectric properties of the LTO coating layer accelerated the diffusion rate of LiE^{+} at the electrolyte interface and formed a more stable and reliable electrolyte interface. The XPS spectra of the Bare LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples after 100 cycles are shown in. It was demonstrated that the LTO coating significantly suppressed the generation of side reactions at the electrode interface and the decomposition of the electrolyte. This effect facilitated easier LiE^{+} migration, thereby validating the role of LTO in regulating LiE^{+} behavior. In addition, low-temperature STO and MTO were studied as coatings for LCO electrodes. S(2) (see ), the lattice mismatch between MTO and LCO is small, while the lattice mismatch between STO and LCO is large. However, TEM analysis shows that STO and MTO cover the LCO interface, as shown in. The increase in electrochemical performance verifies the general applicability of ferroelectric coatings in converting the stresses generated during the LCO high-voltage charging-discharge cycle into polarized fields, thereby increasing the diffusion rate of LiE^{+}. shows the cycling and rate performance curves of STO-LCO and MTO-LCO electrodes with different contents as coating layers, tested in the voltage range of 3.0\u20134.5 V. The cycling and rate performance of the LCO electrodes were significantly improved after being coated with 1 wt% STO and MTO materials. This confirmed the general applicability of these materials in improving the performance of LCO. However, the performance of the LCO electrodes coated with LTO was even higher, indicating that while both STO and MTO coatings could improve the electrochemical performance of LCO, the LTO coating exhibited superior performance in terms of cycle stability and rate capability. The improved performance of the LTO-coated LCO can be attributed to its stronger spontaneous polarization and better piezoelectric properties, which more effectively converted the stress generated during high-pressure charging and discharging into a polarizing electric field. By studying the theoretical and experimental results in the existing literature , we propose a mechanism to explain how LTO coatings improve the electrochemical properties of the positive electrode of LCO. The modification mechanism of piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings on LCO electrodes is illustrated in. During the charge\u2013discharge cycles, the insertion and extraction of LiE^{+} ions caused lattice expansion and a series of phase transitions in the LCO electrode, leading to stress\u2013strain accumulation. During the charging process, the extraction of lithium ions induced lattice expansion in the LCO electrode, generating stress that was subsequently transferred to the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings. These coatings then produced polarization fields opposite the direction of the stress and the LiE^{+} transport direction, preventing overcharging of the LCO electrode. In the discharging process, the stress on the coatings began to decrease, causing the polarization fields to align with the external electric field, which facilitated the insertion of LiE^{+} into the LCO electrode. At this stage, the polarization field acts as an accelerator for LiE^{+}, thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance of LCO. In summary, since the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings do not contribute to charge\u2013discharge capacity, the enhancement of the LCO electrode's electrochemical performance can be attributed to: 1) the reduction of physical contact between LCO and the electrolyte by the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings, thereby reducing the occurrence of interfacial side reactions; 2) the formation of a polarization field by the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings, which regulates the insertion and extraction of LiE^{+} during cycling, thus suppressing the ordered-to-disordered phase transition and mitigating the structural degradation of LCO.

Preparation of LiTaO3-Modified LiCoO2 (LTO-LCO) Samples: To prepare LTO-modified LCO samples with different LTO contents (0 wt%, 1 wt%, 2 wt%, and 3 wt%), we followed a specific procedure. Using the optimal coating ratio of LTO to pristine LCO in a 2:100 (2 wt% LTO-LCO) sample as an example, the steps are as follows: First, a certain molar mass of Ta2O5, CH3COOLi\xb72H2O, and C4H6O6 (C4H6O6 vs. cations = 2:3) were separately dissolved in ethanol. Then, the solution was mixed with commercial LCO powders (Guangdong Canrd New Energy Technology Co., Ltd) and vigorously stirred. The mixed solution was evaporated and stirred at 80 \xb0C until a sol was formed. The sol was aged at 120 \xb0C for 10 h to obtain a gel. The powder was annealed at 500 \xb0C for 12 h and then cooled to room temperature. To avoid the influence of the sintering temperature for LCO, the uncoated pristine LCO also underwent the same drying and annealing steps to minimize experimental errors. Preparation of pure LTO samples: The preparation of pure LTO samples was similar to the above experimental procedure, without adding LCO during the experiment. The LTO powders were then compacted into disk by uniaxial pressing in a stainless-steel die using polyvinyl butyral binder. The disk was sintered in air at 500 \xb0C for 3 h. In addition, the preparation of SrTiO3 (STO), MgTiO3 (MTO), STO-LCO, and MTO-LCO samples were described in. The crystal structure of LTO-coated LCO samples was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku SmartLab 9 kW). The morphology and composition of LTO and LCO samples before and after coating were analyzed using field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Gemini300) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, X-MaxE^{N} 50). The thickness of the samples before and after LTO coating was examined using field emission transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-F200). The elemental composition was investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB250). The disk samples were poled in silicon oil for 30 min. The piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) of the poled ceramics was measured using a quasistatic d 33 meter (ZJ-3A, Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China). The dielectric constant (\u03b5 r), capacitance (C), and dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) at 1 kHz of the LTO ceramics were measured using a precision LCR meter (E4990A, Keysight, Santa Clara, USA). The prepared sample powder was mixed with PVDF (as a binder) and conductive carbon black (as a conductive agent) in an 8:1:1 wt ratio. This blend was thoroughly ground, followed by dispersion in NMP to form a homogeneous slurry. The slurry was then evenly coated onto aluminum foil and dried at 100 \xb0C for 10 h. The dried foils were cut into circular discs of 8 mm diameter. Button cells (CR2032) were assembled in an argon-filled glove box, utilizing lithium foil as the counter electrode and a 2400 porous polypropylene film as the separator. The electrolyte consisted of 1 M LiPF6 solution in a 1:1:1 volumetric mixture of ethylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, and diethyl carbonate. Measurements on the batteries were conducted using the BlueSky testing system, with a current density range of 0.1 to 5 C (where 1 C is equivalent to 274 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121}), and a voltage span of 3.0 to 4.5 V versus Li/LiE^{+}. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out on a CHI660D electrochemical workstation at scanning rates of 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 mV\xb7sE^{\u22121}. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed on IM6, sweeping frequencies from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz with an amplitude of 5 mV.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The preparation procedure for LiTaO3-modified LiCoO2 (LTO-LCO) is illustrated in a, a simple sol\u2013gel method coupled with thermal treatment was utilized to coat LTO onto LCO uniformly. A modification mechanism was proposed based on the synergistic effect of physical isolation and piezoelectricity of the LTO coating layer on LCO.

An XRD pattern with Rietveld refinement data (b) confirms that the synthesized material is pure LTO without other impurities. Characterization via Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), as illustrated in c, revealed that the LTO particles exhibited a uniform size distribution, with diameters averaging approximately 100 nm. The piezoelectric properties of pure LTO were also assessed, as summarized in a. LTO exhibits characteristic features of piezoelectric materials, with a piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) of 8 pC NE^{\u22121}, a dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) of 96.5, a capacitance (C) of 43 pF, and dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) of 0.06. b and 2c present the hysteresis loops of STO and MTO under diverse applied electric fields. For STO, the Pr value was approximately 0.26 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 1 kV/mm, rose to about 0.67 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 2 kV/mm, and reached around 1 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 3 kV/mm. Similarly, for MTO, the Pr value began at roughly 0.006 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 1 kV/mm, climbed to nearly 0.018 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 2 kV/mm, and trended towards 0.031 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 3 kV/mm. The XRD patterns of the synthetic sample powders with different coating contents were tested, as shown in a. No matter whether before and after coated LCO, the main diffraction peaks corresponding to (003), (101), and (104) planes indicate a hexagonal layered \u03b1-NaFeO2 structure with space group R-3 m (PDF#70\u20132685). The stable peak positions indicated that LTO modification did not alter the original crystal structure of LCO. Concurrently, as the LTO content increased, its diffraction peak became sharper, with a more pronounced differentiation of the (006)/(012) double peaks, indicating enhanced crystallinity and a more ordered layered structure. Rietveld refinement of the XRD shown in a and , and the refined data  confirm no apparent crystal change for LTO and LCO. S(2) of lattice mismatch, the lattice mismatch between LCO and LTO is as low as 2.13 %, indicating that the LTO coating layer and LCO material have excellent interface compatibility. SEM images (as depicted in b) reveal that the surface of the pristine LCO particle is smooth. In contrast, post-coating powders particles appeared on the surface of LCO grains, and the surface became coarser with the increased amount of coating layer. However, the particle size of LCO grains has no significant alteration, maintaining at approximately 5 \u03bcm, suggesting quite a thin LTO coating layer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to further investigate the thickness and uniformity of the coating layer across different content. As illustrated in c, the thickness of the coating layer shows a clear linear growth trend, increasing from 3.5 nm to 6.5 nm, and 10.5 nm with LTO coating amounts of 1 wt% to 3 wt%, respectively. In the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample (d), the interface structure between the LCO matrix and the LTO coating was displayed. Lattice fringes corresponding to the (012) plane with an average spacing of 0.23 nm were identified, while heteroepitaxial lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.21 nm were attributed to the (202) plane of LTO. The HRTEM image revealed excellent interfacial bonding between the LTO coating and the LCO matrix, with no noticeable interfacial defects or gaps observed. This tight interfacial bonding facilitated the stabilization of the electrode\u2013electrolyte interface, thereby promoting efficient LiE^{+} migration. Furthermore, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was performed on the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample, as shown in e, to reveal the uniform distribution of Ta, Co elements on the LCO surface. The uniform presence of Ta indicates that the LTO coating layer was uniformly deposited on the surface of the LCO particles. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to investigate the surface elemental composition and valence state distribution of LTO-LCO samples. The spectra were standardized using the C 1 s peak at 284.8 eV, as depicted in and. The full spectra of LCO, 1 wt%, 2 wt%, and 3 wt% LTO-LCO show five main peaks at about 55, 284, 531, 684, and 780 eV, as shown in a and S1a, which correspond to the Li 1 s, C 1 s, O 1 s, F 1 s, and Co 2p spectra, respectively. The peaks at approximately 27.5 and 25.6 eV likely originate from the Ta 4f5/2 and Ta 4f7/2 spin\u2013orbit doublet of the TaE^{5+} oxidation state in the LTO coating (as illustrated in b), which emerges only after the coating process. In c and S2b-c, the XPS spectra display the Co 2p region for LCO samples before and after LTO coating. The binding energies of Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 were located around 795 eV and 780 eV, respectively, indicating that the LTO coating layer did not induce rehybridization of the Co 2p orbitals, thus maintaining a relatively stable chemical environment for cobalt. In addition, d displays the O 1 s spectra of LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples after 100 cycles. As depicted, the three peaks between 528 eV and 535 eV reflect the lattice oxygen peak, the oxygen vacancy peak, and the adsorbed oxygen peak, respectively. The lattice oxygen contents for LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples were determined to be 38.57 % and 49.64 %, respectively. This suggests that the LTO layer inhibits the oxidation of lattice oxygen at high voltages, thereby stabilizing the crystal structure of LCO and suppressing the formation of byproducts on the surface of LCO particles. The content of the adsorbed oxygen peak located around 532 eV shows an apparent decrease after LTO coating. This means that the LTO layer can be used as a protective barrier to prevent the adsorption of oxygen molecules and thus reduce the degree of surface oxidation for the LCO cathode material. From the C 1 s spectrum in e, the content percentage of Li2CO3 peak reduced by 3.87 % from 15.59 % of LCO to 11.72 % of 2 wt% LTO-LCO. The COC peak content percentage decreased by 7.07 % from LCO to 2 wt% LTO-LCO. This may be attributed to effectively isolating the electrolyte from physical contact with LCO by the LTO coating layer, thereby reducing the alkaline content on the surface of LCO particles. As depicted in f, the F 1 s spectrum was divided into three peaks, corresponding to C-F, LiF, and LixPOyFz/LixPFy, respectively. From the pristine LCO to 2 wt% LTO-LCO, the LixPOyFz/LixPFy peak disappeared, and the LiF peak content also decreased. This also means that the LTO coating layer reduces the physical contact between the electrolyte and LCO, thereby decreasing the decomposition of the LiPF6 component. Herein, LTO as a coating layer can effectively inhibit the occurrence of side reactions. To investigate the impact of piezoelectric LTO coating layer for the electrochemical performance of LCO, the charge\u2013discharge process of LCO samples before and after LTO coating were evaluated within a voltage range of 3.0 to 4.5 V. a depicts the cycling performance and coulomb efficiency curves of pristine LCO, 1 wt%, 2 wt%, and 3 wt% LTO-LCO samples at 0.1 C. The pristine LCO sample deteriorated at the 142nd cycle. The charge\u2013discharge cycles lead to repeated expansion and contraction of the crystal structure of LCO samples, which causes the accumulation of mechanical stress in LCO, resulting in capacity fade. As shown in , the surfaces of the original LCO grains were affected by cracks caused by stress resulting from long-term cycling. In contrast, the LCO grains coated with LTO exhibited a significant reduction in stress-induced expansion. In the TEM image of the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample after long-term cycling , the interface structure between the LCO matrix and the LTO coating was displayed. Excellent interfacial bonding between the LTO coating and the LCO matrix was observed, with no noticeable interfacial defects or gaps. The results show that the LTO coating is not damaged by the stress during the long-term cycle and maintains good integrity. After 200 cycles, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample maintained a high discharge specific capacity of 172.8 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} and a good capacity retention rate of 84.8 %. In addition, as illustrated in b, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample testing at different rates also exhibited the highest discharge-specific capacities compared with the reference samples. For example, it maintained a capacity of 135.8 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} at a rate of 5 C and a capacity of 194.5 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} with the rate restored from 5 C to 0.1 C (97.3 % capacity retention rate). c displays the first charge\u2013discharge curves for all testing samples. It can be observed that the use of the LTO coating layer can improve the initial Coulombic efficiency of the LCO electrode. The 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample exhibited a high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 76.73 %, significantly surpassing the pristine LCO (28.46 %). As can be observed from d and 5e, and e and S3f, voltage decay occurred as the number of cycles increased, related to the structural phase transitions and interfacial side reactions of LCO. During the charging process, an ordered-to-disordered transition occurred in the LCO samples when the voltage reached approximately 4.2 V, leading to fluctuations of the voltage drop in the charging curve. At a charging voltage of 4.5 V, a phase transition from the O3 phase to the H1-3 phase occurred, causing a capacity fade in the LCO samples. It can be observed that the pristine LCO sample exhibited fluctuations in the curve at positions of 4.10 and 4.18 V, while these fluctuations gradually disappeared for LTO coating samples. In addition, g-h and a-b present the first three cycles of CV curves for the four samples. It can be observed that the pristine LCO sample exhibited fluctuations in the curve at 4.18 V, whereas the LTO-coated samples did not show this phenomenon. The redox peaks remained unchanged, indicating that the LTO coating layer did not alter the structure of LCO, effectively extending the cycling life of LCO. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of LTO-LCO electrodes were conducted to further analyze the impact of the LTO coating layer on LiE^{+} diffusion kinetics. a-b and S3c-d present the CV curves at the 0th, 3rd, 50th, and 100th cycles for LTO-LCO electrode testing at a scan rate of 0.2 mV\xb7sE^{\u22121}. For pristine LCO electrodes, the intensity of the redox peaks decreased sharply, and the half-widths increased gradually with the increase of cycle numbers. However, for the 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrode, the intensity of the redox peaks strengthened, and the half-widths narrowed with the rise in cycle numbers. Furthermore, the CV curves were obtained with scan rates from 0.3 to 0.6 mV\xb7sE^{\u22121} within the 3.0\u20134.5 V voltage range, as illustrated in c-d, and g-h. For both of pristine LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrodes, their redox peak potentials shifted to both sides with the increased scan rates, indicating the polarization phenomenon of the battery. The linear relationship between the scan rate and the peak current in the CV curves was fitted by the Randles-Sevcik equation. As illustrated in e-f, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrode shows the highest slope among all the samples. Then the lithium-ion diffusion coefficients (DLi+) corresponding to the redox peaks of LTO-LCO electrodes were calculated using eq. S(3) , as depicted in g. The detailed DLi+ values are shown in and the 2 wt%LTO-LCO electrode exhibits the highest DLi+. Although the LTO coating layer does not provide battery electrode capacity, it enhances the LiE^{+} diffusion coefficient. h-i depict the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) for LTO-LCO electrode testing at the first and the 200 cycles. The 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples exhibited the smallest solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) impedances (Rsf) for both the first and the 200 cycles, indicating the lowest impedance for LiE^{+} transport through the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). This suggests that the LTO coating layer reduced the direct contact between the LCO material and the electrolyte, thereby decreasing the occurrence of side reactions. Interestingly, the impedance values of 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples decreased gradually with cycle counts from the first to 200 cycles , which may be attributed to the fact that the piezoelectric properties of the LTO coating layer accelerated the diffusion rate of LiE^{+} at the electrolyte interface and formed a more stable and reliable electrolyte interface. The XPS spectra of the Bare LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples after 100 cycles are shown in. It was demonstrated that the LTO coating significantly suppressed the generation of side reactions at the electrode interface and the decomposition of the electrolyte. This effect facilitated easier LiE^{+} migration, thereby validating the role of LTO in regulating LiE^{+} behavior. In addition, low-temperature STO and MTO were studied as coatings for LCO electrodes. S(2) (see ), the lattice mismatch between MTO and LCO is small, while the lattice mismatch between STO and LCO is large. However, TEM analysis shows that STO and MTO cover the LCO interface, as shown in. The increase in electrochemical performance verifies the general applicability of ferroelectric coatings in converting the stresses generated during the LCO high-voltage charging-discharge cycle into polarized fields, thereby increasing the diffusion rate of LiE^{+}. shows the cycling and rate performance curves of STO-LCO and MTO-LCO electrodes with different contents as coating layers, tested in the voltage range of 3.0\u20134.5 V. The cycling and rate performance of the LCO electrodes were significantly improved after being coated with 1 wt% STO and MTO materials. This confirmed the general applicability of these materials in improving the performance of LCO. However, the performance of the LCO electrodes coated with LTO was even higher, indicating that while both STO and MTO coatings could improve the electrochemical performance of LCO, the LTO coating exhibited superior performance in terms of cycle stability and rate capability. The improved performance of the LTO-coated LCO can be attributed to its stronger spontaneous polarization and better piezoelectric properties, which more effectively converted the stress generated during high-pressure charging and discharging into a polarizing electric field. By studying the theoretical and experimental results in the existing literature , we propose a mechanism to explain how LTO coatings improve the electrochemical properties of the positive electrode of LCO. The modification mechanism of piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings on LCO electrodes is illustrated in. During the charge\u2013discharge cycles, the insertion and extraction of LiE^{+} ions caused lattice expansion and a series of phase transitions in the LCO electrode, leading to stress\u2013strain accumulation. During the charging process, the extraction of lithium ions induced lattice expansion in the LCO electrode, generating stress that was subsequently transferred to the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings. These coatings then produced polarization fields opposite the direction of the stress and the LiE^{+} transport direction, preventing overcharging of the LCO electrode. In the discharging process, the stress on the coatings began to decrease, causing the polarization fields to align with the external electric field, which facilitated the insertion of LiE^{+} into the LCO electrode. At this stage, the polarization field acts as an accelerator for LiE^{+}, thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance of LCO. In summary, since the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings do not contribute to charge\u2013discharge capacity, the enhancement of the LCO electrode's electrochemical performance can be attributed to: 1) the reduction of physical contact between LCO and the electrolyte by the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings, thereby reducing the occurrence of interfacial side reactions; 2) the formation of a polarization field by the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings, which regulates the insertion and extraction of LiE^{+} during cycling, thus suppressing the ordered-to-disordered phase transition and mitigating the structural degradation of LCO.
