Synthesis of (1-x)Bi1.02FeO3-xBaTiO3 (BF-xBT, x = 0.29, 0.3, 0.31, 0.32) ceramics were accomplished by conventional high temperature solid-state reaction method. Raw materials of Bi2O3 (99.9 %), Fe2O3 (99.9 %), BaCO3 (99.8 %) and TiO2 (99.8 %) were weighed according to the stoichiometric formula. Excess 2 mol% Bi2O3 powders were added for the compensation due to their volatile nature. Powders were planetary milled using ethanol as a dispersant with zirconia balls for 12 h. The mixed oxides were dried and then calcined at 800 \xb0C for 6 h. After calcination, the powders were re-milled with ethanol and zirconia ball for 12 h, then dried, mixed with 7 wt% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and pressed into 10 mm diameter pellets. After burning out PVA at 300 \xb0C for 1 h, sintering was carried out at 970 \xb0C for 3 h. To characterize electrical properties, the 0.5 mm thick polished samples were pasted with high-temperature silver electrodes and fired at 850 \xb0C for 30 min. The DC poling with 4 kV/mm electric field was carried out at 80 \xb0C in a silicone oil bath for 20 min. All the samples have been aged for 24 h before electrical characterizations. The phase structure and microstructure were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (MAXima_XRD-7000, Shimadzu, Japan) and scanning electron microscopy (EM-30 Plus, COXEM, South Korea). The P-E loops of the bulk ceramics were measured by a ferroelectric test system (PolyK Technologies, USA). The temperature dependence of dielectric constant and impedance spectroscopy data were obtained by a DMS2000 test system (Partulab Technology Co., Ltd., China). The piezoelectric properties were measured using a quasi-static piezoelectric coefficient testing meter (YNS-ZJ-6BN, Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing, China). The planar electromechanical coupling factor k p and mechanical quality factor Q m were determined by resonance-antiresonance method using a precision impedance analyzer (WK6515B, Wayne Kerr Electronics, UK). The in-situ d 33 was detected by using a high temperature in-situ d 33 test instrument (PDTS-600, Yanhe technology, China).

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a) shows the XRD patterns for of BF-xBT ceramics. The vertical bars represent the standard diffraction peaks of rhombohedral phase (R) (R3c ICSD code 417,311) and cubic phase (C) (Pm 3\u203e m ICSD code 28,848), respectively. In the locally magnified XRD patterns as shown in (b), the (111) around 39\xb0 and (200) around 45\xb0 peaks are typically used to identify R phase structure. A splitting (111) peak with a single (200) peak suggests a predominance of R phase. Peaks splits of (111) around 39\xb0 were observed for x = 0.29\u20130.31 and spilt of (111) peak becomes nearly indistinguishable for x = 0.32. the symmetry of (111) peak increased and the crystal structure approached C phase with increasing BT content. However, the obvious ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties for these compositions indicated that a fully symmetrical cubic phase was unreasonable, hence a mixture of R and pseudo-cubic (PC) phases should be responsible for these compositions. To reveal the actual crystal structures, Rietveld refinement analyses were performed for all compositions by using GSAS \u2161 as shown in , lattice parameters, phase ratios, and goodness-of-fit values \u03c7E^{2} are listed in. From the refinement results, it is evident that MPB containing R and PC phases exists in all researched compositions, the lattice parameter \u03b1 of R phase and phase fractions of C phase increases gradually with increasing x, which indicates the rhombohedral distortion decreased and the crystal structure transformed into cubic like phase. Regarding piezoelectric ceramics, high d 33 can be obtained owing to the typical MPB and the changes in crystal structure observed in this study was consistent with those of previously reported. To detect the grain morphology evolution upon increasing x, the cross sections SEM images of BF-xBT ceramics were shown in , the corresponding insets show the grain size distributions which were measured by using Nano measurer. It is obvious that with the increase of BT content, the average grain sizes of the ceramics increase slightly at first and then display a tendency of decrease, which corresponds with the fact that higher sintering temperature of BT (\u223c1600 \xb0C) content inhibits the grain growth. Temperature-dependent dielectric properties of BF-xBT ceramics at different frequencies are shown in , all compositions exhibit sharp ferroelectric to paraelectric phase transition peaks and the temperature corresponding to the dielectric phase transition peak is defined as the Curie temperature. However, inconspicuous relaxor behavior occurs in ceramics with x = 0.32, peaks decrease, widen and shift to slightly higher temperature with increasing frequencies, which is a typical characteristic for relaxor ferroelectrics. Curie temperatures of the samples decrease monotonously with the increase of x, which were 525 \xb0C, 501 \xb0C, 485 \xb0C and 467 \xb0C, respectively. Dielectric loss curves also descend monotonously with the increase of x, as BT possesses much lower Curie temperature and dielectric loss than BF. At frequency 1 kHz around 400 \xb0C, a dielectric anomaly was detected in all compositions but nearly vanished at x = 0.32. This short-range displacement may cause dielectric anomalies and a huge dielectric loss. (a) shows P-E loops of BF-xBT ceramics, all compositions exhibit well-saturated hysteresis loops, no visible trace of leakage conductance. It is believed that the occurrence of an inhibited domain switching behavior which is commonly associated with domain wall pinning in BiFeO3 ceramics, is caused by defect dipoles. To identify the mechanism responsible for such hysteresis loops, various continuous cyclic electric fields were applied on x = 0.3 sample and the results were shown in (b). Significant changes can be seen in the P-E loops under cyclic electric field of 5 kV/mm, both P max and P r increased notably after repeating cycles of bipolar electric fields, and then approach to an extent of saturation after 1000 cycles. In high temperature sintering environment, oxygen escape from the ceramics easily thus oxygen vacancies form, according to defect reaction OO\xd7\u2192 VO \u2219\u2219+ O (g)+ e\u2032E^{1}E^{2}E^{2}E^{2}. The electrons can be captured by FeE^{3+} and become weakly bound electrons to balance excess charges according to equation Fe Fe\xd7+ e\u2032\u2192 Fe Fe + +\u2032E^{3}E^{2}, causing a high leakage current density. In BiFeO3 the volatile nature of Bi2O3 would create bismuth vacancy and oxygen vacancy which can be explained as 2 Bi Bi\xd7+3 OO\xd7\u21922 V Bi\u2034+3 VO \u2219\u2219+ Bi2 O3\u2191. Therefore, the electrostatic force of these defect charges forms defect complexes (such as { V Bi\u2034\u2212 VO \u22c5\u22c5}\u2032 and { Fe Fe + +\u2032\u2212 VO \u22c5\u22c5}\u2219E^{3}E^{2}), which would hinder the domain wall motion due to defect dipoles on the domain pinning effect under applied electric fields. Cyclic electric fields would induce the relaxation of domain from pinning sites and increase their polarization response , which explains the pronounced enhancement of P r as shown in (b). shows high-temperature impedance spectra of the BF-xBT ceramics, where Z\u2032 and Z\u2033 are regarded as the real and imaginary parts of the complex impedance Z\u2217. All compositions present a partial single semicircle within the measuring frequencies and temperatures, which indicates that the grain resistance is dominant in conduction mechanism in the BF-xBT ceramics. The total resistivity can be estimated by using the low frequency intercept of the arc on Z\u2032 axis. It can be estimated clearly that the total resistivity of BF-xBT ceramics at 450 \xb0C exhibits a tendency of increase with increasing x, which means the introducing of BT content could enhance the insulation of the ceramics. The activation energy (E a), which is the energy barrier that the oxygen vacancies must overcome to participate in conduction, can be obtained by using the Arrhenius plot as shown in (b) from the slope of ln\u03c3\u2212 1000T plots according to \u03c3= \u03c3 e Ea kBTE^{0}, where \u03c3 is the bulk conductivity, \u03c3 0 is the pre-exponent constant, E a is the activation energy of conduction and k is the Boltzmann constant. As shown in (c), all compositions keep an E a value of \u22481.1 eV. The higher activation energy, the lower concentration of free oxygen vacancies at the grains and is in favor of the ceramics to be fully polarized. (a) shows the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 and planar electromechanical coupling factor k p measured at room-temperature as a function of x, the x = 0.31 samples achieved a maximum average d 33 of 191 pC/N, while the k p decreases gradually. (b) shows in-situ depolarization curves of BF-xBT ceramics measured from room temperature to 600 \xb0C, as can be seen, d 33 values increase rapidly to its maximum at first and then decrease with increasing temperature, after drop down to a certain level, the curves maintain almost flat, finally depolarization occurs inevitably and d 33 values decrease to zero as the rise in temperature. The first stage started from room temperature and ended at around 100 \xb0C\u2013150 \xb0C, piezoelectric coefficient presents the tendency of the increase. According to ferroelectric thermodynamics, piezoelectric coefficient of perovskite piezoceramics can be estimated by d33=2Q\u03b5 Pr, where Q is electrostrictive coefficient, \u03b5 is permittivity and P r is remanent polarization. According to the temperature-dependent dielectric properties in , all the samples can be confirmed to be ferroelectric in the first stage, \u03b5 and P r increase with rising temperature in this stage, thus the d 33 increase with rising temperature. Therefore, d 33 curves show a negative temperature coefficient at 150 \xb0C\u2013300 \xb0C. In the third stage, temperature reaches to 300 \xb0C later, a fast increasing of dielectric constant and relaxor behavior appear accompanying with some nanodomains decomposing into polar nano regions. Hence, depolarization curves exhibit a platform according to d33=2Q\u03b5 Pr. In the last stage, ferroelectric to paraelectric phase transition occurs around Curie temperatures, and the piezoelectric responses decrease dramatically and disappear near 600 \xb0C. The temperature when the piezoelectric response decreases sharply is depolarization temperature, it is evident that x = 0.31 sample exhibits a maximum T d of approximately 486 \xb0C as illustrated in (c). Moreover, the depolarization behavior extends beyond Curie temperatures, which results in preserved d 33 values and piezoelectric functions above Curie temperatures. The favorable stability of high-temperature piezoelectric properties makes BF-0.31BT ceramics a promising candidate for high-temperature piezoelectric applications.
