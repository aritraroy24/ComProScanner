Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'solvent casting and hot pressing', 'precursors': ['PVDF', 'N,N-dimethylformamide', 'BCT3'], 'steps': ['Dissolve 1.74 g of PVDF in 20 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide at 60 °C.', 'Add 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 wt.% of BCT3 filler to the solution after four hours of mixing.', 'Stir the solution at 500 rpm on a hot plate for an additional four hours.', 'Cast the solution in a cleaned petri dish and anneal in an oven at 100 °C for 5 hours.', 'Peel off the obtained films from the glass petri dish and cut into square pieces.', 'Hot press the films at 100 °C with a pressure of 125 kg/cm².'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'FESEM-EDX', 'FTIR', 'dielectric measurements', 'PE hysteresis tracer', 'digital storage oscilloscope', 'electrometer', 'UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
