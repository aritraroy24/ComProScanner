**Description**: Format the extracted material composition and properties data. Focus on the 'Notes' if anything is provided. You MUST use 'MaterialParserTool' as tool if there is any variable in the composition in {'composition_extracted_data': {'compositions_property_values': {'PZT': 250, 'PZT - After diffusion bonding at 275 °C': 120, 'PZT - After 1st thermal cycle between 250 °C and room temperature': 120, 'PZT - After 10th thermal cycle between 250 °C and room temperature': 120, 'PZT - After repoling': 250}, 'abbreviations': {}, 'property_unit': 'pC/N', 'family': 'PZT'}}. You MUST use the final output from the material parser tool as the final answer for such cases. Just resolve the variables - but don't do any final numerical calculation to get the composition percentage by yourself and keep the formula same as the original.
- If any abbreviated form of composition is present rewrite with the actual composition. But DON'T modify the chemical composition / periodic element with chemical name / element name for e.g., Bi should not be replaced with Bismuth or BaTiO3 should not be replaced with Barium titanate.
- If composition has variables with equation, after resolving the variable the formula should be written in a form of BODMAS rule with only () as brackets, + as addition, - as subtraction, * as multiplication and / as division. For e.g, ABx-2y/5C3 is a chemical formula, where A, B, C are periodic elements and x and y are variables with values x=2, y=3, the final chemical formula should be written as AB(2-((2*3)/5))O3 so that BODMAS rule can be applied later.

**Description**: Format the extracted material composition and properties data. Focus on the 'Notes' if anything is provided. You MUST use 'MaterialParserTool' as tool if there is any variable in the composition in {'composition_extracted_data': {'compositions_property_values': {'PZT': 250, 'PZT - After diffusion bonding at 275 °C': 120, 'PZT - After 1st thermal cycle between 250 °C and room temperature': 120, 'PZT - After 10th thermal cycle between 250 °C and room temperature': 120, 'PZT - After repoling': 250}, 'abbreviations': {'PZT': 'Lead Zirconate Titanate'}, 'property_unit': 'pC/N', 'family': 'PZT'}}. You MUST use the final output from the material parser tool as the final answer for such cases. Just resolve the variables - but don't do any final numerical calculation to get the composition percentage by yourself and keep the formula same as the original.
- If any abbreviated form of composition is present rewrite with the actual composition. But DON'T modify the chemical composition / periodic element with chemical name / element name for e.g., Bi should not be replaced with Bismuth or BaTiO3 should not be replaced with Barium titanate.
- If composition has variables with equation, after resolving the variable the formula should be written in a form of BODMAS rule with only () as brackets, + as addition, - as subtraction, * as multiplication and / as division. For e.g, ABx-2y/5C3 is a chemical formula, where A, B, C are periodic elements and x and y are variables with values x=2, y=3, the final chemical formula should be written as AB(2-((2*3)/5))O3 so that BODMAS rule can be applied later.

**Parameters**:
- Extracted composition-property dictionary-
{'composition_extracted_data': {'compositions_property_values': {'PZT': 250, 'PZT - After diffusion bonding at 275 °C': 120, 'PZT - After 1st thermal cycle between 250 °C and room temperature': 120, 'PZT - After 10th thermal cycle between 250 °C and room temperature': 120, 'PZT - After repoling': 250}, 'abbreviations': {'PZT': 'Lead Zirconate Titanate'}, 'property_unit': 'pC/N', 'family': 'PZT'}}

The extracted output should look like the following-

{
  "compositions":
  {
    "Ba0.99Ca0.01Ti0.68Zr0.32O3": 375, 
    "Ba0.98Ca0.02Ti0.78Zr0.22O3": 350, 
    "Ba0.97Ca0.03Ti0.88Zr0.12O3": 325, 
    "Ba0.96Ca0.04Ti0.98Zr0.02O3": 300
  },
  "property_unit": "pC/N", 
  "family": "BaTiO3"
}

**Notes**:
- The unit, given here, along with other data, is just an example. It can change depending on the property.
", agent="Material Composition and Property Formatter", status="completed", output="Thought: I need to check if there are any variables in the composition that require resolution using the Material Formula Parser. In this case, the composition "PZT" does not contain any variables, so I can proceed to format the data without using the parser. Additionally, I need to replace the abbreviation "PZT" with its full name "Lead Zirconate Titanate" and ensure there are no duplicate entries.

Action: None needed as there are no variables to resolve.
