# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a) and (b) illustrate the dispersion stability of PZT slurries with varying dispersant contents. As shown, the sedimentation ratio of the ceramic slurry with 1 wt% BYK-111 is higher than that of the other slurries, remaining at 93.2 % even after 14 days. The sedimentation images of the PZT slurry further confirm that the slurry with 1 wt% BYK-111 exhibits minimal sedimentation and maintains sound dispersion stability, making it favorable for DLP printing of PZT slurries. For the accurate printing of PZT ceramic components, the slurry used in DLP printing must exhibit favorable rheological properties. (c) shows the viscosity versus shear rate curves for the ceramic slurries. The viscosities of the slurries containing 0.5, 1, and 2 wt% BYK-111 display significant shear thinning behavior as the shear rate increases, which can be attributed to the rearrangement of ceramic particles in the flow direction at higher shear rates. In contrast, the slurries with 3 and 4 wt% BYK-111 demonstrate highly unstable viscosities and exhibit shear thickening. Additionally, the viscosity of the slurry at 100 s\u207bE^{1} initially decreases and then increases with rising BYK-111 content, reaching a minimum value of 1.37 Pa\xb7s at 1 wt%. Notably, the viscosities of the slurries with 3 and 4 wt% BYK-111 are 5.15 and 8.74 Pa\xb7s, respectively, which are significantly higher than the maximum viscosity of 3 Pa\xb7s required for DLP printing. This indicates that these slurries are unsuitable for DLP printing. Consequently, the subsequent discussion will focus only on the properties of the ceramic slurries with BYK-111 contents of 0.5, 1, and 2 wt%. The shear stress curve in (d) was obtained by fitting the Herschel-Bulkey function , and the fitted equation is as follows: where \u03c4 represents the slurry shear stress, \u03c4 0 is the slurry yield stress during shear, K stands for the slurry consistency index, \u03b3 is the shear rate, n indicates the rheological index. All R E^{ } values exceed 0.999, indicating that the experimental data fit the Herschel-Bulkey model extremely well. Besides, the n value of the slurry with 1 wt% BYK-111 is 1.0168, which is closer to 1 compared to other slurries. Meanwhile, the rheological properties of the slurry containing 1 wt% BYK-111 are also demonstrated to be highly satisfactory. The influence of BYK-111 content on the dispersion stability and rheological behavior of ceramic slurry is thoroughly analyzed by investigating the modification mechanism of the ceramic particles. Notably, the particles modified with 1 wt% BYK-111 exhibit the highest absolute zeta potential value at 15.2 mV. As depicted in (b), for particles modified with 1 and 2 wt% BYK-111, a broad peak in the range of 3300\u20133600 cmE^{\u22121} is observed, which is associated with O-H stretching vibrations. Hydroxyl groups are capable of attracting charges, which results in an increase in the charge carried by the particle surfaces, leading to a larger zeta potential for the ceramic particles modified with 1 wt% BYK-111. A higher zeta potential value indicates greater electrostatic repulsion among particles in the ceramic slurry , which in turn leads to reduced particle agglomeration and enhanced dispersion stability of the slurry. (c)\u2013(f) visually depict the surfaces of modified PZT particles. The adsorption layer on the particles modified with 1 wt% BYK-111 displayed uniformity and a moderate thickness. In contrast, the adsorption layer appeared thin and sparse when the BYK-111 content was below this level and became overly thick when it exceeded this amount. As shown in (g), an optimal BYK-111 content ensures full modification of the particle surface without causing cross-linking of the dispersant molecular chains. The results demonstrate that a slurry containing 1 wt% BYK-111 achieves high dispersion stability and maintains a low viscosity of 1.37 Pa\xb7s. With insufficient BYK-111 content, only a few dispersant molecules adhere to the surface of the modified particles, leading to incomplete modification. Conversely, an excessive BYK-111 content results in excessive adsorption of dispersant molecules on the particle surface, leading to cross-linking and entanglement at the ends of the molecular chains. The curing behavior of the PZT slurry is evaluated with respect to the printing accuracy of the ceramic components. The accuracy test models for PZT slurries at different exposure energies are illustrated in (a). At an exposure energy of 55 mJ/cmE^{2}, three distinct circles are clearly visible in the model using the 1 wt% BYK-111 slurry. In contrast, the smallest circle in the slurries with 0.5 and 2 wt% BYK-111 is partially or fully obscured by the over-curing layer. Interestingly, the circles remain discernible in the model with 1 wt% BYK-111 slurry across all exposure energies. Notably, at an exposure energy of 275 mJ/cmE^{2}, although the circle edges show signs of over-curing, a circle is still observable. For the slurries with 0.5 and 2 wt% BYK-111, severe over-curing occurs in the accuracy test model when exposure energies exceed 165 mJ/cmE^{2}, resulting in the circles being completely enveloped by the over-curing layer. It is considered to be caused by UV light scattering during the printing process. This phenomenon can intensify UV light scattering during printed process. The slurry containing 1 wt% BYK-111 has better dispersion stability, which improves printing accuracy at identical exposure energy. These observations indicate that the slurry with 1 wt% BYK-111 maintains high printing accuracy at comparable exposure energies. (b) depicts the variation of curing depth with exposure energy for the ceramic slurries. However, the differences in the curing depth of slurries with varying BYK-111 contents at the same exposure energy are minimal. Despite this, the printing accuracy of these slurries shows clear distinctions. (c) uses the Beer-Lambert theory  to further clarify the reasons behind these discrepancies in printing accuracy. where C d represents the curing depth (\u03bcm), D p the penetration depth (\u03bcm), E i the surface energy density (mJ/cmE^{2}), and E c denotes the critical exposure energy density (mJ/cmE^{2}). It is noteworthy that ceramic slurries with 1 wt% BYK-111 exhibit the lowest D p and E c. Lower E c values allow the slurry to cure at reduced exposure energies and minimize the scattering of UV light during the printing process. Consequently, this slurry achieves superior printing accuracy at the same exposure energy compared to slurries with 0.5 and 2 wt% BYK-111, thus providing favorable conditions for producing printed PZT ceramic components with high surface quality. The SEM images and corresponding 3D profiles of the surfaces of printed ceramic components are displayed in (a)\u2013(c). On the surface of the ceramic component with 0.5 wt% BYK-111, a substantial number of large bulges and pores are observed. At a BYK-111 content of 1 wt%, these large bulges have transformed into smaller particles, resulting in a noticeably flatter surface. However, increasing the BYK-111 content further to 2 wt% leads to increased particle agglomeration on the surface once again. The poor dispersion stability of the ceramic slurries with 0.5 and 2 wt% BYK-111 causes particle agglomeration during printing, which is evident from the large bulges shown in (a). In contrast, the high dispersion stability and rheological properties of the ceramic slurry with 1 wt% BYK-111 prevent particle agglomeration during the printing process, thus enhancing the surface quality of the printed ceramic components. As shown in (d), the ceramic component with 0.5 wt% BYK-111 exhibits the highest S a value of 161.5 nm. In contrast, the component with 1 wt% BYK-111 demonstrates the lowest S a value of 69.3 nm, representing a 57.1 % improvement in surface flatness compared to the former. Additionally, the height difference between the highest and lowest points of the measured surface, S z , and the surface peak density, S ds , as indicated in Equation , are used as spatial parameters to quantify the undulation and the number of peaks on the surface. where S ds represents the surface peak density (mmE^{\u22122}), N the number of peaks on the measured inner surface. Increasing the amount of BYK-111 initially leads to a decrease and then an increase in both S z and S ds values, with a minimum observed at 1 wt%, where the values are 2.55 \u03bcm and 8099.1 mmE^{\u22122}, respectively. This suggests that an optimized content of BYK-111 is beneficial for enhancing the surface quality of printed ceramic components. The thermogravimetric (TG) results of printed green bodies with different dispersant contents are shown in (a)\u2013(c). The TG curves show that the mass loss process during debinding can be divided into two stages (160\u2013440 \xb0C), corresponding to two exothermic peaks near 350 \xb0C and 410 \xb0C in the DTG curves. Specifically, all the samples showed the highest mass loss in stage I, and the stage I mass loss increased from 9.1 % to 9.8 % with increasing dispersant content. The mass loss in Stage II is much lower compared to Stage I, but the mass loss can still exceed 1 %, indicating that a small amount of organic matter is still decomposing in the Stage II green body. In addition, the DTG curves show that the temperature of the main pyrolysis peaks does not change much as the dispersant content increases. The degreasing stage was carried out from room temperature to 600 \xb0C at a temperature increase rate of 0.2 \xb0C/min, and was held at 360, 415 and 600 \xb0C for 2 h each to ensure complete decomposition of the organic matter. It was then heated to 1180 \xb0C at a rate of 5 \xb0C/min, held for 2 h, and allowed to cool naturally to room temperature. (a)\u2013(c) shows the cross-sectional SEM images of the printed PZT green bodies. All the printed PZT green bodies exhibited strong interlayer bonding. However, the cross-section of the green body with 0.5 wt% BYK-111 showed significant particle agglomeration, which can lead to a deterioration in the surface quality of the printed ceramics, consistent with the phenomenon illustrated in (a). The green bodies with 1 and 2 wt% BYK-111 displayed significantly better dispersion, especially the one with 1 wt% BYK-111, which exhibited minimal agglomeration. The microstructure of the sintered ceramics, as shown in (d)\u2013(f), further confirms the denser structure of the ceramics with 1 wt% BYK-111 compared to those with other dispersant contents. As a result of this dense structure, the printed ceramic with 1 wt% BYK-111 exhibited the lowest radial and axial shrinkage, at 16.63 % and 16.33 %, respectively, as shown in. Moreover, the density of the ceramic reached approximately 7.15 g/cmE^{3} in (h), which is 95.3 % of that of dry-pressed ceramics and is superior to the results of some other 3D-printed lead-based ceramics. The polarization-electric field (P-E) loops, strain-electric field (S-E) curves, and piezoelectric constants of the printed PZT ceramics were measured. As shown in (a), the ferroelectric hysteresis loops are symmetrical, with the remnant polarization (P r ) of the printed ceramic with 1 wt% BYK-111 reaching 32.2 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, approximately 94.15 % of that of dry-pressed ceramic. In (b), the strain of the printed ceramic under an electric field of 40 kV/cm is 0.223 %, which is only 0.011 % lower than that of dry-pressed ceramics. The printed ceramics in this study are cylindrical, with a diameter of 8.5 mm and a height of 2.5 mm. The d 33 value of the printed ceramics is approximately 445 pC/N, as shown in (c), which is superior to the results of most current studies on 3D-printed macro-sized piezoelectric ceramics. Although the d 33 value of PZT ceramics (raw material d 33 = 630 pC/N) printed by Lu et al. reached 583 pC/N , the prepared ceramics were rectangular, with dimensions of 3 mm in length, 2.6 mm in width, and 0.2 mm in height. Due to its smaller dimensions, particularly its thickness, which is only 10 % of the printed ceramics in this work, the incidence of defects is lower, resulting in a higher d 33 value. Various piezoelectric structures were designed and fabricated, including 1\u20133, 1-3-2, and 3-1 arrays for piezoelectric transducers, as well as a helical structure for use in piezoelectric actuators, as shown in (a)\u2013(d). The printed AE sensor was produced by encapsulating the 1\u20133 piezoelectric array depicted in (b), as illustrated in (e). The signal amplitudes received by both sensors, as shown in (f), were approximately the same, around 93 dB. Notably, the printed sensor exhibited a substrate noise level of 31 dB, which is lower than the 34 dB observed in the commercial sensor. This results in a signal-to-noise ratio of 62 dB for the printed sensor, compared to 59 dB for the commercial sensor. This heightened sensitivity is advantageous for AE sensors used in structural health monitoring. In contrast, the commercial sensor exhibits a significant secondary reflection wave at 0.235 ms, which can reduce signal reception accuracy. The test results for the frequency domain signal waveforms, shown in (i), indicate that the operating frequency ranges of both sensors are nearly identical, functioning properly within the 1 kHz\u2013500 kHz range.

# TITLE
Adjusting the surface quality of printed components via controlling dispersant content to improve the electrical performance of DLP-printed PZT ceramics and devices

# ABSTRACT
This paper aims to enhance the surface quality of digital light processing (DLP) printed lead zirconate titanate (PZT) components by controlling the content of BYK-111 dispersant, thereby improving the electrical properties of the resulting printed piezoelectric ceramics and devices. 55Â vol% high solid loading PZT slurries with different dispersant contents were prepared and assessed for their dispersion stability, rheological behavior and curing characteristics. The slurry containing 1Â wt% BYK-111 demonstrated ideal rheological properties, notably achieving a low viscosity of 1.37Â PaÂ·s at 100 sâ1. The surface roughness of the printed ceramic component was reduced to 69.3Â nm, representing a 57.1Â % improvement in surface quality compared to other dispersant levels. The printed PZT ceramic exhibited superior piezoelectric performance, with a piezoelectric constant d33
                      reaching 445Â pC/N, surpassing most existing 3D-printed macro-sized piezoelectric ceramics. Furthermore, a DLP-printed 1â3 piezoelectric array was encapsulated to fabricate an acoustic emission (AE) sensor, which achieved a low substrate noise level of 31Â dB and a high signal-to-noise ratio of 62Â dB, outperforming commercial sensors. The optimal BYK-111 content not only ensures favorable dispersion stability and rheological properties in the slurry, but also significantly enhances the surface quality and density of the printed ceramic components, ultimately leading to the production of high-performance piezoelectric ceramics and devices.

# INTRODUCTION
Among these materials, lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoelectric ceramics, known for their high piezoelectric constants and electromechanical coupling coefficients, are widely used as core components in electronic devices, including filters, sensors, and transducers. Ceramic slurry is the foundation and key element of DLP technology, primarily composed of dispersants, photosensitive resins, and ceramic particles. For instance, Sun  and Zhang et al.  developed zirconia ceramic slurries with superior dispersion stability and viscosities below 1.50 Pa\xb7s by optimizing the dispersant content, successfully printing zirconia ceramic components. Xu  and Zhang et al.  adjusted the type of dispersant so as to achieve alumina slurries with solid loadings exceeding 45 vol% and viscosities under 2.00 Pa\xb7s, resulting in ideal self-leveling behavior. Jiao et al.  used an appropriate quantity of 1 wt% KOS110 dispersant and 2 wt% PEG300 thickener to achieve both a 55 vol% high solid loading and a low viscosity of 3.04 Pa\xb7s for PZT slurry. In their study, Liu et al.  selected suitable dispersants (1 wt% KH560 and 1 wt% Darvan) to prepare a Si3N4 slurry with moderate viscosity and a curing depth of up to 50 \u03bcm, enabling the printing of dense Si3N4 ceramics (3.28 g/cm\xb3) by stereolithography (SLA). Liu et al.  employed Triton X-100 dispersant to prepare 80 wt% solid loading BaTiO3 slurry with a curing depth exceeding 45 \u03bcm, resulting in DLP-printed BaTiO3 ceramics with a piezoelectric constant d 33 of 168.1 pC/N. Liu et al.  used Solsperse 41000 dispersant to fabricate PZT slurry with a curing depth of 43 \u03bcm, leading to the production of PZT piezoelectric ceramics with exceptional electrical properties (d 33 = 365 pC/N) via vat photopolymerization (VPP). To address this issue, Kim et al.  successfully improved the printing accuracy and surface quality of ceramic components by optimizing the dispersant content, reducing the surface roughness (S a ) of the printed ceramics to approximately 1.2 \u03bcm. However, this work focused exclusively on the impact of dispersant content in ceramic slurries with lower solid loading (80 wt%), and the resulting surface roughness remained at the micrometer level. This paper presents a systematic investigation into the effect of BYK-111 dispersant content on the performance of high solid loading PZT slurries and the surface quality and electrical properties of DLP-printed ceramic components. A series of 55 vol% PZT slurries with varying BYK-111 contents were prepared. The study examines the impact of BYK-111 content on the slurry's stability and rheological behavior, elucidating the modification mechanism of the dispersant on ceramic particles. The performance of the printed PZT piezoelectric ceramics and the corresponding acoustic emission (AE) sensor was also assessed, confirming the effectiveness of the printed piezoelectric ceramics and devices.

# CONCLUSION
This work aims to enhance the performance of PZT slurries and improve the surface quality of the printed ceramic components by optimizing the BYK-111 dispersant content, ultimately advancing the electrical performance of the printed ceramics and devices. The study successfully prepared 55 vol% high solid loading PZT slurries with varying BYK-111 contents and evaluated their dispersion stability, rheological properties, and curing behavior. The PZT slurry containing 1 wt% BYK-111 exhibited the best dispersion stability, with a low viscosity of 1.37 Pa\xb7s, and demonstrated superior printing accuracy. The surface roughness of the printed ceramic components was reduced to 69.3 nm, with surface flatness improved by 57.1 % compared to components with other dispersant contents. Additionally, the printed PZT ceramic achieved a density of 7.15 g/cmE^{3} and a relative density of 95.3 %. The ceramic also displayed robust piezoelectric properties, particularly a d 33 value of 445 pC/N, surpassing most existing results for 3D-printed macro-sized piezoelectric ceramics. Furthermore, a 1\u20133 piezoelectric array was printed, and an AE sensor was fabricated by encapsulating this structure. The sensor achieved a signal amplitude of 93 dB, with a substrate noise as low as 31 dB and a high signal-to-noise ratio of 62 dB, exceeding the performance of commercial sensors, thereby indicating favorable signal accuracy.

As depicted in (b), for particles modified with 1 and 2 wt% BYK-111, a broad peak in the range of 3300\u20133600 cmE^{\u22121} is observed, which is associated with O-H stretching vibrations. Hydroxyl groups are capable of attracting charges, which results in an increase in the charge carried by the particle surfaces, leading to a larger zeta potential for the ceramic particles modified with 1 wt% BYK-111. A higher zeta potential value indicates greater electrostatic repulsion among particles in the ceramic slurry , which in turn leads to reduced particle agglomeration and enhanced dispersion stability of the slurry. (c)\u2013(f) visually depict the surfaces of modified PZT particles. The adsorption layer on the particles modified with 1 wt% BYK-111 displayed uniformity and a moderate thickness. In contrast, the adsorption layer appeared thin and sparse when the BYK-111 content was below this level and became overly thick when it exceeded this amount. As shown in (g), an optimal BYK-111 content ensures full modification of the particle surface without causing cross-linking of the dispersant molecular chains. The results demonstrate that a slurry containing 1 wt% BYK-111 achieves high dispersion stability and maintains a low viscosity of 1.37 Pa\xb7s. With insufficient BYK-111 content, only a few dispersant molecules adhere to the surface of the modified particles, leading to incomplete modification. Conversely, an excessive BYK-111 content results in excessive adsorption of dispersant molecules on the particle surface, leading to cross-linking and entanglement at the ends of the molecular chains. The curing behavior of the PZT slurry is evaluated with respect to the printing accuracy of the ceramic components. The accuracy test models for PZT slurries at different exposure energies are illustrated in (a). At an exposure energy of 55 mJ/cmE^{2}, three distinct circles are clearly visible in the model using the 1 wt% BYK-111 slurry. In contrast, the smallest circle in the slurries with 0.5 and 2 wt% BYK-111 is partially or fully obscured by the over-curing layer. Interestingly, the circles remain discernible in the model with 1 wt% BYK-111 slurry across all exposure energies. Notably, at an exposure energy of 275 mJ/cmE^{2}, although the circle edges show signs of over-curing, a circle is still observable. For the slurries with 0.5 and 2 wt% BYK-111, severe over-curing occurs in the accuracy test model when exposure energies exceed 165 mJ/cmE^{2}, resulting in the circles being completely enveloped by the over-curing layer. It is considered to be caused by UV light scattering during the printing process. This phenomenon can intensify UV light scattering during printed process. The slurry containing 1 wt% BYK-111 has better dispersion stability, which improves printing accuracy at identical exposure energy. These observations indicate that the slurry with 1 wt% BYK-111 maintains high printing accuracy at comparable exposure energies. (b) depicts the variation of curing depth with exposure energy for the ceramic slurries. However, the differences in the curing depth of slurries with varying BYK-111 contents at the same exposure energy are minimal. Despite this, the printing accuracy of these slurries shows clear distinctions. (c) uses the Beer-Lambert theory  to further clarify the reasons behind these discrepancies in printing accuracy. where C d represents the curing depth (\u03bcm), D p the penetration depth (\u03bcm), E i the surface energy density (mJ/cmE^{2}), and E c denotes the critical exposure energy density (mJ/cmE^{2}). It is noteworthy that ceramic slurries with 1 wt% BYK-111 exhibit the lowest D p and E c. Lower E c values allow the slurry to cure at reduced exposure energies and minimize the scattering of UV light during the printing process. Consequently, this slurry achieves superior printing accuracy at the same exposure energy compared to slurries with 0.5 and 2 wt% BYK-111, thus providing favorable conditions for producing printed PZT ceramic components with high surface quality. The SEM images and corresponding 3D profiles of the surfaces of printed ceramic components are displayed in (a)\u2013(c). On the surface of the ceramic component with 0.5 wt% BYK-111, a substantial number of large bulges and pores are observed. At a BYK-111 content of 1 wt%, these large bulges have transformed into smaller particles, resulting in a noticeably flatter surface. However, increasing the BYK-111 content further to 2 wt% leads to increased particle agglomeration on the surface once again. The poor dispersion stability of the ceramic slurries with 0.5 and 2 wt% BYK-111 causes particle agglomeration during printing, which is evident from the large bulges shown in (a). In contrast, the high dispersion stability and rheological properties of the ceramic slurry with 1 wt% BYK-111 prevent particle agglomeration during the printing process, thus enhancing the surface quality of the printed ceramic components. As shown in (d), the ceramic component with 0.5 wt% BYK-111 exhibits the highest S a value of 161.5 nm. In contrast, the component with 1 wt% BYK-111 demonstrates the lowest S a value of 69.3 nm, representing a 57.1 % improvement in surface flatness compared to the former. Additionally, the height difference between the highest and lowest points of the measured surface, S z , and the surface peak density, S ds , as indicated in Equation , are used as spatial parameters to quantify the undulation and the number of peaks on the surface. where S ds represents the surface peak density (mmE^{\u22122}), N the number of peaks on the measured inner surface. Increasing the amount of BYK-111 initially leads to a decrease and then an increase in both S z and S ds values, with a minimum observed at 1 wt%, where the values are 2.55 \u03bcm and 8099.1 mmE^{\u22122}, respectively. This suggests that an optimized content of BYK-111 is beneficial for enhancing the surface quality of printed ceramic components. The thermogravimetric (TG) results of printed green bodies with different dispersant contents are shown in (a)\u2013(c). The TG curves show that the mass loss process during debinding can be divided into two stages (160\u2013440 \xb0C), corresponding to two exothermic peaks near 350 \xb0C and 410 \xb0C in the DTG curves. Specifically, all the samples showed the highest mass loss in stage I, and the stage I mass loss increased from 9.1 % to 9.8 % with increasing dispersant content. The mass loss in Stage II is much lower compared to Stage I, but the mass loss can still exceed 1 %, indicating that a small amount of organic matter is still decomposing in the Stage II green body. In addition, the DTG curves show that the temperature of the main pyrolysis peaks does not change much as the dispersant content increases. The degreasing stage was carried out from room temperature to 600 \xb0C at a temperature increase rate of 0.2 \xb0C/min, and was held at 360, 415 and 600 \xb0C for 2 h each to ensure complete decomposition of the organic matter. It was then heated to 1180 \xb0C at a rate of 5 \xb0C/min, held for 2 h, and allowed to cool naturally to room temperature. (a)\u2013(c) shows the cross-sectional SEM images of the printed PZT green bodies. All the printed PZT green bodies exhibited strong interlayer bonding. However, the cross-section of the green body with 0.5 wt% BYK-111 showed significant particle agglomeration, which can lead to a deterioration in the surface quality of the printed ceramics, consistent with the phenomenon illustrated in (a). The green bodies with 1 and 2 wt% BYK-111 displayed significantly better dispersion, especially the one with 1 wt% BYK-111, which exhibited minimal agglomeration. The microstructure of the sintered ceramics, as shown in (d)\u2013(f), further confirms the denser structure of the ceramics with 1 wt% BYK-111 compared to those with other dispersant contents. As a result of this dense structure, the printed ceramic with 1 wt% BYK-111 exhibited the lowest radial and axial shrinkage, at 16.63 % and 16.33 %, respectively, as shown in. Moreover, the density of the ceramic reached approximately 7.15 g/cmE^{3} in (h), which is 95.3 % of that of dry-pressed ceramics and is superior to the results of some other 3D-printed lead-based ceramics. The polarization-electric field (P-E) loops, strain-electric field (S-E) curves, and piezoelectric constants of the printed PZT ceramics were measured. As shown in (a), the ferroelectric hysteresis loops are symmetrical, with the remnant polarization (P r ) of the printed ceramic with 1 wt% BYK-111 reaching 32.2 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, approximately 94.15 % of that of dry-pressed ceramic. In (b), the strain of the printed ceramic under an electric field of 40 kV/cm is 0.223 %, which is only 0.011 % lower than that of dry-pressed ceramics. The printed ceramics in this study are cylindrical, with a diameter of 8.5 mm and a height of 2.5 mm. The d 33 value of the printed ceramics is approximately 445 pC/N, as shown in (c), which is superior to the results of most current studies on 3D-printed macro-sized piezoelectric ceramics. Although the d 33 value of PZT ceramics (raw material d 33 = 630 pC/N) printed by Lu et al. reached 583 pC/N , the prepared ceramics were rectangular, with dimensions of 3 mm in length, 2.6 mm in width, and 0.2 mm in height. Due to its smaller dimensions, particularly its thickness, which is only 10 % of the printed ceramics in this work, the incidence of defects is lower, resulting in a higher d 33 value. Various piezoelectric structures were designed and fabricated, including 1\u20133, 1-3-2, and 3-1 arrays for piezoelectric transducers, as well as a helical structure for use in piezoelectric actuators, as shown in (a)\u2013(d). The printed AE sensor was produced by encapsulating the 1\u20133 piezoelectric array depicted in (b), as illustrated in (e). The signal amplitudes received by both sensors, as shown in (f), were approximately the same, around 93 dB. Notably, the printed sensor exhibited a substrate noise level of 31 dB, which is lower than the 34 dB observed in the commercial sensor. This results in a signal-to-noise ratio of 62 dB for the printed sensor, compared to 59 dB for the commercial sensor. This heightened sensitivity is advantageous for AE sensors used in structural health monitoring. In contrast, the commercial sensor exhibits a significant secondary reflection wave at 0.235 ms, which can reduce signal reception accuracy. The test results for the frequency domain signal waveforms, shown in (i), indicate that the operating frequency ranges of both sensors are nearly identical, functioning properly within the 1 kHz\u2013500 kHz range.

# TITLE
Adjusting the surface quality of printed components via controlling dispersant content to improve the electrical performance of DLP-printed PZT ceramics and devices

# ABSTRACT
This paper aims to enhance the surface quality of digital light processing (DLP) printed lead zirconate titanate (PZT) components by controlling the content of BYK-111 dispersant, thereby improving the electrical properties of the resulting printed piezoelectric ceramics and devices. 55Â vol% high solid loading PZT slurries with different dispersant contents were prepared and assessed for their dispersion stability, rheological behavior and curing characteristics. The slurry containing 1Â wt% BYK-111 demonstrated ideal rheological properties, notably achieving a low viscosity of 1.37Â PaÂ·s at 100 sâ1. The surface roughness of the printed ceramic component was reduced to 69.3Â nm, representing a 57.1Â % improvement in surface quality compared to other dispersant levels. The printed PZT ceramic exhibited superior piezoelectric performance, with a piezoelectric constant d33
                      reaching 445Â pC/N, surpassing most existing 3D-printed macro-sized piezoelectric ceramics. Furthermore, a DLP-printed 1â3 piezoelectric array was encapsulated to fabricate an acoustic emission (AE) sensor, which achieved a low substrate noise level of 31Â dB and a high signal-to-noise ratio of 62Â dB, outperforming commercial sensors. The optimal BYK-111 content not only ensures favorable dispersion stability and rheological properties in the slurry, but also significantly enhances the surface quality and density of the printed ceramic components, ultimately leading to the production of high-performance piezoelectric ceramics and devices.

# INTRODUCTION
Among these materials, lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoelectric ceramics, known for their high piezoelectric constants and electromechanical coupling coefficients, are widely used as core components in electronic devices, including filters, sensors, and transducers. Ceramic slurry is the foundation and key element of DLP technology, primarily composed of dispersants, photosensitive resins, and ceramic particles. For instance, Sun  and Zhang et al.  developed zirconia ceramic slurries with superior dispersion stability and viscosities below 1.50 Pa\xb7s by optimizing the dispersant content, successfully printing zirconia ceramic components. Xu  and Zhang et al.  adjusted the type of dispersant so as to achieve alumina slurries with solid loadings exceeding 45 vol% and viscosities under 2.00 Pa\xb7s, resulting in ideal self-leveling behavior. Jiao et al.  used an appropriate quantity of 1 wt% KOS110 dispersant and 2 wt% PEG300 thickener to achieve both a 55 vol% high solid loading and a low viscosity of 3.04 Pa\xb7s for PZT slurry. In their study, Liu et al.  selected suitable dispersants (1 wt% KH560 and 1 wt% Darvan) to prepare a Si3N4 slurry with moderate viscosity and a curing depth of up to 50 \u03bcm, enabling the printing of dense Si3N4 ceramics (3.28 g/cm\xb3) by stereolithography (SLA). Liu et al.  employed Triton X-100 dispersant to prepare 80 wt% solid loading BaTiO3 slurry with a curing depth exceeding 45 \u03bcm, resulting in DLP-printed BaTiO3 ceramics with a piezoelectric constant d 33 of 168.1 pC/N. Liu et al.  used Solsperse 41000 dispersant to fabricate PZT slurry with a curing depth of 43 \u03bcm, leading to the production of PZT piezoelectric ceramics with exceptional electrical properties (d 33 = 365 pC/N) via vat photopolymerization (VPP). To address this issue, Kim et al.  successfully improved the printing accuracy and surface quality of ceramic components by optimizing the dispersant content, reducing the surface roughness (S a ) of the printed ceramics to approximately 1.2 \u03bcm. However, this work focused exclusively on the impact of dispersant content in ceramic slurries with lower solid loading (80 wt%), and the resulting surface roughness remained at the micrometer level. This paper presents a systematic investigation into the effect of BYK-111 dispersant content on the performance of high solid loading PZT slurries and the surface quality and electrical properties of DLP-printed ceramic components. A series of 55 vol% PZT slurries with varying BYK-111 contents were prepared. The study examines the impact of BYK-111 content on the slurry's stability and rheological behavior, elucidating the modification mechanism of the dispersant on ceramic particles. The performance of the printed PZT piezoelectric ceramics and the corresponding acoustic emission (AE) sensor was also assessed, confirming the effectiveness of the printed piezoelectric ceramics and devices.

# CONCLUSION
This work aims to enhance the performance of PZT slurries and improve the surface quality of the printed ceramic components by optimizing the BYK-111 dispersant content, ultimately advancing the electrical performance of the printed ceramics and devices. The study successfully prepared 55 vol% high solid loading PZT slurries with varying BYK-111 contents and evaluated their dispersion stability, rheological properties, and curing behavior. The PZT slurry containing 1 wt% BYK-111 exhibited the best dispersion stability, with a low viscosity of 1.37 Pa\xb7s, and demonstrated superior printing accuracy. The surface roughness of the printed ceramic components was reduced to 69.3 nm, with surface flatness improved by 57.1 % compared to components with other dispersant contents. Additionally, the printed PZT ceramic achieved a density of 7.15 g/cmE^{3} and a relative density of 95.3 %. The ceramic also displayed robust piezoelectric properties, particularly a d 33 value of 445 pC/N, surpassing most existing results for 3D-printed macro-sized piezoelectric ceramics. Furthermore, a 1\u20133 piezoelectric array was printed, and an AE sensor was fabricated by encapsulating this structure. The sensor achieved a signal amplitude of 93 dB, with a substrate noise as low as 31 dB and a high signal-to-noise ratio of 62 dB, exceeding the performance of commercial sensors, thereby indicating favorable signal accuracy.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a) and (b) illustrate the dispersion stability of PZT slurries with varying dispersant contents. As shown, the sedimentation ratio of the ceramic slurry with 1 wt% BYK-111 is higher than that of the other slurries, remaining at 93.2 % even after 14 days. The sedimentation images of the PZT slurry further confirm that the slurry with 1 wt% BYK-111 exhibits minimal sedimentation and maintains sound dispersion stability, making it favorable for DLP printing of PZT slurries. For the accurate printing of PZT ceramic components, the slurry used in DLP printing must exhibit favorable rheological properties. (c) shows the viscosity versus shear rate curves for the ceramic slurries. The viscosities of the slurries containing 0.5, 1, and 2 wt% BYK-111 display significant shear thinning behavior as the shear rate increases, which can be attributed to the rearrangement of ceramic particles in the flow direction at higher shear rates. In contrast, the slurries with 3 and 4 wt% BYK-111 demonstrate highly unstable viscosities and exhibit shear thickening. Additionally, the viscosity of the slurry at 100 s\u207bE^{1} initially decreases and then increases with rising BYK-111 content, reaching a minimum value of 1.37 Pa\xb7s at 1 wt%. Notably, the viscosities of the slurries with 3 and 4 wt% BYK-111 are 5.15 and 8.74 Pa\xb7s, respectively, which are significantly higher than the maximum viscosity of 3 Pa\xb7s required for DLP printing. This indicates that these slurries are unsuitable for DLP printing. Consequently, the subsequent discussion will focus only on the properties of the ceramic slurries with BYK-111 contents of 0.5, 1, and 2 wt%. The shear stress curve in (d) was obtained by fitting the Herschel-Bulkey function , and the fitted equation is as follows: where \u03c4 represents the slurry shear stress, \u03c4 0 is the slurry yield stress during shear, K stands for the slurry consistency index, \u03b3 is the shear rate, n indicates the rheological index. All R E^{ } values exceed 0.999, indicating that the experimental data fit the Herschel-Bulkey model extremely well. Besides, the n value of the slurry with 1 wt% BYK-111 is 1.0168, which is closer to 1 compared to other slurries. Meanwhile, the rheological properties of the slurry containing 1 wt% BYK-111 are also demonstrated to be highly satisfactory. The influence of BYK-111 content on the dispersion stability and rheological behavior of ceramic slurry is thoroughly analyzed by investigating the modification mechanism of the ceramic particles. Notably, the particles modified with 1 wt% BYK-111 exhibit the highest absolute zeta potential value at 15.2 mV. As depicted in (b), for particles modified with 1 and 2 wt% BYK-111, a broad peak in the range of 3300\u20133600 cmE^{\u22121} is observed, which is associated with O-H stretching vibrations. Hydroxyl groups are capable of attracting charges, which results in an increase in the charge carried by the particle surfaces, leading to a larger zeta potential for the ceramic particles modified with 1 wt% BYK-111. A higher zeta potential value indicates greater electrostatic repulsion among particles in the ceramic slurry , which in turn leads to reduced particle agglomeration and enhanced dispersion stability of the slurry. (c)\u2013(f) visually depict the surfaces of modified PZT particles. The adsorption layer on the particles modified with 1 wt% BYK-111 displayed uniformity and a moderate thickness. In contrast, the adsorption layer appeared thin and sparse when the BYK-111 content was below this level and became overly thick when it exceeded this amount. As shown in (g), an optimal BYK-111 content ensures full modification of the particle surface without causing cross-linking of the dispersant molecular chains. The results demonstrate that a slurry containing 1 wt% BYK-111 achieves high dispersion stability and maintains a low viscosity of 1.37 Pa\xb7s. With insufficient BYK-111 content, only a few dispersant molecules adhere to the surface of the modified particles, leading to incomplete modification. Conversely, an excessive BYK-111 content results in excessive adsorption of dispersant molecules on the particle surface, leading to cross-linking and entanglement at the ends of the molecular chains. The curing behavior of the PZT slurry is evaluated with respect to the printing accuracy of the ceramic components. The accuracy test models for PZT slurries at different exposure energies are illustrated in (a). At an exposure energy of 55 mJ/cmE^{2}, three distinct circles are clearly visible in the model using the 1 wt% BYK-111 slurry. In contrast, the smallest circle in the slurries with 0.5 and 2 wt% BYK-111 is partially or fully obscured by the over-curing layer. Interestingly, the circles remain discernible in the model with 1 wt% BYK-111 slurry across all exposure energies. Notably, at an exposure energy of 275 mJ/cmE^{2}, although the circle edges show signs of over-curing, a circle is still observable. For the slurries with 0.5 and 2 wt% BYK-111, severe over-curing occurs in the accuracy test model when exposure energies exceed 165 mJ/cmE^{2}, resulting in the circles being completely enveloped by the over-curing layer. It is considered to be caused by UV light scattering during the printing process. This phenomenon can intensify UV light scattering during printed process. The slurry containing 1 wt% BYK-111 has better dispersion stability, which improves printing accuracy at identical exposure energy. These observations indicate that the slurry with 1 wt% BYK-111 maintains high printing accuracy at comparable exposure energies. (b) depicts the variation of curing depth with exposure energy for the ceramic slurries. However, the differences in the curing depth of slurries with varying BYK-111 contents at the same exposure energy are minimal. Despite this, the printing accuracy of these slurries shows clear distinctions. (c) uses the Beer-Lambert theory  to further clarify the reasons behind these discrepancies in printing accuracy. where C d represents the curing depth (\u03bcm), D p the penetration depth (\u03bcm), E i the surface energy density (mJ/cmE^{2}), and E c denotes the critical exposure energy density (mJ/cmE^{2}). It is noteworthy that ceramic slurries with 1 wt% BYK-111 exhibit the lowest D p and E c. Lower E c values allow the slurry to cure at reduced exposure energies and minimize the scattering of UV light during the printing process. Consequently, this slurry achieves superior printing accuracy at the same exposure energy compared to slurries with 0.5 and 2 wt% BYK-111, thus providing favorable conditions for producing printed PZT ceramic components with high surface quality. The SEM images and corresponding 3D profiles of the surfaces of printed ceramic components are displayed in (a)\u2013(c). On the surface of the ceramic component with 0.5 wt% BYK-111, a substantial number of large bulges and pores are observed. At a BYK-111 content of 1 wt%, these large bulges have transformed into smaller particles, resulting in a noticeably flatter surface. However, increasing the BYK-111 content further to 2 wt% leads to increased particle agglomeration on the surface once again. The poor dispersion stability of the ceramic slurries with 0.5 and 2 wt% BYK-111 causes particle agglomeration during printing, which is evident from the large bulges shown in (a). In contrast, the high dispersion stability and rheological properties of the ceramic slurry with 1 wt% BYK-111 prevent particle agglomeration during the printing process, thus enhancing the surface quality of the printed ceramic components. As shown in (d), the ceramic component with 0.5 wt% BYK-111 exhibits the highest S a value of 161.5 nm. In contrast, the component with 1 wt% BYK-111 demonstrates the lowest S a value of 69.3 nm, representing a 57.1 % improvement in surface flatness compared to the former. Additionally, the height difference between the highest and lowest points of the measured surface, S z , and the surface peak density, S ds , as indicated in Equation , are used as spatial parameters to quantify the undulation and the number of peaks on the surface. where S ds represents the surface peak density (mmE^{\u22122}), N the number of peaks on the measured inner surface. Increasing the amount of BYK-111 initially leads to a decrease and then an increase in both S z and S ds values, with a minimum observed at 1 wt%, where the values are 2.55 \u03bcm and 8099.1 mmE^{\u22122}, respectively. This suggests that an optimized content of BYK-111 is beneficial for enhancing the surface quality of printed ceramic components. The thermogravimetric (TG) results of printed green bodies with different dispersant contents are shown in (a)\u2013(c). The TG curves show that the mass loss process during debinding can be divided into two stages (160\u2013440 \xb0C), corresponding to two exothermic peaks near 350 \xb0C and 410 \xb0C in the DTG curves. Specifically, all the samples showed the highest mass loss in stage I, and the stage I mass loss increased from 9.1 % to 9.8 % with increasing dispersant content. The mass loss in Stage II is much lower compared to Stage I, but the mass loss can still exceed 1 %, indicating that a small amount of organic matter is still decomposing in the Stage II green body. In addition, the DTG curves show that the temperature of the main pyrolysis peaks does not change much as the dispersant content increases. The degreasing stage was carried out from room temperature to 600 \xb0C at a temperature increase rate of 0.2 \xb0C/min, and was held at 360, 415 and 600 \xb0C for 2 h each to ensure complete decomposition of the organic matter. It was then heated to 1180 \xb0C at a rate of 5 \xb0C/min, held for 2 h, and allowed to cool naturally to room temperature. (a)\u2013(c) shows the cross-sectional SEM images of the printed PZT green bodies. All the printed PZT green bodies exhibited strong interlayer bonding. However, the cross-section of the green body with 0.5 wt% BYK-111 showed significant particle agglomeration, which can lead to a deterioration in the surface quality of the printed ceramics, consistent with the phenomenon illustrated in (a). The green bodies with 1 and 2 wt% BYK-111 displayed significantly better dispersion, especially the one with 1 wt% BYK-111, which exhibited minimal agglomeration. The microstructure of the sintered ceramics, as shown in (d)\u2013(f), further confirms the denser structure of the ceramics with 1 wt% BYK-111 compared to those with other dispersant contents. As a result of this dense structure, the printed ceramic with 1 wt% BYK-111 exhibited the lowest radial and axial shrinkage, at 16.63 % and 16.33 %, respectively, as shown in. Moreover, the density of the ceramic reached approximately 7.15 g/cmE^{3} in (h), which is 95.3 % of that of dry-pressed ceramics and is superior to the results of some other 3D-printed lead-based ceramics. The polarization-electric field (P-E) loops, strain-electric field (S-E) curves, and piezoelectric constants of the printed PZT ceramics were measured. As shown in (a), the ferroelectric hysteresis loops are symmetrical, with the remnant polarization (P r ) of the printed ceramic with 1 wt% BYK-111 reaching 32.2 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, approximately 94.15 % of that of dry-pressed ceramic. In (b), the strain of the printed ceramic under an electric field of 40 kV/cm is 0.223 %, which is only 0.011 % lower than that of dry-pressed ceramics. The printed ceramics in this study are cylindrical, with a diameter of 8.5 mm and a height of 2.5 mm. The d 33 value of the printed ceramics is approximately 445 pC/N, as shown in (c), which is superior to the results of most current studies on 3D-printed macro-sized piezoelectric ceramics. Although the d 33 value of PZT ceramics (raw material d 33 = 630 pC/N) printed by Lu et al. reached 583 pC/N , the prepared ceramics were rectangular, with dimensions of 3 mm in length, 2.6 mm in width, and 0.2 mm in height. Due to its smaller dimensions, particularly its thickness, which is only 10 % of the printed ceramics in this work, the incidence of defects is lower, resulting in a higher d 33 value. Various piezoelectric structures were designed and fabricated, including 1\u20133, 1-3-2, and 3-1 arrays for piezoelectric transducers, as well as a helical structure for use in piezoelectric actuators, as shown in (a)\u2013(d). The printed AE sensor was produced by encapsulating the 1\u20133 piezoelectric array depicted in (b), as illustrated in (e). The signal amplitudes received by both sensors, as shown in (f), were approximately the same, around 93 dB. Notably, the printed sensor exhibited a substrate noise level of 31 dB, which is lower than the 34 dB observed in the commercial sensor. This results in a signal-to-noise ratio of 62 dB for the printed sensor, compared to 59 dB for the commercial sensor. This heightened sensitivity is advantageous for AE sensors used in structural health monitoring. In contrast, the commercial sensor exhibits a significant secondary reflection wave at 0.235 ms, which can reduce signal reception accuracy. The test results for the frequency domain signal waveforms, shown in (i), indicate that the operating frequency ranges of both sensors are nearly identical, functioning properly within the 1 kHz\u2013500 kHz range.

Adjusting the surface quality of printed components via controlling dispersant content to improve the electrical performance of DLP-printed PZT ceramics and devices

# ABSTRACT
This paper aims to enhance the surface quality of digital light processing (DLP) printed lead zirconate titanate (PZT) components by controlling the content of BYK-111 dispersant, thereby improving the electrical properties of the resulting printed piezoelectric ceramics and devices. 55Â vol% high solid loading PZT slurries with different dispersant contents were prepared and assessed for their dispersion stability, rheological behavior and curing characteristics. The slurry containing 1Â wt% BYK-111 demonstrated ideal rheological properties, notably achieving a low viscosity of 1.37Â PaÂ·s at 100 sâ1. The surface roughness of the printed ceramic component was reduced to 69.3Â nm, representing a 57.1Â % improvement in surface quality compared to other dispersant levels. The printed PZT ceramic exhibited superior piezoelectric performance, with a piezoelectric constant d33
                      reaching 445Â pC/N, surpassing most existing 3D-printed macro-sized piezoelectric ceramics. Furthermore, a DLP-printed 1â3 piezoelectric array was encapsulated to fabricate an acoustic emission (AE) sensor, which achieved a low substrate noise level of 31Â dB and a high signal-to-noise ratio of 62Â dB, outperforming commercial sensors. The optimal BYK-111 content not only ensures favorable dispersion stability and rheological properties in the slurry, but also significantly enhances the surface quality and density of the printed ceramic components, ultimately leading to the production of high-performance piezoelectric ceramics and devices.

# INTRODUCTION
Among these materials, lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoelectric ceramics, known for their high piezoelectric constants and electromechanical coupling coefficients, are widely used as core components in electronic devices, including filters, sensors, and transducers. Ceramic slurry is the foundation and key element of DLP technology, primarily composed of dispersants, photosensitive resins, and ceramic particles. For instance, Sun  and Zhang et al.  developed zirconia ceramic slurries with superior dispersion stability and viscosities below 1.50 Pa\xb7s by optimizing the dispersant content, successfully printing zirconia ceramic components. Xu  and Zhang et al.  adjusted the type of dispersant so as to achieve alumina slurries with solid loadings exceeding 45 vol% and viscosities under 2.00 Pa\xb7s, resulting in ideal self-leveling behavior. Jiao et al.  used an appropriate quantity of 1 wt% KOS110 dispersant and 2 wt% PEG300 thickener to achieve both a 55 vol% high solid loading and a low viscosity of 3.04 Pa\xb7s for PZT slurry. In their study, Liu et al.  selected suitable dispersants (1 wt% KH560 and 1 wt% Darvan) to prepare a Si3N4 slurry with moderate viscosity and a curing depth of up to 50 \u03bcm, enabling the printing of dense Si3N4 ceramics (3.28 g/cm\xb3) by stereolithography (SLA). Liu et al.  employed Triton X-100 dispersant to prepare 80 wt% solid loading BaTiO3 slurry with a curing depth exceeding 45 \u03bcm, resulting in DLP-printed BaTiO3 ceramics with a piezoelectric constant d 33 of 168.1 pC/N. Liu et al.  used Solsperse 41000 dispersant to fabricate PZT slurry with a curing depth of 43 \u03bcm, leading to the production of PZT piezoelectric ceramics with exceptional electrical properties (d 33 = 365 pC/N) via vat photopolymerization (VPP). To address this issue, Kim et al.  successfully improved the printing accuracy and surface quality of ceramic components by optimizing the dispersant content, reducing the surface roughness (S a ) of the printed ceramics to approximately 1.2 \u03bcm. However, this work focused exclusively on the impact of dispersant content in ceramic slurries with lower solid loading (80 wt%), and the resulting surface roughness remained at the micrometer level. This paper presents a systematic investigation into the effect of BYK-111 dispersant content on the performance of high solid loading PZT slurries and the surface quality and electrical properties of DLP-printed ceramic components. A series of 55 vol% PZT slurries with varying BYK-111 contents were prepared. The study examines the impact of BYK-111 content on the slurry's stability and rheological behavior, elucidating the modification mechanism of the dispersant on ceramic particles. The performance of the printed PZT piezoelectric ceramics and the corresponding acoustic emission (AE) sensor was also assessed, confirming the effectiveness of the printed piezoelectric ceramics and devices.

# CONCLUSION
This work aims to enhance the performance of PZT slurries and improve the surface quality of the printed ceramic components by optimizing the BYK-111 dispersant content, ultimately advancing the electrical performance of the printed ceramics and devices. The study successfully prepared 55 vol% high solid loading PZT slurries with varying BYK-111 contents and evaluated their dispersion stability, rheological properties, and curing behavior. The PZT slurry containing 1 wt% BYK-111 exhibited the best dispersion stability, with a low viscosity of 1.37 Pa\xb7s, and demonstrated superior printing accuracy. The surface roughness of the printed ceramic components was reduced to 69.3 nm, with surface flatness improved by 57.1 % compared to components with other dispersant contents. Additionally, the printed PZT ceramic achieved a density of 7.15 g/cmE^{3} and a relative density of 95.3 %. The ceramic also displayed robust piezoelectric properties, particularly a d 33 value of 445 pC/N, surpassing most existing results for 3D-printed macro-sized piezoelectric ceramics. Furthermore, a 1\u20133 piezoelectric array was printed, and an AE sensor was fabricated by encapsulating this structure. The sensor achieved a signal amplitude of 93 dB, with a substrate noise as low as 31 dB and a high signal-to-noise ratio of 62 dB, exceeding the performance of commercial sensors, thereby indicating favorable signal accuracy.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a) and (b) illustrate the dispersion stability of PZT slurries with varying dispersant contents. As shown, the sedimentation ratio of the ceramic slurry with 1 wt% BYK-111 is higher than that of the other slurries, remaining at 93.2 % even after 14 days. The sedimentation images of the PZT slurry further confirm that the slurry with 1 wt% BYK-111 exhibits minimal sedimentation and maintains sound dispersion stability, making it favorable for DLP printing of PZT slurries. For the accurate printing of PZT ceramic components, the slurry used in DLP printing must exhibit favorable rheological properties. (c) shows the viscosity versus shear rate curves for the ceramic slurries. The viscosities of the slurries containing 0.5, 1, and 2 wt% BYK-111 display significant shear thinning behavior as the shear rate increases, which can be attributed to the rearrangement of ceramic particles in the flow direction at higher shear rates. In contrast, the slurries with 3 and 4 wt% BYK-111 demonstrate highly unstable viscosities and exhibit shear thickening. Additionally, the viscosity of the slurry at 100 s\u207bE^{1} initially decreases and then increases with rising BYK-111 content, reaching a minimum value of 1.37 Pa\xb7s at 1 wt%. Notably, the viscosities of the slurries with 3 and 4 wt% BYK-111 are 5.15 and 8.74 Pa\xb7s, respectively, which are significantly higher than the maximum viscosity of 3 Pa\xb7s required for DLP printing. This indicates that these slurries are unsuitable for DLP printing. Consequently, the subsequent discussion will focus only on the properties of the ceramic slurries with BYK-111 contents of 0.5, 1, and 2 wt%. The shear stress curve in (d) was obtained by fitting the Herschel-Bulkey function , and the fitted equation is as follows: where \u03c4 represents the slurry shear stress, \u03c4 0 is the slurry yield stress during shear, K stands for the slurry consistency index, \u03b3 is the shear rate, n indicates the rheological index. All R E^{ } values exceed 0.999, indicating that the experimental data fit the Herschel-Bulkey model extremely well. Besides, the n value of the slurry with 1 wt% BYK-111 is 1.0168, which is closer to 1 compared to other slurries. Meanwhile, the rheological properties of the slurry containing 1 wt% BYK-111 are also demonstrated to be highly satisfactory. The influence of BYK-111 content on the dispersion stability and rheological behavior of ceramic slurry is thoroughly analyzed by investigating the modification mechanism of the ceramic particles. Notably, the particles modified with 1 wt% BYK-111 exhibit the highest absolute zeta potential value at 15.2 mV. As depicted in (b), for particles modified with 1 and 2 wt% BYK-111, a broad peak in the range of 3300\u20133600 cmE^{\u22121} is observed, which is associated with O-H stretching vibrations. Hydroxyl groups are capable of attracting charges, which results in an increase in the charge carried by the particle surfaces, leading to a larger zeta potential for the ceramic particles modified with 1 wt% BYK-111. A higher zeta potential value indicates greater electrostatic repulsion among particles in the ceramic slurry , which in turn leads to reduced particle agglomeration and enhanced dispersion stability of the slurry. (c)\u2013(f) visually depict the surfaces of modified PZT particles. The adsorption layer on the particles modified with 1 wt% BYK-111 displayed uniformity and a moderate thickness. In contrast, the adsorption layer appeared thin and sparse when the BYK-111 content was below this level and became overly thick when it exceeded this amount. As shown in (g), an optimal BYK-111 content ensures full modification of the particle surface without causing cross-linking of the dispersant molecular chains. The results demonstrate that a slurry containing 1 wt% BYK-111 achieves high dispersion stability and maintains a low viscosity of 1.37 Pa\xb7s. With insufficient BYK-111 content, only a few dispersant molecules adhere to the surface of the modified particles, leading to incomplete modification. Conversely, an excessive BYK-111 content results in excessive adsorption of dispersant molecules on the particle surface, leading to cross-linking and entanglement at the ends of the molecular chains. The curing behavior of the PZT slurry is evaluated with respect to the printing accuracy of the ceramic components. The accuracy test models for PZT slurries at different exposure energies are illustrated in (a). At an exposure energy of 55 mJ/cmE^{2}, three distinct circles are clearly visible in the model using the 1 wt% BYK-111 slurry. In contrast, the smallest circle in the slurries with 0.5 and 2 wt% BYK-111 is partially or fully obscured by the over-curing layer. Interestingly, the circles remain discernible in the model with 1 wt% BYK-111 slurry across all exposure energies. Notably, at an exposure energy of 275 mJ/cmE^{2}, although the circle edges show signs of over-curing, a circle is still observable. For the slurries with 0.5 and 2 wt% BYK-111, severe over-curing occurs in the accuracy test model when exposure energies exceed 165 mJ/cmE^{2}, resulting in the circles being completely enveloped by the over-curing layer. It is considered to be caused by UV light scattering during the printing process. This phenomenon can intensify UV light scattering during printed process. The slurry containing 1 wt% BYK-111 has better dispersion stability, which improves printing accuracy at identical exposure energy. These observations indicate that the slurry with 1 wt% BYK-111 maintains high printing accuracy at comparable exposure energies. (b) depicts the variation of curing depth with exposure energy for the ceramic slurries. However, the differences in the curing depth of slurries with varying BYK-111 contents at the same exposure energy are minimal. Despite this, the printing accuracy of these slurries shows clear distinctions. (c) uses the Beer-Lambert theory  to further clarify the reasons behind these discrepancies in printing accuracy. where C d represents the curing depth (\u03bcm), D p the penetration depth (\u03bcm), E i the surface energy density (mJ/cmE^{2}), and E c denotes the critical exposure energy density (mJ/cmE^{2}). It is noteworthy that ceramic slurries with 1 wt% BYK-111 exhibit the lowest D p and E c. Lower E c values allow the slurry to cure at reduced exposure energies and minimize the scattering of UV light during the printing process. Consequently, this slurry achieves superior printing accuracy at the same exposure energy compared to slurries with 0.5 and 2 wt% BYK-111, thus providing favorable conditions for producing printed PZT ceramic components with high surface quality. The SEM images and corresponding 3D profiles of the surfaces of printed ceramic components are displayed in (a)\u2013(c). On the surface of the ceramic component with 0.5 wt% BYK-111, a substantial number of large bulges and pores are observed. At a BYK-111 content of 1 wt%, these large bulges have transformed into smaller particles, resulting in a noticeably flatter surface. However, increasing the BYK-111 content further to 2 wt% leads to increased particle agglomeration on the surface once again. The poor dispersion stability of the ceramic slurries with 0.5 and 2 wt% BYK-111 causes particle agglomeration during printing, which is evident from the large bulges shown in (a). In contrast, the high dispersion stability and rheological properties of the ceramic slurry with 1 wt% BYK-111 prevent particle agglomeration during the printing process, thus enhancing the surface quality of the printed ceramic components. As shown in (d), the ceramic component with 0.5 wt% BYK-111 exhibits the highest S a value of 161.5 nm. In contrast, the component with 1 wt% BYK-111 demonstrates the lowest S a value of 69.3 nm, representing a 57.1 % improvement in surface flatness compared to the former. Additionally, the height difference between the highest and lowest points of the measured surface, S z , and the surface peak density, S ds , as indicated in Equation , are used as spatial parameters to quantify the undulation and the number of peaks on the surface. where S ds represents the surface peak density (mmE^{\u22122}), N the number of peaks on the measured inner surface. Increasing the amount of BYK-111 initially leads to a decrease and then an increase in both S z and S ds values, with a minimum observed at 1 wt%, where the values are 2.55 \u03bcm and 8099.1 mmE^{\u22122}, respectively. This suggests that an optimized content of BYK-111 is beneficial for enhancing the surface quality of printed ceramic components. The thermogravimetric (TG) results of printed green bodies with different dispersant contents are shown in (a)\u2013(c). The TG curves show that the mass loss process during debinding can be divided into two stages (160\u2013440 \xb0C), corresponding to two exothermic peaks near 350 \xb0C and 410 \xb0C in the DTG curves. Specifically, all the samples showed the highest mass loss in stage I, and the stage I mass loss increased from 9.1 % to 9.8 % with increasing dispersant content. The mass loss in Stage II is much lower compared to Stage I, but the mass loss can still exceed 1 %, indicating that a small amount of organic matter is still decomposing in the Stage II green body. In addition, the DTG curves show that the temperature of the main pyrolysis peaks does not change much as the dispersant content increases. The degreasing stage was carried out from room temperature to 600 \xb0C at a temperature increase rate of 0.2 \xb0C/min, and was held at 360, 415 and 600 \xb0C for 2 h each to ensure complete decomposition of the organic matter. It was then heated to 1180 \xb0C at a rate of 5 \xb0C/min, held for 2 h, and allowed to cool naturally to room temperature. (a)\u2013(c) shows the cross-sectional SEM images of the printed PZT green bodies. All the printed PZT green bodies exhibited strong interlayer bonding. However, the cross-section of the green body with 0.5 wt% BYK-111 showed significant particle agglomeration, which can lead to a deterioration in the surface quality of the printed ceramics, consistent with the phenomenon illustrated in (a). The green bodies with 1 and 2 wt% BYK-111 displayed significantly better dispersion, especially the one with 1 wt% BYK-111, which exhibited minimal agglomeration. The microstructure of the sintered ceramics, as shown in (d)\u2013(f), further confirms the denser structure of the ceramics with 1 wt% BYK-111 compared to those with other dispersant contents. As a result of this dense structure, the printed ceramic with 1 wt% BYK-111 exhibited the lowest radial and axial shrinkage, at 16.63 % and 16.33 %, respectively, as shown in. Moreover, the density of the ceramic reached approximately 7.15 g/cmE^{3} in (h), which is 95.3 % of that of dry-pressed ceramics and is superior to the results of some other 3D-printed lead-based ceramics. The polarization-electric field (P-E) loops, strain-electric field (S-E) curves, and piezoelectric constants of the printed PZT ceramics were measured. As shown in (a), the ferroelectric hysteresis loops are symmetrical, with the remnant polarization (P r ) of the printed ceramic with 1 wt% BYK-111 reaching 32.2 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, approximately 94.15 % of that of dry-pressed ceramic. In (b), the strain of the printed ceramic under an electric field of 40 kV/cm is 0.223 %, which is only 0.011 % lower than that of dry-pressed ceramics. The printed ceramics in this study are cylindrical, with a diameter of 8.5 mm and a height of 2.5 mm. The d 33 value of the printed ceramics is approximately 445 pC/N, as shown in (c), which is superior to the results of most current studies on 3D-printed macro-sized piezoelectric ceramics. Although the d 33 value of PZT ceramics (raw material d 33 = 630 pC/N) printed by Lu et al. reached 583 pC/N , the prepared ceramics were rectangular, with dimensions of 3 mm in length, 2.6 mm in width, and 0.2 mm in height. Due to its smaller dimensions, particularly its thickness, which is only 10 % of the printed ceramics in this work, the incidence of defects is lower, resulting in a higher d 33 value. Various piezoelectric structures were designed and fabricated, including 1\u20133, 1-3-2, and 3-1 arrays for piezoelectric transducers, as well as a helical structure for use in piezoelectric actuators, as shown in (a)\u2013(d). The printed AE sensor was produced by encapsulating the 1\u20133 piezoelectric array depicted in (b), as illustrated in (e). The signal amplitudes received by both sensors, as shown in (f), were approximately the same, around 93 dB. Notably, the printed sensor exhibited a substrate noise level of 31 dB, which is lower than the 34 dB observed in the commercial sensor. This results in a signal-to-noise ratio of 62 dB for the printed sensor, compared to 59 dB for the commercial sensor. This heightened sensitivity is advantageous for AE sensors used in structural health monitoring. In contrast, the commercial sensor exhibits a significant secondary reflection wave at 0.235 ms, which can reduce signal reception accuracy. The test results for the frequency domain signal waveforms, shown in (i), indicate that the operating frequency ranges of both sensors are nearly identical, functioning properly within the 1 kHz\u2013500 kHz range.

Among these materials, lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoelectric ceramics, known for their high piezoelectric constants and electromechanical coupling coefficients, are widely used as core components in electronic devices, including filters, sensors, and transducers. Ceramic slurry is the foundation and key element of DLP technology, primarily composed of dispersants, photosensitive resins, and ceramic particles. For instance, Sun  and Zhang et al.  developed zirconia ceramic slurries with superior dispersion stability and viscosities below 1.50 Pa\xb7s by optimizing the dispersant content, successfully printing zirconia ceramic components. Xu  and Zhang et al.  adjusted the type of dispersant so as to achieve alumina slurries with solid loadings exceeding 45 vol% and viscosities under 2.00 Pa\xb7s, resulting in ideal self-leveling behavior. Jiao et al.  used an appropriate quantity of 1 wt% KOS110 dispersant and 2 wt% PEG300 thickener to achieve both a 55 vol% high solid loading and a low viscosity of 3.04 Pa\xb7s for PZT slurry. In their study, Liu et al.  selected suitable dispersants (1 wt% KH560 and 1 wt% Darvan) to prepare a Si3N4 slurry with moderate viscosity and a curing depth of up to 50 \u03bcm, enabling the printing of dense Si3N4 ceramics (3.28 g/cm\xb3) by stereolithography (SLA). Liu et al.  employed Triton X-100 dispersant to prepare 80 wt% solid loading BaTiO3 slurry with a curing depth exceeding 45 \u03bcm, resulting in DLP-printed BaTiO3 ceramics with a piezoelectric constant d 33 of 168.1 pC/N. Liu et al.  used Solsperse 41000 dispersant to fabricate PZT slurry with a curing depth of 43 \u03bcm, leading to the production of PZT piezoelectric ceramics with exceptional electrical properties (d 33 = 365 pC/N) via vat photopolymerization (VPP). To address this issue, Kim et al.  successfully improved the printing accuracy and surface quality of ceramic components by optimizing the dispersant content, reducing the surface roughness (S a ) of the printed ceramics to approximately 1.2 \u03bcm. However, this work focused exclusively on the impact of dispersant content in ceramic slurries with lower solid loading (80 wt%), and the resulting surface roughness remained at the micrometer level. This paper presents a systematic investigation into the effect of BYK-111 dispersant content on the performance of high solid loading PZT slurries and the surface quality and electrical properties of DLP-printed ceramic components. A series of 55 vol% PZT slurries with varying BYK-111 contents were prepared. The study examines the impact of BYK-111 content on the slurry's stability and rheological behavior, elucidating the modification mechanism of the dispersant on ceramic particles. The performance of the printed PZT piezoelectric ceramics and the corresponding acoustic emission (AE) sensor was also assessed, confirming the effectiveness of the printed piezoelectric ceramics and devices.

# CONCLUSION
This work aims to enhance the performance of PZT slurries and improve the surface quality of the printed ceramic components by optimizing the BYK-111 dispersant content, ultimately advancing the electrical performance of the printed ceramics and devices. The study successfully prepared 55 vol% high solid loading PZT slurries with varying BYK-111 contents and evaluated their dispersion stability, rheological properties, and curing behavior. The PZT slurry containing 1 wt% BYK-111 exhibited the best dispersion stability, with a low viscosity of 1.37 Pa\xb7s, and demonstrated superior printing accuracy. The surface roughness of the printed ceramic components was reduced to 69.3 nm, with surface flatness improved by 57.1 % compared to components with other dispersant contents. Additionally, the printed PZT ceramic achieved a density of 7.15 g/cmE^{3} and a relative density of 95.3 %. The ceramic also displayed robust piezoelectric properties, particularly a d 33 value of 445 pC/N, surpassing most existing results for 3D-printed macro-sized piezoelectric ceramics. Furthermore, a 1\u20133 piezoelectric array was printed, and an AE sensor was fabricated by encapsulating this structure. The sensor achieved a signal amplitude of 93 dB, with a substrate noise as low as 31 dB and a high signal-to-noise ratio of 62 dB, exceeding the performance of commercial sensors, thereby indicating favorable signal accuracy.

**Notes**:
- Write complete chemical formulas (e.g. '(Use the abbreviation key-value pair to track the abbreviations while extracting composition-property keywords). Don't use abbreviations, but you can use different environment if multiple compositions have different d33 values in different environments. For e.g.: 'LiNbO3-Air' and 'LiNbO3-Vacuum'.
- If multiple compositions are mentioned with different d33 values, extract all compositions mentioning different type/environment with a '-' and coreresponding d33 values.
- Mos of the formula are provided in ABSTRACT or INTRODUCTION or first part of EXPERIMENTAL SYNTHESIS.
- Use element symbols (e.g. 'K' not 'Potassium')
- For compositions with variables:
   * If multiple d33 values exist: Extract all compositions by substituting each variable value
   * If single d33 value: Extract only the best composition
- Prioritize data from tables
- Preserve proper chemical notation including:
   * Subscripts for atom counts
   * Parentheses for grouped elements
   * Proper fraction formatting
- Include the measurement unit for d33 values (usually pC/N or pm/V)
- Identify the broader family/class of materials - can be abbreviated forms
- Include if there is any doping in the composition using '+' sign with the composition, e.g. 'LiNbO3 + 2%wt Mg'
- Don't remove brackets or parentheses from the chemical formula which is already in the composition. Also, sometimes fractions are written before the composition (mostly in ()) for composition mixtures, don't remove them.
- Don't modify the abbreviation from referenced papers unless full composition is not available.
- ALWAYS follow the asked JSON format. DON'T write any extra information such as note points or explanations.
