*Abbreviation Note*:
- DON'T consider greek letters for abbreviation, for e.g. α should not be taken as 'Alpha'.

Also, wherever single variable is present you MUST WRAP it within a (), For e.g.- (1-x)Na2xBayTi2O3 should be (1-x)Na2(x)Ba(y)TiO3.
- Only consider the article's own work data. Don't consider referenced paper's data. Sometimes in the table compositions and corresponding property data from referenced papers are mentioned.

# TITLE
Giant piezoelectricity due to critical phenomena associated with restabilized rhombohedral phase in Pb(Mg<inf>1/3</inf>Nb<inf>2/3</inf>)O<inf>3</inf>–0.3PbTiO<inf>3</inf>

# ABSTRACT
Following our previous phenomenological modeling of pressure driven Curie transition and rhombohedral-tetragonal phase boundary in Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3–0.3PbTiO3, in this work we focus on combined effects of moderate pressure and [111]-oriented E-field and report huge broad peaks of piezoelectric d
                     33 in restabilized rhombohedral phase region stretching from around near-tricritical triple point (TP) to the regime of critical end point (CEP). TP and CEP exhibit distinctive features in the free energy landscape and pressure dependence of piezoelectric constants. We also find gigantic piezoelectricity in metastable monoclinic state coexisting with the restabilized rhombohedral state over the field level for the TP.

**Notes**:
- Write complete chemical formulas (e.g. '(Use the abbreviation key-value pair to track the abbreviations while extracting composition-property keywords). Don't use abbreviations, but you can use different environment if multiple compositions have different d33 values in different environments. For e.g.: 'LiNbO3-Air' and 'LiNbO3-Vacuum'.
- If multiple compositions are mentioned with different d33 values, extract all compositions mentioning different type/environment with a '-' and coreresponding d33 values.
- Mos of the formula are provided in ABSTRACT or INTRODUCTION or first part of EXPERIMENTAL SYNTHESIS.
- Use element symbols (e.g. 'K' not 'Potassium')
- For compositions with variables:
   * If multiple d33 values exist: Extract all compositions by substituting each variable value
   * If single d33 value: Extract only the best composition
- Prioritize data from tables
- Preserve proper chemical notation including:
   * Subscripts for atom counts
   * Parentheses for grouped elements
   * Proper fraction formatting
- Include the measurement unit for d33 values (usually pC/N or pm/V)
- Identify the broader family/class of materials - can be abbreviated forms
- Include if there is any doping in the composition using '+' sign with the composition, e.g. 'LiNbO3 + 2%wt Mg'
- Don't remove brackets or parentheses from the chemical formula which is already in the composition. Also, sometimes fractions are written before the composition (mostly in ()) for composition mixtures, don't remove them.
- Don't modify the abbreviation from referenced papers unless full composition is not available.
- ALWAYS follow the asked JSON format. DON'T write any extra information such as note points or explanations.
