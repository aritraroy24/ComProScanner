**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'solid-state reaction', 'precursors': ['Nd2O3', 'Bi2O3', 'Sc2O3', 'PbO', 'TiO2'], 'steps': ['Weigh the high-purity oxides according to the stoichiometric ratio.', 'Ball-mill the powders in an ethanol medium with zirconia balls for 24 h.', 'Dry the mixture in the oven.', 'Calcine the mixture at 850 °C for 3 h.', 'Ball mill the calcined powder in ethanol for an additional 12 h.', 'Dry and granulate the mixture by adding 5 wt% polyvinyl alcohol.', 'Sieve the mixture through an 80-mesh screen to obtain uniform powder particles.', 'Uniaxially dry press the powder mixtures into samples with a diameter of 10 mm and a thickness of 1.5 mm.', 'Sinter the samples at a rate of 3 °C/min, reaching temperatures between 1120 and 1200 °C for 2 h in ambient air after removing the binder at 550 °C.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'SEM', 'quasi-static d33 meter', 'ferroelectric analyzer', 'LCR meter']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
