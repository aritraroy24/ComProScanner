Na0.25K0.25Bi2.5+x Nb2O9+3x/2 (\u2212100xBi-NKBN) (x = 0, \u22120.01, \u22120.03, \u22120.05, \u22120.07, \u22120.10) lead-free piezoelectric ceramics were synthesized by solid-state reaction method. The simplified names are NKBN, 1Bi-NKBN, 3Bi-NKBN, 5Bi-NKBN, 7Bi-NKBN, and 10Bi-NKBN, respectively. The raw materials were first prepared according to the calculated ratios and then put in the planetary ball mill for 4 hours. After drying the slurry at 100 \u2103 and calcined at 850 \u2103 for 2 hours. After drying the slurry using the same method, the 7 wt.% of binder (polyvinyl alcohol) was added and then the powder was well grounded. Finally, the powder was pressed into 10 mm diameter discs and calcined at 1100 \xb0C for 2 hours. The crystal structure of the \u2212100xBi-NKBN samples was characterized by an X-ray diffractometer (Smartlab SE, Rigaku, Japan), and the XRD data were refined using Jana 2006 software.

The variation of \u03b5r and tan\u03b4 with temperature was tested using an LCR analyzer (Model E4990, Keysight, USA). The polarized samples were left for 24 hours, and then a quasi-static d 33 meter (ZJ-3A, China Model ZJ-3; IACAS, Shanghai, China) measurements of d 33 were used.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
XRD refinement allows better analysis of ceramic sample crystal structure changes. shows \u2212100xBi-NKBN sample structure refinement by using Jana 2006 software with the A21 am space group. The main phases of all samples matched the diffraction peaks of JCPDS No. 97\u2013018\u20136933, indicating that the \u2212100xBi-NKBN ceramics were successfully synthesized in the Bi deficiency. lists the crystal data and lattice parameter of \u2212100xBi-NKBN ceramics. The ratio of a/b in the orthorhombic crystal system indicates the degree of structural distortion, and the closer the ratio is to 1, the smaller the degree of structural distortion. The ratios of a/b for Bi deficiency samples are all greater than NKBN, suggesting that increasing Bi deficiency leads to an increase in structural distortion. The lattice parameters a, b, c, and unit cell volume V value of \u2212100xBi-NKBN are shown in. Noguchi et al. found that the perovskite layers are more prone to produce Bi vacancies than (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layers by calculating E vacancy, suggesting that the Bi deficiency originates mainly from the perovskite layers. In addition, there is compressive stress between the perovskite layer and the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layer due to the mismatch of cell parameters of the two layers. The natural surface electron microscopy images of the \u2212100xBi-NKBN ceramic samples as shown in (a)-(f). Due to the low surface free energy in the a-b plane, the growth rate in this plane is faster than in other planes, resulting in all ceramic samples exhibiting a plate-like morphology typical of BLSFs. With the increasing Bi deficiency, the grain size and grain thickness also decrease gradually, which may be due to the reduced liquid medium of molten Bi2O3 in the Bi deficiency, which hinders the migration and diffusion of the reactants. The high sintering temperature of the ceramic samples resulted in the volatilization of Bi2O3. To verify whether the Bi deficiency of NKBN can mitigate the volatilization of Bi2O3, XPS measurements of NKBN and 5Bi-NKBN were performed to estimate the oxygen vacancy concentration. (a)-(b) are the XPS spectra of NKBN and 5Bi-NKBN, respectively. It was found that the XPS spectra of NKBN and 5Bi-NKBN show peak splitting and were fitted with peak splitting using Advantage software. The peak with a binding energy of 531.1 eV is the oxygen-deficient region V o \u2033, while the peak at 530.5 eV is the lattice oxygenV o x. In general, the oxygen vacancy concentration is the ratio of the area of V o \u2033 to the area of V o x in the sample. The oxygen vacancy concentration was calculated to be 0.30 for NKBN and 0.25 for 5Bi-NKBN. Oxygen vacancy concentration was significantly reduced, suggesting that the volatilization of Bi2O3 in NKBN can be alleviated by the Bi deficiency. DC resistivity is the main means of characterizing the insulating properties of piezoelectric ceramics. (a) shows DC resistivity of \u2212100xBi-NKBN. The DC resistivity decreases significantly with increasing temperature, it is clear that the DC resistivity is negatively correlated with the temperature. In addition, it can be found that the resistivity is close to 10E^{6} \u03a9\xb7cm at 600 \u2103. This may be due to reduced oxygen vacancies and holes due to the mitigated volatilization of Bi2O3 in the Bi deficiency. (b) shows the carrier activation energy (E a) of \u2212100xBi-NKBN ceramics calculated according to the Arrhenius equation. The E a of \u2212100xBi-NKBN was slightly lower compared to the E a of NKBN, which may be attributed to the decrease in grain size due to Bi deficiency, defect carriers and impurity ions are more likely to accumulate at grain boundaries. It can be found that the E a increases from 1.23 eV to 1.42 eV with the increasing Bi deficiency. This may be due to an increase in Bi deficiency resulting in increased barrier energy for the transport of charged carriers. (a) shows the \u03b5r and tan\u03b4 of \u2212100xBi-NKBN at 1 MHz. It can be found that the T c slightly decreases with the increase of Bi deficiency, and the T c of \u2212100xBi-NKBN is higher than 650 \u2103. (b) shows the variation of T c and tan\u03b4 at 600 \u2103 of \u2212100xBi-NKBN. The T c of 5Bi-NKBN and 7Bi-NKBN is the lowest, and the lowest T c is 651 \u2103, which indicates that the ceramic samples can still maintain high T c under the Bi deficiency. In addition, dielectric loss tan\u03b4 represents a significant parameter in practical applications. It can be found that the tan\u03b4 rises sharply above 500 \u2103, but even at 600 \u2103 the tan\u03b4 of Bi deficiency samples is as low as 0.08, while the tan\u03b4 of NKBN is 0.32. This may be attributed to a reduction in the concentration of oxygen vacancies and further verifies that the volatilization of Bi2O3 in NKBN can be mitigated by the Bi deficiency. (a) shows the radar diagram of NKBN and 5Bi-NKBN, which is mainly considered from five aspects, including T c, d 33, \u03c1 @600 \u2103, tan\u03b4 @600 \u2103, and oxygen vacancy concentration. The results show that the d 33 and DC resistivity are improved, tan\u03b4 and oxygen vacancy concentration are decreased while maintaining a higher T c in 5Bi-NKBN. Although the T c of 5Bi-NKBN has decreased, it remains at 651 \u2103. To study the thermal stability of NKBN in the Bi deficiency, all samples were annealed. (b) shows the variation of d 33 of \u2212100Bix-NKBN with annealing temperature. The results showed that the d 33 of all ceramics samples decreased rapidly exceeding 600 \u2103. Notably, the d 33 of 5Bi-NKBN only slightly decreases when the annealing temperature reaches 600 \xb0C, which keeps 97 % of the initial value of the d 33. In contrast, the d 33 of NKBN at 600 \u2103 is only 67 % of the initial value. It indicates that the thermal stability of NKBN has been greatly improved by the Bi deficiency, which lays a good foundation for the application of NKBN.
