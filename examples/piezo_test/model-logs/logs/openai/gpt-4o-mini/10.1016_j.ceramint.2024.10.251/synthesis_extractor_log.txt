BZT (BaZrxTi1-xO3, BZT) powder was prepared where x = 0.05  using the mixed oxide method  by calcining barium carbonate (purity \u226599.0 %, Sigma-Aldrich, Italy), zirconium dioxide (purity = 99.0 %, Riedel de Ha\xebn, France) and titanium dioxide (purity \u226599.0 %, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) at 1200 \xb0C for 2 h. Then, BZT powder was pressed into a disc shape of \u223c15 mm diameter and a thickness of \u223c1.5 mm. The applied pressure for BZT discs fabrication is \u223c85 MPa. Thereafter, BZT discs were sintered at 1450 \xb0C for 2 h. BZT composition of 40, 50, and 60 vol% BZT were used (BZT40, BZT50, and BZT60) and epoxy resin (ER) was added at 0, 3, 5, and 7 vol% with the cement paste. First, BZT discs (dimension \u223c12 mm and thickness \u223c1.5 mm) were poled using an electric field of 1.5 kV/mm at 50 \xb0C for 30 min in a silicone oil chamber. By using a cut and fill method, poled BZT ceramic was cut using a diamond saw in a parallel direction along with the polarization axis. The designed schematic diagram of 1\u20133 BZT cement-based composites is shown in. Mixtures of Portland cement powder (ASTM Type I), water, epoxy resin and hardener were used as the matrix phase in the composite. The water to cement ratio (w/c) used is 0.35 and the volume ratio of epoxy resin and hardener is 7.5. The mixture was filled into the cut areas of the BZT ceramic. The samples were then cured in a controlled chamber at 60 \xb0C for 5 days at 98 %RH. Acoustic impedance (Zc) was calculated by multiplying the density (\u03c1c) and acoustic velocity (vc) of the composites. The vc was measured using an ultrasonic thickness meter (TM-8812C). An optical microscope and a scanning electron microscope (SEM-5910LV) was used to investigate the microstructure and interface, and energy dispersive X-ray from the equipped SEM was used to detect elements of the composites. The \u03b533 at frequency of 1 kHz of the composites can be calculated from the measured capacitance (C) and tan\u03b4 values using a LCR meter (TH2819A, Tounghui) from equation as shown: where t represents the thickness of the sample (m), \u03b50 (8.854 pF/m), is the relative permittivity in free space and A is the electrode area of the sample (mE^{2}). The d33 meter (S5865, KCF technologies) was used to obtain the piezoelectric charge coefficient (d33). The piezoelectric voltage coefficient (g33) was calculated using equation as follows:

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The acoustic impedance of 1\u20133 BZT-cement composites using BZT content from 40 to 60 % and epoxy resin from 0 to 7% is shown in. A higher Zc value of the composites can be observed in composites with higher BZT volume. This is because the Zc value of BZT (25.7 \xd7 10E^{6} kg/m\xb7sE^{2}) is higher than other phases in the composite (Zc of hydrated cement \u223c5.3 \xd7 10E^{6} kg/m\xb7sE^{2} , Zc of epoxy resin = 2.99 \xd7 10E^{6} kg/m\xb7sE^{2}). The effect of epoxy resin on the acoustic impedance of 1\u20133 BZT -cement composites show that Zc value can be seen to be lower when epoxy resin content was increased for all BZT composites. For example, the composites with 40 vol% BZT and epoxy resin content up to 7 %, although reduces from \u223c10.7 \xd7 10E^{6} kg/m\xb7sE^{2} to \u223c9.4 \xd7 10E^{6} kg/m\xb7sE^{2}, the acoustic impedance still matches with that of concrete (Zc \u223c 9 \xd7 10E^{6} kg/m\xb7sE^{2} to 11.26 \xd7 10E^{6} kg/m\xb7sE^{2} ). For 50 vol% BZT composites with no epoxy resin, Zc value (\u223c11.7 \xd7 10E^{6} kg/m\xb7sE^{2}) is marginally higher than the acoustic impedance upper limit of concrete. However, the composites with 3 vol% to 7 vol% epoxy resins are found to be within the acoustic range. For 60 vol% BZT composites, 0\u20135% vol% epoxy resin are found to be outside the range but with 7 vol% epoxy resin in the composite, Zc value is in a range of acoustic impedance of concrete. Therefore, the benefit is seen when increasing epoxy resin content in the composites with 50 vol% and 60 vol% BZT where the use of epoxy resin would lead to a decrease in acoustic impedance so that the acoustic impedance becomes closer to the acoustic impedance of concrete when higher than 40 % BZT volume is used. Microstructure investigation was carried out using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) images and energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDX) on the matrix in the composites are shown in. (a) shows the microstructure of Portland cement paste with no epoxy resin where calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) can be seen. Ca, Si, C, Al, and O elements were detected as the main elements of hydration products from cement by the EDX spectrum. (b) shows the SEM micrograph of cement and epoxy resin matrix where the EDX spectrum (point 1) identifies the epoxy resin, where detected elements are nitrogen and carbon. In spectrum 2, elements detected are Ca, Si, C, Al, O and N elements, which illustrates the combination phases between the epoxy resin and hydration products of hydrated cement. Moreover, the interfaces of the composites are shown in using an optical microscope and using SEM. The optical microscopy clearly shows good binding in a larger scale dimension for all composites with epoxy resin (3%\u20137%) and without epoxy resin (0 %). For SEM, the images of the 1\u20133 BZT cement-based composite for both composites with 0 vol% and 7 vol% epoxy resins, the BZT ceramic can be seen to be continuously connected in one dimension. The interfacial zone can also be clearly observed between cement matrix paste (dark area) and BZT phase (bright area). For comparison, EDX spectrum from the cement matrix phase of the composite with epoxy resin shows nitrogen element while in sample without epoxy resin, nitrogen element was not detected, thus corresponds to the EDX spectrum of PC paste with w/c = 0.35. shows the porosity measurement results of the composites. The porosity can be seen to be highest in the composites with BZT vol. content of 40 % where the porosity values are in the range of 8.5\u20139%. This is higher than the porosity range of 7\u20138% for 60 % BZT composites. This is because of the higher cement/epoxy matrix content which is more porous than the BZT ceramic. Moreover, the effect of epoxy resin can also be seen, where it is found that for all BZT composites, the porosity is shown to reduce with increasing epoxy resin. In the 1\u20133 connectivity composite, it is believed that the use of epoxy resin was found to fill the pores of the cement matrix thus lead to a lower porosity value. show the dielectric constant and dielectric loss respectively. The \u03b533 value can be seen to increase but tan\u03b4 value is seen to decrease with increasing BZT content at the same epoxy resin content. At 7 vol% epoxy resin, the \u03b533 value of composites with BZT content from 40 vol% to 60 vol% increased from 464.79 to 636.04, showing an increase of 37 %. While the tan\u03b4 value decreased from 0.07 to 0.04 and the tan\u03b4 value was lowest for composites with 60 vol % BZT/7 vol% epoxy resin. Moreover, for all BZT content in the composites, the \u03b533 and tan\u03b4 values can be seen to decrease with increasing epoxy resin content. At 50 vol% BZT content, the \u03b533 value of composites with epoxy resin vol. Content from 0 to 7 % decreased from 622.16 to 521.10 and tan\u03b4 decreased from 0.08 to 0.05. This is because the dielectric constant of BZT (\u03b5r = 1563) is higher than hydrated cement (\u03b5r = 100) and epoxy resin (\u03b5r = 6). The much lower tan\u03b4 = 0.03  of epoxy resin in which using epoxy resin replacing the cement phase lead to a direct decrease in the overall dielectric loss of the composite since cement is a porous inorganic material and has many weak conducting ions. shows the effect of epoxy resin content on the d33 value of 1\u20133 BZT-cement composites. As the BZT content increases, the d33 value of composite showed a corresponding increase, primarily due to the higher amount of the piezoelectric phase within the composite. Specifically, when epoxy resin content was 7 vol%, the d33 value demonstrated a notable increase from 76.2 pC/N to 93 pC/N as the BZT content rose from 40 vol% to 60 vol%. Furthermore, the highest d33 value (93 pC/N), was observed when the composite consisted of 60 % BZT and 7 vol% epoxy resin, while d33 of pure BZT is 235 pC/N. In the composite with varying BZT content, the d33 value increased as the epoxy resin content was increased, as shown in. For instance, at 50 vol% BZT, the mean d33 values increased from 79 pC/N to 83 pC/N ( ) as the epoxy resin vol. Increased from 0 % to 7 %. This finding agrees with the results reported by Xu et al.  on the 1\u20133 PZT cement-polymer composites. It is noted that the d33 values of 1\u20133 BZT cement composites with epoxy resin is noticeably higher and the trend observed is different to that of 0\u20133 BZT cement composites with epoxy resin , where the d33 value of 0-3 connectivity composites decreased with increasing epoxy resin content. The ceramic sample of the 1\u20133 piezoelectric cement-based composite is poled prior to the fabrication (Poling sample is pure BZT ceramic). The use of epoxy resin in the composite reduces the presence of pores within cement and at the interface between cement and BZT, which likely to improve transmitting force to the BZT phase, when apply oscillating force during the d33 measurement and results in improve d33 value. This is due to that porosity of the 1\u20133 composites decreased with increasing epoxy resin content as shown in. While for the 0\u20133 composite, the poling of sample is slightly more difficult with epoxy addition in the 0\u20133 composite as the whole composite was poled together. The d33 values decreased when increasing epoxy resin due to that the epoxy resin acts as an insulator phase that may block or surround the piezoelectric particles as it was added in its resin form, which may result in a more resistivity electric field flow to BZT particles and unsaturated polarization. The effect of varying epoxy resin content on g33 value of 1\u20133 BZT-cement-based composite is shown in. An increase in BZT content led to a decrease in the g33 value. At 7 vol% epoxy resin, g33 value decreased from 18.5 \xd7 10E^{\u22123} V m/N to 16.5 \xd7 10E^{\u22123} V m/N when the BZT content ranged from 40 vol% to 60 vol%. This decrease is primarily attributed to the fact that the increase in the \u03b533 value of the 1\u20133 composite is more than the increase in the d33 value. For example, at 7 vol% epoxy resin, the increasing rate \u03b533 was 37 % when varying BZT from 40 to 60 vol%, while the increasing rate of d33 value was less at 22 %. Even though, d33 value of the composite with 40 vol% BZT and 5 vol% epoxy resin (75 pC/N) is lower than that of BZT ceramic (240 pC/N), the g33 value of the composite (17.0 \xd7 10E^{\u22123} V m/N) is equal to BZT ceramic (17.0 \xd7 10E^{\u22123} V m/N). The result indicates that an increase in epoxy resin content leads to a rise in the g33 value for all composites using 40 % BZT to 60 % BZT. At 50 vol% BZT, the g33 value of the composite with epoxy resin ranging from 0 vol% to 7 vol%, increased from 14.4 \xd7 10E^{\u22123} V m/N to 18.1 \xd7 10E^{\u22123} V m/N. This result aligns with the results reported by Xu et al.  for 1\u20133 PZT cement-polymer composite.

- For synthesis_methods, use the short name of the method if possible, else write the full name and don't use method/reaction word at the end.
- For precursors, just use the chemical composition (if available) else chemical name (no company or purity)
- For characterization_techniques, try using short name of the characterization techniques like XRD, Raman Spectroscopy, SEM, TEM etc. if possible, else write the full name.
