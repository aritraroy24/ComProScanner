**Description**: Format the extracted material composition and properties data. Focus on the 'Notes' if anything is provided. You MUST use 'MaterialParserTool' as tool if there is any variable in the composition in {'composition_extracted_data': {'compositions_property_values': {'Pb0.65Ba0.35Nb2O6': 236, 'Pb0.62Ba0.35Nd0.02Nb2O6': 178, 'Pb0.59Ba0.35Nd0.04Nb2O6': 178, 'Pb0.56Ba0.35Nd0.06Nb2O6': 178}, 'abbreviations': {'PBN': 'Pb(Nb, Zr)O3', 'Nd': 'Nd3+'}, 'property_unit': 'pC/N', 'family': 'PBN'}}. You MUST use the final output from the material parser tool as the final answer for such cases. Just resolve the variables - but don't do any final numerical calculation to get the composition percentage by yourself and keep the formula same as the original.
- If any abbreviated form of composition is present rewrite with the actual composition. But DON'T modify the chemical composition / periodic element with chemical name / element name for e.g., Bi should not be replaced with Bismuth or BaTiO3 should not be replaced with Barium titanate.
- If composition has variables with equation, after resolving the variable the formula should be written in a form of BODMAS rule with only () as brackets, + as addition, - as subtraction, * as multiplication and / as division. For e.g, ABx-2y/5C3 is a chemical formula, where A, B, C are periodic elements and x and y are variables with values x=2, y=3, the final chemical formula should be written as AB(2-((2*3)/5))O3 so that BODMAS rule can be applied later.

**Parameters**:
- Extracted composition-property dictionary-
{'composition_extracted_data': {'compositions_property_values': {'Pb0.65Ba0.35Nb2O6': 236, 'Pb0.62Ba0.35Nd0.02Nb2O6': 178, 'Pb0.59Ba0.35Nd0.04Nb2O6': 178, 'Pb0.56Ba0.35Nd0.06Nb2O6': 178}, 'abbreviations': {'PBN': 'Pb(Nb, Zr)O3', 'Nd': 'Nd3+'}, 'property_unit': 'pC/N', 'family': 'PBN'}}

The extracted output should look like the following-

{
  "compositions":

    "Ba0.99Ca0.01Ti0.68Zr0.32O3": 375,

", agent="Material Composition and Property Formatter", status="completed", output="Thought: The Material Formula Parser did not return the expected resolved compositions. I will manually check the compositions for any variable substitutions and ensure that the abbreviations are expanded correctly. I will also check for duplicates.

1. The compositions are:
   - Pb0.65Ba0.35Nb2O6
   - Pb0.62Ba0.35Nd0.02Nb2O6
   - Pb0.59Ba0.35Nd0.04Nb2O6
   - Pb0.56Ba0.35Nd0.06Nb2O6

2. The abbreviations are:
   - PBN: Pb(Nb, Zr)O3
   - Nd: Nd3+

3. There are no duplicates in the compositions.

Now, I will rewrite the compositions with the expanded abbreviations:
- Pb0.65Ba0.35Nb2O6 remains as is.
- Pb0.62Ba0.35Nd0.02Nb2O6 becomes Pb0.62Ba0.35Nd3+0.02Nb2O6.
- Pb0.59Ba0.35Nd0.04Nb2O6 becomes Pb0.59Ba0.35Nd3+0.04Nb2O6.
- Pb0.56Ba0.35Nd0.06Nb2O6 becomes Pb0.56Ba0.35Nd3+0.06Nb2O6.

The final formatted data will be:
