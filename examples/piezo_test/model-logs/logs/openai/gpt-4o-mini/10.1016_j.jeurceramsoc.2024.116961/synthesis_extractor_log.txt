Na0.25K0.25Bi2.5Nb2O9 (NKBN) and Na0.25K0.25Bi2.5-x Ce x Nb2-yW y O9 (NKBC x NW y , x = 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04; y = 0.02) ceramics were obtained by a solid-state reaction method. Na2CO3(99.8 %), K2CO3(99.0 %), Bi2O3(99.0 %), CeO2(99.99 %), Nb2O5(99.50 %), WO3(99.80 %) were used as the raw materials. In solid state reaction method, the highest d 33 of perovskite-like layered structure La2Ti2O7 ceramics is increased to 3.9\xb10.1 pC/N by doping of cerium. The improved d 33 could be attributable to the enhanced domain wall movement. The highest d 33 of 28 pC/N is obtained in Bi4Ti3O12-based ceramics by 0.75 % wt of CeO2 doping. The formulated powders were blended in ethanol for 4 h using the planetary ball milling method. Then calcination was implemented for 2 h at 850 \u2103 of the dried slurries. After secondary ball milling, the dried slurries were compressed into wafers (10 mm diameter) utilising 7 wt.% binder (polyvinyl alcohol). Finally, the wafers were heated at 750 \u2103 for 1 h to take out the polyvinyl alcohol and then sintering at 1100 \u2103 for 2 h. The phase structure and microscopic appearances of the NKBN-based ceramics were determined using an X-ray diffractometer (Smartlab SE, Rigaku, Japan) and a scanning electron microscope (EM-30AXP, COXEM, Korea), respectively. The atomic lattice vibration characteristics of the NKBN-based ceramics were measured by a Raman spectrometer (LabRAM HR Evolution, HORIBA JobinYvon, France). A piezoelectric force microscope observed the domain structures of the NKBN-based ceramics (Asylum research MFP-3D, OXFORD, UK). To characterise the overall electrical performance of NKBN-based ceramics, the two surfaces of the sample are coated with round silver electrodes. Information on dielectric properties and impedance spectra was obtained using an LCR analyser (Model E4990, Keysight, USA). Samples were polarised at 180 \u2103 in an electric field of 12 kV/mm for 20 minutes. After DC electric polarisation and left for 24 hours, the d 33 was achieved using a quasi-static d 33 meter (ZJ-3A, China Model ZJ-3; IACAS, Shanghai, China).

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The XRD patterns of NKBN and NKBC x NW0.02 ceramics are exhibited in (a). The diffraction peaks of all samples are consistent with the standard diffraction spectra (PDF#97\u2013018\u20136933) and exhibit an A21 am orthorhombic structure. The maximum diffraction intensity of NKBN-based ceramics belongs to (115), which follows the (112 m +1) highest diffraction peak of BLSFs. The XRD measurements showed that the doped Ce/W are diffused into the NKBN lattice without secondary phases, and Ce and W entered into the A-site and B-site of NKBN ceramics according to substitutions of ionic radii similarities, respectively. In addition, (b) shows the (115) diffraction maximum shifts vaguely towards a higher angle with increasing Ce addition, indicating that introducing Ce/W ions leads to unit cell shrinkage. This is because the radius of CeE^{3+}/CeE^{4+} ions (CeE^{3+}: 1.143 \xc5, CeE^{4+}: 0.97 \xc5) is smaller than that of BiE^{3+} ions (BiE^{3+}: 1.17 \xc5), and the radius of WE^{6+} ions (WE^{6+}: 0.60 \xc5) is smaller than that of NbE^{5+} ions (NbE^{5+}: 0.64 \xc5). The result is comparable with the previous reports. (a)-(e) shows the natural surface SEM images of the NKBN and NKBC x NW0.02 ceramics. It can be seen that the grains of the NKBN and NKBC x NW0.02 ceramics exhibit a lamellar structure. This is because the surface free energy of BLSF materials was low in the a-b plane, leading to a faster growth rate in this plane than that along other planes. The relative density of all samples is more than 94 %, as shown in (f), indicating that it is suitable to select 1100 \u2103 as the sintering temperature. In addition, the volatilisation of bismuth slows down the kinetics of the diffusion mechanisms, and then grain growth in NKBN-based ceramics will decrease. The grain size of NKBN-based ceramics increases with less bismuth volatilisation and oxygen vacancy. Raman spectrum is a forceful tool for studying the complex structure of ceramics, which can support characteristics of the atom lattice vibrations and the position occupied by the doped ions in the lattice. (a) shows the Raman spectra of NKBN and NKBC x NW0.02 ceramics, and the spectrum could be roughly divided into three regions. There are apparent phonon modes in 62, 83, 112, 178, 216, 267, 432, 561, and 839 cmE^{\u22121}. Due to the vibration of A-site atoms, Raman peaks at 83, 112, 178, and 216 cmE^{\u22121}, in the range of 50 cmE^{\u22121} to 250 cmE^{\u22121}. These frequencies of NKBC x NW0.02 ceramic are shifted slightly toward higher frequencies due to the lower mass of Ce (140.12 g/mol) compared to Bi (208.98 g/mol). The Raman spectra of all samples in the range of 250 cmE^{\u22121}\u223c950 cmE^{\u22121} were decomposed into 8 relatively independent Gauss and Lorentz components labelled as v6\u223cv13 by peak fitting, as shown in (b). The v8 and v9 modes combined with the distortion of the NbO6 octahedron decrease with W substitution. In addition, the v10 and v11 modes get weaker while the v13 mode at 835 cmE^{\u22121} gets stronger with increasing Ce concentration, suggesting that the stretching of the Nb-O bond is also changed. Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) could provide helpful information on ferroelectric domain structure and polarisation orientation. PFM amplitude and phase of NKBN and NKBC0.02NW0.02 ceramics are shown in (a) and (b), respectively. The domain structure of the NKBN sample is irregularly shaped and micrometre-sized (mainly greater than 2 \u03bcm). The domain structure of NKBC0.02NW0.02 ceramics changes compared to the NKBN sample. In the case of NKBC0.02NW0.02 ceramics, the proportion of micrometre-sized domains reduces, and the smaller island-shaped domains are present. Considering the inverse relationship between piezoelectric response and domain size, it can be reasonably inferred that small domain sizes and large domain wall density of NKBC0.02NW0.02 samples will conducive to domain switching, and the easy domain switching is propitious to improving of piezoelectric performance. is the varied temperature \u03b5r and tan\u03b4 of the NKBN and NKBC x NW0.02 ceramics at 1 MHz. The \u03b5r of all samples is about 220 at room temperature. A notable decrease of the \u03b5r near the T c is observed. The variety of \u03b5r may be due to the changes in grain size. The T c of all the components is above 650 \u2103 as given in (a), indicating that the Ce/W modified NKBN ceramic maintains a high curie temperature T c. In addition, the dielectric peak broadening of NKBC x NW0.02 ceramics is observed, which may be related to the fluctuations and disorder produced by Ce doping. (b) is the varied temperature tan\u03b4 of NKBN and NKBC x NW0.02 ceramics. The tan\u03b4 of all samples keeps the relative stabilisation within a wide temperature range of 25\u2013500 \xb0C, and the tan\u03b4 of NKBC x NW0.02 ceramics is below 0.06 even at 500 \xb0C. The higher T c and smaller tan\u03b4 of NKBC x NW0.02 ceramics provided a solid foundation for high-temperature applications. (a)-(e) shows the complex impedance spectra of the NKBN and NKBC x NW0.02 ceramics between 450 \xb0C and 550 \xb0C at 50 \xb0C intervals. The relationship between the real and imaginary parts of the impedance curve is an arc between 100 Hz and 10E^{6} Hz. The single R-CPE circuit fitting well suggests that the dominant conduction behaviour may be of grain. The cause of the decrease in resistance may be that Ce replaces BiE^{3+} in the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layer and changes its environment. But, the dc resistivity of NKBC x NW0.02 ceramics still maintains at about 10E^{6} \u03a9\xb7cm orders of magnitude with temperature as high as 500 \xb0C as shown in (f), which lays a favourable cornerstone for reliable application. Only one peak of each component can be observed in the -Z'' against frequency over the temperature range from 450 \u2103 to 550 \u2103 as shown in (a)-(e), which confirms the rationality of the parallel R-CPE circuit model developed in the previous paper The peak value of the characteristic peak decreases, and the peak shifts to a higher frequency with an increase in temperature. The activation energy of relaxation E rel of the NKBN and NKBC x NW0.02 ceramics is 1.23\u20131.43 eV, calculated by the Arrhenius relationship, as presented in (f). The creation of oxygen vacancies because of bismuth vaporization during sintering and it can be expressed as 2Bi Bi \xd7+ 3O O \xd7= 2V Bi \u2032\u2032\u2032+ 3V O \u2219\u2219+Bi 2 O 3 gas. Piezoelectric coefficient d 33 of the Ce/W co-doped NKBN ceramics is improved obviously, and the d 33 reaches above 24 pC/N when the Ce content is greater than or equal to 0.02, as shown in (a). The enhanced d 33 may be related to the delicate ferroelectric domain structures, which agrees with the previous analysis. The good piezoelectric thermal stability of BLSFs piezoceramics also counts for many practical applications. (b) represents the variation of the d 33 of NKBN and NKBC x NW0.02 ceramics with annealing temperature at 25\u2013750 \xb0C. The d 33 of the NKBN ceramics was decreased to 11.7 pC/N (only 70 % of its initial value) when the temperature rose to 500 \xb0C, while the d 33 of the NKBC0.02NW0.02 ceramic kept 20.5 pC/N (83 % of its beginning value) at the same treatment condition.
