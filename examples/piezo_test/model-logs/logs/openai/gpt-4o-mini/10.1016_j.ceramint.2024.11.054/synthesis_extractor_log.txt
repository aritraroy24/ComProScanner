This experiment used the traditional solid-state reaction method to prepare (1-x)Bi0.997La0.003FeO3-xBaTiO3 (BLF-xBT, 0.28 \u2264 x \u2264 0.32) ceramics. The raw materials of Bi2O3 (>99 %), Fe2O3 (>98 %), BaCO3 (>99 %), TiO2 (>99 %), and La2O3 (>99.99 %) were weighed according to stoichiometric ratios and mixed well in absolute ethyl allcohol for 24 h with ZrO2 balls. The slurry was then dried in an oven at 95 \xb0C, and calcined at 800 \xb0C for 4 h. Add 5 wt % PVA to the dry powder, and use 18 Mpa pressure to press into wafers with 1 mm in thickness and 12 mm in diameter. After removing PVA at 600 \xb0C for 120 min, it was sintered at 990 \xb0C\u20131000 \xb0C for 3h. Finally, it was polished with 800 mesh sandpaper and then silver paste was used to prepare samples at 600 \xb0C for 20 min. The ceramic samples with electrodes are polarized for 30 min under a direct current electric field of 4\u20135 kV/mm at 85 \xb0C. The quenching procedure is to anneal the BLF-0.3BT, BLF-0.31BT, and BLF-0.32BT sample at 970 \xb0C for 30 min and then quench in air. The quenching samples abbreviated as x = 0.3Q, 0.31Q, 0.32Q. The phase structure was characterized using an X-ray diffractometer (D8 Advance A25), surface morphology was obtained using a scanning electron microscope (JDSM-6700F), and the dielectric constant (\u03b5 r), dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) and electromechanical coupling factor (k p) and temperature-dependent k p at different temperatures were measured using a precision impedance analyzer (Agilent 4294A). Raman spectroscopy was performed using a high-resolution micro-Raman spectroscopy instrument (LavRAMHR800, Raman). Using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, EscaLab 250xix) to detect the valence state of Fe ions on the surface of ceramics. Subsequently, the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 was measured using a quasi-static d 33 testing device (ZJ-3A). The ferroelectric hysteresis loop was characterized using a ferroelectric testing equipment (TF Analyser 2000). The poled ceramics were annealed in the temperature range of 25\u2013500 \xb0C for 30 min, the d 33 of the annealed samples was measured at room temperature.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a) presents the XRD patterns for the BLF-xBT. Additionally, the XRD pattern of pure BF-0.3BT is provided as reference composition. It can be seen that each diffraction peak belong to pure perovskite structure, indicating that the crystal structure remians unchange with various BT content. As illustrated in (b), the (110) diffraction peak of each sample exhibits an asymmetric single peak. Combined with the double peak feature for (111) diffraction of (c), the phase structure of all the samples is located within the MPB region and displays two phases coexistence. With respect to the (110) and (111) peaks of the BLF-xBT, the splitting of the (110) peak becomes weaken, as x decreases, the (111) double peaks gradually merge into a single one. This indicates that phase ratio could be continually modified by adjusting BT content. For reference composition of BF-0.3BT, the phase ratio of R to T phases is determined to be 53.9/46.1 based on XRD refinement results ( (a) and ). After the introduction of LaE^{3+}, this ratio shifts from 53.9/46.1 to 45.6/54.4 at x = 0.3, indicating that LaE^{3+} doping shifts the phase boundary towards the T phase, deviating from the R/T phase ratio of 1/1 ((b)). By reducing the BT content, the two-phase ratio returns to 52.9/47.1 at x = 0.295, where the XRD characteristic peaks closely resemble those of BF-0.3BT ((c)). This demonstrates that the phase ratio can be optimized by adjusting the BT composition, achieving an almost ideal phase ratio of 1/1 at x = 0.295, consistent with the original BF-0.3BT composition. The surface SEM graphs of BLF-xBT and BF-0.3BT are given in. As the BT content increases, the grain size reduces from 7.64 \u03bcm at x = 0.28\u20135.69 \u03bcm at x = 0.32. This might be due to the increased BT with high melting point (1618 \xb0C), which lead to the weakened grain growth kinetics under the same sintering temperature. This observation aligns with previous reports in (1-x)BF-xBT. Moreover, the relative densities of all compositions are around 90 %, as shown in (f). To further analyze and understand the local structural changes, Raman spectroscopy analysis is employed. (a) shows the BLF-xBT Raman spectra in the wavenumber range of 150\u2013800 cmE^{\u22121}. For R phase of BiFeO3 at room temperature, there are 13 Raman active modes in theory: \u0393Raman = 4A1+9E (R3c, CE^{6} 3v, Z = 2). However, only 8 Raman active modes were detected due to some weak and overlapping modes. In the region of 150\u2013400 cmE^{\u22121}, the main contribution to the spectra is from the strength of B-O band. As BT content (x) increases from 0.285 to 0.32, the relative bump Raman mode around 300 cmE^{\u22121} undergoes a transition to flatten one, indicating a weakening of the B-site cation vibrations and a reduction of ferroelectric order. This is confirmed by the redshift of A1-2 mode and a decreased intensity ratio of I(A1-2)/1(E\u22122) in (b). In the high wave-number region of x > 400 cmE^{\u22121}, the modes reflect the tilting of internal BO6 octahedron , the Raman peak composed of the A1-4, E\u22125 and E\u22126 modes gradually becomes sharper with increasing x, revealing a decrease in the distortion of the BO6 octahedra. In addition, the blueshift trend of A1-4 mode along with the increased intensity ratio of I(E\u22125)/(E\u22126) supported this viewpoint. shows the temperature dependence of dielectric constant \u03b5 r for BLF-xBT at 100 kHz. It is observed that the \u03b5 r of all samples remains relatively stable below 350 \xb0C. The dielectric peak appears at approximate 450 \xb0C, which marks a transition from the ferroelectric to the paraelectric phase, corresponding to T c. As indicated in the inset of , the T c for all samples exceeds 440 \xb0C, indicating relatively high temperature stability of dielectric and ferroelectric properties. With the addition of LaE^{3+}, the T c decreases from 453 \xb0C for BF-0.3BT to 446 \xb0C for BLF-0.3BT. Additionally, an overall downward trend in T c is observed as the BT content increases. This reduction in T c can be attributed to the formation of the high-symmetry T phase with weaker ferroelectricity after the LaE^{3+} doping and increased BT content. Furthermore, when the BF is partically replaced by BT component, the dielectric peak becomes broaden, indicating a weakening of the ferroelectricity. This is caused by the decrement of R phase with low-symmetry. (a) presents the P-E loops of BLF-xBT. As the BT content increases to x = 0.295, the remanent polarization (P r) reaches its optimal value of 30.1 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} ((b)). Based on above XRD refinement, the two phase contents of x = 0.295 is almost equal, which makes thermodynamic energy barrier become more flattened, facilitating polarization rotation under an external electric field. The variation of d 33 and \u03b5 r with x is presented in (c). Clearly, the d 33 reaches a peak value of 179 pC/N at x = 0.295. This can be explained by the phenomenological theory: d 33 = 2\u03b5 0 \u03b5 r Q 11 P s, where the \u03b5 0 is the vacuum dielectric constant, \u03b5 r is the relative dielectric constant, Q 11 is the electrostrictive coefficient, P s is the spontaneous polarization, which is similar to P r. Based on the changes in P r and \u03b5 r, a relatively high \u03b5 r along with the largest P r at x = 0.295 result in the highest value of d 33 at this point. Selected compositions (BLF-0.3BT, BLF-0.31BT and BLF-0.32BT) with a higher content of the T phase near MPB were further experienced air quenching, to restore the phase ratio to the optimal coexistence state and improve their piezoelectric property. shows the d 33 of BLF-xBT (x = 0.30Q, 0.31Q, 0.32Q) before and after quenching treatment. Clearly, a significant improvement of d 33 is observed in all compositions, among which the BLF-0.32BT achieved the highest piezoelectric performance (d 33 = 205 pC/N), as well as the largest enhancement of 34 %. Then the BLF-0.32BT is chosen to trace this distinct improvement of piezoelectric property. The XRD patterns of the BLF-xBT (x = 0.295, 0.32, 0.32Q) are shown in (a). For x = 0.295, an asymmetric (110) diffraction reflection along with (111) double reflections reveals the coexistence state of the R/T phase, as presented in the XRD refinement. With increasing x to 0.32, the asymmetry of the (110) peak weakens and the (111) doublet peaks merge into a single peak, indicating a partial transition from the R phase to the T phase((b) and (c)). Particularly, in the quenched sample (x = 0.32Q), the shape of the corresponding characteristic diffraction peaks can be clearly observed to be almost identical to those of x = 0.295, indicating that the phase ratio has changed after quenching, returning to the optimal coexistence state of the two phases. To further investigate the effect of quenching on defects of the samples, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of Fe in the BLF-xBT (x = 0.32, 0.32Q) was fitted with a Lorentzian function, and the results are shown in. According to the fitted area, the binding energies of FeE^{3+} and FeE^{2+} are located at 712eV and 709eV, respectively. The Fe 2p orbital is fitted as Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2. This process is a contributing factor to the high leakage current and dielectric loss observed in BF-BT-based ceramics. Generally, quenching treatment has significantly reduce the time the sample stays at high temperatures, which should effectively reduce the defect concentration of BF-BT. It is observed that after the quenching treatment, the proportion of FeE^{3+} increased from 58 % (x = 0.32) to 77.5 % (x = 0.32Q), implying the inhibition of Fe ion valence change by quenching treatment. shows the P-E loops of the BLF-xBT (x = 0.32, 0.32Q). P r increases from 26.9 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} (x = 0.32) to 33.7 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} (x = 0.32Q), while the E c remains unchanged post-quenching. This contributes to the enhanced ferroelectric property and increased the P r in the quenched sample. (a) and (b) show the dielectric constant as a function of temperature for BLF-xBT (x = 0.32, 0.32Q) at various frequencies. Post-quenching, the dielectric peak narrows significantly, and the frequency dispersion \u0394T m decreases from 18 \xb0C (x = 0.32) to 6 \xb0C (x = 0.32Q), indicating the ferroelectricity are notably enhanced. To further analyze and quantify the relaxation characteristics of phase transitions in the BLF-0.32BT post-quenching, the dispersion factir (\u03b3) was calculated using the modified Curie-Weiss : where \u03b5 m is the maximum of \u03b5 r, T m is the phase transition temperature, and C \u2032 is modified Curie constant. The value of \u03b3 ranges between 1 and 2. When \u03b3 is closer to 1, it indicates that the sample exhibits normal ferroelectric behavior; when \u03b3 is closer to 2, it indicates that the sample exhibits relaxor ferroelectric behavior. As shown in the inset of , the \u03b3 values for the x = 0.32 and x = 0.32Q are 1.63 and 1.54, respectively, indicating that the quenching treatment has reduced the relaxor nature(T phase) of the samples and promoted their transition towards a normal ferroelectric state(R phase), leading to the enhancement of ferroelectricity and the increment of T c. (a) and (b) display in situ k p and d 33 as a function of temperature for the BLF-xBT(x = 0.32,0.32Q). At this point, d 33 also starts to deteriorate rapidly. After the quenching treatment, the T d increases from 420 \xb0C (x = 0.32) to 460 \xb0C (x = 0.32Q), indicating that quenching effectively raises the depolarization temperature. As shown in (b), the quenched sample (x = 0.32Q) still maintains a d 33 of 190 pC/N at 440 \xb0C, which is 92.7 % of the origin value, indicating that the quenching treatment greatly improves the stability of the piezoelectric performance.
