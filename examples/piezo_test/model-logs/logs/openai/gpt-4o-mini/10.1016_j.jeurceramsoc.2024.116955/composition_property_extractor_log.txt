# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a) shows the room temperature XRD patterns of CLBBN-xCe ceramics in the 2\u03b8 range of 20\xb0 to 70\xb0. The observed diffraction peaks are indexed in accordance with the JCPDS-49\u20130608 (CaBi2Nb2O9), revealing that all samples and the original component samples have the same orthorhombic structure. Notably, the peak with highest intensity among the XRD patterns is identified as the (115) reflection, which corresponds to the theory that the most intense diffraction peak of the Aurivillius phase is the (112m+1). As shown in (b), the crystal structure evolution of the samples was further analyzed through the detailed analysis of the profiles near 29.5\xb0 and 33\xb0. It is observed that as x increases, the (115) peak progressively shifts toward higher 2\u03b8 angles, indicating a diminution in the lattice parameter with the increasing concentration of the Ce dopant. The (c) shows that the (200) and (020) peaks progressively coalesce with the incremental substitution of Ce, suggesting that the doping of Ce leads to the appearance of pseudo-tetragonal phase. The pseudo-tetragonal phase is conducive to polarization switching, and improves the spontaneous polarization (P s) of the CLBBN-xCe ceramics. In order to further analyze the influence of Ce-doping on the structure of CLBBN ceramics, Rietveld refinement for XRD profiles was conducted using the A21 am space group. (a)-(b) display the Rietveld refinement results for the CLBBN-xCe (x = 0 and 0.1) ceramics, respectively, which exhibit a high degree of agreement with the original XRD patterns. The refinement factors wR p, R p and chi E^{2} are all within an acceptable range. (c) shows the lattice parameters of CLBBN-xCe. As the Ce content increases, the a/b ratio declines, denoting an alleviation of orthogonal distortion whereas an intensification of pseudo-tetragonal distortion, which is consistent with the results that the (200) and (020) peaks are gradually merged in XRD patterns. (a)\u2013(e) show the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the thermally-etched CLBBN-xCe ceramics. This morphology is attributed to the enhanced grain growth rate within the a-b plane. (f) shows the grain size of the CLBBN-xCe ceramics as a function of the Ce dopant concentration x. Specifically, at the Ce doping levels of 0.1 and 0.15, the grain sizes are 5.16 \u03bcm and 4.13 \u03bcm, and the densities are 7.29 and 7.31 g/cmE^{3}, respectively. These results reveal that Ce-doping effectively refines the grain size and enhances the density of the ceramics, thereby potentially improving their piezoelectric properties and ferroelectric properties. (g)\u2013(l) display the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping of a thermally-etched CLBBN-0.1Ce ceramic. The uniform distribution of all elements can be observed, which is consistent with the results of XRD, and further confirms the diffusion of Ce ions into the CLBBN lattice. This uniform dispersion is crucial for the consistent performance and enhanced functionality of the piezoelectric materials. (a)-(b) respectively show the polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loops and the corresponding current-electric field (I-E) curves for the CLBBN-xCe (x = 0 and 0.1) ceramics, measured under a frequency of 1 Hz and the temperature of 180 \xb0C. Notably, the P-E loop for the CLBBN-0.1Ce ceramic exhibits a more pronounced saturation compared to the CLBBN ceramic. Upon Ce doping, the maximum electric field endurance of the samples is increased from 15 kV/mm to over 21 kV/mm. Concurrently, the remnant polarization P r increases from 9.67 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} to 30.89 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, showing the ceramic's excellent ferroelectric characteristics. These results indicate that an optimal concentration of Ce-doping can significantly improve the ferroelectric properties of CLBBN ceramics. Furthermore, (c)-(d) show the hysteresis loop P-E and current curve I-E of CLBBN-0.1Ce ceramics under different electric fields, respectively. The ferroelectricity of the ceramic is more clearly demonstrated at electric fields exceeding 150 kV/cm, which aligns with the requisite high electric field for sample polarization. (a) shows the composition-dependent d 33 values of the CLBBN-xCe ceramics at room temperature. With the increase of Ce dopant concentration, the d 33 value declines first, then increases to a peak at x = 0.1, reaching a high value of 21.7 pC/N, which is among the forefront of CBN-based high-temperature piezoelectric ceramics. The excellent piezoelectric properties were primarily attributed to the improvements of ferroelectric properties, and the facilitation of domain switching of CLBBN-xCe ceramics. Therefore, these various factors synergistically contribute to the high piezoelectric properties of CLBBN-xCe ceramics. In order to display the temperature-dependent d 33 of these ceramics in real time, the in situ temperature-dependent d 33 of CLBBN-xCe (x = 0, 0.1) were measured. As depicted in (b), the d 33 values of these ceramics exhibit a trend of initial increase, followed by a gradual stabilization, and ultimately a decline as temperature rises. Raising temperature may increase the mobility of the domain walls of CLBBN ceramic, thereby the extrinsic contribution results in increased piezoelectric coefficient. Notably, at 350 \xb0C, the d 33 of CLBBN-0.1Ce ceramics approaches 25 pC/N, which is approximately twice that of the undoped CLBBN ceramics. From room temperature to 400 \xb0C, the rate of change of d 33 of CLBBN-0.1Ce samples and CLBBN samples were 20.8 % and 19.7 %, respectively. However, it is observed that the depolarization temperature (450 \xb0C) for the CLBBN-0.1Ce ceramics is lower, compared to 500 \xb0C for the CLBBN ceramics. In BLSFs, the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layer acts as an insulating slab, the incorporation of Ce into (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layer leads to a decrease in the resistivity of CLBBN-0.1Ce ceramics. In addition, Ce ions can readily change their oxidation states between +3 and +4, if CeE^{4+} replaces NbE^{5+} in the B-site, oxygen vacancies will be generated. And when the temperature reaches up to 400 \xb0C, the activation energy of charge carrier (such as oxygen vacancies) decreases rapidly, the mobility of the oxygen vacancy increases, and the resistivity further decreases as the temperature increases, resulting in a decrease in the electrical properties of the ceramics at temperatures much lower than T C. Correlation between the d 33 and T C of previously reported CBN-based ceramics is shown in (c). These findings indicate that an optimal Ce-doping concentration substantially boosts the piezoelectric properties of CLBBN ceramics, although this results in a slightly higher sensitivity to temperature variations in their piezoelectric performance. To delve deeper into the phase-transition behavior of the Ce-doped CLBBN-based ceramics at high temperature, temperature dependence of Raman spectra for the samples was characterized. (a)-(b) show the temperature dependence of Raman spectra for the representative CLBBN-xCe (x = 0 and 0.1) samples, recorded within the wavenumber range of 100\u20131000 cmE^{\u22121} and across a temperature span of 25\u2013500 \xb0C. All the samples show the same phonon modes at about 189, 213, 597, 822 cmE^{\u22121}. As temperature rises, there is a general attenuation in the intensity of the Raman peaks, accompanied by a progressive reduction in the number of discernible peaks in the Raman spectra. (c)-(f) focus on the specific modes at 189 cmE^{\u22121} (denoted by v2), 213 cmE^{\u22121} (v3), 597 cmE^{\u22121} (v7), and 822 cmE^{\u22121} (v9). It can be seen that the v2 and v3 modes exhibit a slight lower-frequency shift after Ce-doping, which is indicative of alterations in the vibrational modes of the A-site cations. Moreover, the mode at 597 cmE^{\u22121} (v7) shifts significantly to a lower frequency after Ce-doping, suggesting a reduction in vibration of the NbO6 octahedron. The mode at 822 cmE^{\u22121} (v9) is correlated with the structural symmetry of the material. It is evident that as the temperature increases, the v2, v3, and v7 modes progressively downshift to lower frequencies. The variations in the v2 and v3 modes imply that the vibrations of the A-site ions are influenced by the temperature. The shifts in the v7 and v9 modes suggest that temperature-induced structural alterations are mediated through changes in the Nb-O bond lengths. Observations indicate that beyond 350 \xb0C, the alterations in the modes of the CLBBN-0.1Ce ceramics are markedly subdued. Concurrently, the in situ temperature-dependent d 33 measurements reveal a notable decrement in the d 33 values starting at approximately 350 \xb0C. This correlation suggests a linkage between the attenuation of modal variations and the decline in piezoelectric performance, pinpointing 350 \xb0C as a critical threshold where significant changes in the material's properties are observed. (a) shows the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant \u03b5 r of the CLBBN-xCe (x = 0 and 0.1) ceramics measured at a frequency of 1 MHz. The dielectric constant \u03b5 r of both ceramics exhibits a pronounced peak at the Curie temperature, signifying the critical phase transition from ferroelectric phase to paraelectric phase. Notably, the Curie temperature of the CLBBN-0.1Ce ceramics (907 \xb0C) is slightly lower than that of the CLBBN ceramics (920 \xb0C). In addition, For BLSFs families, oxygen vacancies will be generated due to the Bi-loss during the sintering process. Therefore, a weak dielectric anomaly can be observed in the range of 600\u2013800 \xb0C, which may be associated with the defect-related dielectric response. (b) presents the temperature dependence of the dielectric loss tan\u03b4 of the CLBBN-xCe (x = 0 and 0.1) ceramics, also measured at 1 MHz. At high temperature, the dielectric loss tan\u03b4 of the CLBBN-0.1Ce ceramics is slightly higher than that of the CLBBN ceramics. However, it is noteworthy that the dielectric loss tan\u03b4 for both ceramics does not exhibit a significant increase up to a temperature of 450 \xb0C. The dielectric loss tan\u03b4 at 450 \xb0C is just 0.025 for the CLBBN-0.1Ce ceramic. It also shows a strong thermal stability of the CLBBN-0.1Ce samples, which is an important prerequisite for the application of ceramics at high temperatures. These findings collectively suggest that the Ce-doped CLBBN ceramics have substantial potential for high-temperature applications. In order to further explore the origins of the excellent properties exhibited by Ce-doped CLBBN samples, an investigation into the domain morphologies was undertaken. (a)-(b) display the out-of-plane phase images of CLBBN-xCe (x = 0 and 0.1) ceramics, as captured by piezoelectric response force microscopy (PFM) at room temperature. A comparison reveals that the CLBBN-0.1Ce ceramic possesses a domain structure with denser and more finely delineated stripe domains compared to the CLBBN ceramic. The finer domain structures, characterized by lower domain wall energy, are more amenable to external stimuli, which is believed to be one of the contributing factors to the excellent piezoelectric properties of the CLBBN-0.1Ce ceramics.

# ABSTRACT
In this study, the phase structure, microstructure, and thermal stability of Ce-doped CaBi2Nb2O9 (CLBBN-xCe) high-temperature bismuth layer-structured piezoceramics are studied. It is revealed that the CLBBN-0.1Ce ceramics stand out with a piezoelectric coefficient d
                     33 of 21.7 pC/N and a high Curie temperature of 907 Â°C. Furthermore, in situ temperature measurement demonstrates that the d
                     33 has a change rate of 20.8â¯% from room temperature to 400 Â°C. We found that grain size refinement and domain morphology contribute to excellent electrical properties of the Ce-doped CaBi2Nb2O9-based ceramics.

# INTRODUCTION
Piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) is one of the most important parameters to measure the piezoelectric properties of materials, and its value is sensitive to temperature fluctuations. To maintain the safety and reliability of piezoelectric ceramics, their operational temperature is usually limited to below 50 % of the Curie temperature, which significantly curtails their potential applications. Currently, the commercial applications of BLSFs are predominantly focused on ceramics based on Bi4Ti3O12, which features a three-layer structure, and CaBi4Ti4O15, with a four-layer configuration. These materials are primarily utilized in applications that require operation temperatures of up to 260 \xb0C and 482 \xb0C, respectively, highlighting their tailored performance for specific thermal conditions. Bismuth-layered ferroelectrics, represented by CaBi2Nb2O9 (CBN), are promising candidates for high-temperature piezoelectric applications due to their exceptional thermal stability and elevated Curie temperatures, but they have relatively low intrinsic piezoelectric properties. To enhance the performance of CBN ceramics for wider high-temperature applications, numerous modification strategies have been explored. For example, Liu et al. successfully enhanced the piezoelectricity of CBN ceramics through (Na, Ce) modification, significantly enhanced the thermal stability of the lattice by reducing the rotation of the Nb-O octahedron during thermal depoling process, which is still maintaining 92 % of the initial d 33 after depoling at 600 \xb0C. Shen et al. fabricated a Ce and W co-doped Ca0.96Ce0.04Bi2Nb2-xWxO9 ceramic using conventional solid-state sintering method, achieving a d 33 of 13.4 pC/N and a resistivity \u03c1 of 3.7 \xd7 10E^{9} \u03a9 cm at 500 \xb0C, along with remarkable thermal stability up to 800 \xb0C. Wang et al. reported on Cu/W co-doped Ca2Bi2Nb2-x(Cu1/4W3/4)xO9 high Curie temperature piezoelectric ceramics, exhibiting a d 33 of 13.8 pC/N and a Curie temperature of 918 \xb0C. These ceramics demonstrated commendable thermal stability, retaining a d 33 of 12.7 pC/N after annealing at 900 \xb0C for 30 mins. Luo et al. improved the piezoelectric properties and thermal stability of CBN-based ceramics by NaE^{+} and SmE^{3+} co-doping, yielding a d 33 of 12.8 pC/N and a Curie temperature of 949 \xb0C. After annealing treatment at 900 \xb0C for 2 h, the d 33 value of the materials remained at approximately 90 % of its initial value. Despite these significant advances, the majority of current researches on the thermal stability of CaBi2Nb2O9 based ceramics concentrated on the ex situ high temperature stability (annealing at high temperature for 1\u20132 h). The d 33 values are measured after high-temperature annealing, which may not accurately represent the d 33 values at actual high temperature environment. There is a scarcity of studies that apply in situ temperature-dependent d 33 measurement to CaBi2Nb2O9 based ceramics. In this work, we improve the electrical properties of CBN-based piezoelectric ceramics by Ce doping replaces Bi ions in (Bi2O2)E^{2+} on the basis of replacing Ca with Li/Bi at A-site. The resulting Ca0.6(Li0.5Bi0.5)0.4Bi2\u20130.4xCe0.4xNb2O9 (CLBBN-xCe) ceramic exhibits a high d 33 value of 21.7 pC/N and a high Curie temperature of 907 \xb0C, substantially outperforming the pristine CBN ceramics in terms of piezoelectric response. In addition, in situ temperature-dependent measurements demonstrate that the d 33 value of the CLBBN-0.1Ce ceramics at 420 \xb0C retains 90 % of its value at room temperature, underscoring its exceptional piezoelectric properties and thermal stability.

# CONCLUSION
The CLBBN-xCe ceramics, with varying Ce concentrations (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2), were synthesized by the solid-state reaction method. The systematical study results reveal the impact of Ce-doping on the electric properties and thermal stability of CBN-based ceramics. It is noteworthy that the CLBBN-0.1Ce ceramic exhibits a maximum d 33 value of 21.7 pC/N, complemented by a high Curie temperature of 907 \xb0C. In the in situ temperature-dependent d 33 measurements, from room temperature to 400 \xb0C, the rate of change of d 33 of CLBBN-0.1Ce samples is 20.8 %, which is also an important attribute for practical applications. The results of this study highlight the significant advantages of the Ce-doped CLBBN ceramics, suggesting their promising potential for application in high-temperature environments.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a) shows the room temperature XRD patterns of CLBBN-xCe ceramics in the 2\u03b8 range of 20\xb0 to 70\xb0. The observed diffraction peaks are indexed in accordance with the JCPDS-49\u20130608 (CaBi2Nb2O9), revealing that all samples and the original component samples have the same orthorhombic structure.

It is observed that as x increases, the (115) peak progressively shifts toward higher 2\u03b8 angles, indicating a diminution in the lattice parameter with the increasing concentration of the Ce dopant. The (c) shows that the (200) and (020) peaks progressively coalesce with the incremental substitution of Ce, suggesting that the doping of Ce leads to the appearance of pseudo-tetragonal phase. The pseudo-tetragonal phase is conducive to polarization switching, and improves the spontaneous polarization (P s) of the CLBBN-xCe ceramics. In order to further analyze the influence of Ce-doping on the structure of CLBBN ceramics, Rietveld refinement for XRD profiles was conducted using the A21 am space group. (a)-(b) display the Rietveld refinement results for the CLBBN-xCe (x = 0 and 0.1) ceramics, respectively, which exhibit a high degree of agreement with the original XRD patterns. The refinement factors wR p, R p and chi E^{2} are all within an acceptable range. (c) shows the lattice parameters of CLBBN-xCe.

(f) shows the grain size of the CLBBN-xCe ceramics as a function of the Ce dopant concentration x. Specifically, at the Ce doping levels of 0.1 and 0.15, the grain sizes are 5.16 \u03bcm and 4.13 \u03bcm, and the densities are 7.29 and 7.31 g/cmE^{3}, respectively. These results reveal that Ce-doping effectively refines the grain size and enhances the density of the ceramics, thereby potentially improving their piezoelectric properties and ferroelectric properties. (g)\u2013(l) display the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping of a thermally-etched CLBBN-0.1Ce ceramic. The uniform distribution of all elements can be observed, which is consistent with the results of XRD, and further confirms the diffusion of Ce ions into the CLBBN lattice. This uniform dispersion is crucial for the consistent performance and enhanced functionality of the piezoelectric materials. (a)-(b) respectively show the polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loops and the corresponding current-electric field (I-E) curves for the CLBBN-xCe (x = 0 and 0.1) ceramics, measured under a frequency of 1 Hz and the temperature of 180 \xb0C. Notably, the P-E loop for the CLBBN-0.1Ce ceramic exhibits a more pronounced saturation compared to the CLBBN ceramic. Upon Ce doping, the maximum electric field endurance of the samples is increased from 15 kV/mm to over 21 kV/mm. Concurrently, the remnant polarization P r increases from 9.67 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} to 30.89 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, showing the ceramic's excellent ferroelectric characteristics. These results indicate that an optimal concentration of Ce-doping can significantly improve the ferroelectric properties of CLBBN ceramics. Furthermore, (c)-(d) show the hysteresis loop P-E and current curve I-E of CLBBN-0.1Ce ceramics under different electric fields, respectively. The ferroelectricity of the ceramic is more clearly demonstrated at electric fields exceeding 150 kV/cm, which aligns with the requisite high electric field for sample polarization. (a) shows the composition-dependent d 33 values of the CLBBN-xCe ceramics at room temperature. With the increase of Ce dopant concentration, the d 33 value declines first, then increases to a peak at x = 0.1, reaching a high value of 21.7 pC/N, which is among the forefront of CBN-based high-temperature piezoelectric ceramics. The excellent piezoelectric properties were primarily attributed to the improvements of ferroelectric properties, and the facilitation of domain switching of CLBBN-xCe ceramics. Therefore, these various factors synergistically contribute to the high piezoelectric properties of CLBBN-xCe ceramics. In order to display the temperature-dependent d 33 of these ceramics in real time, the in situ temperature-dependent d 33 of CLBBN-xCe (x = 0, 0.1) were measured. As depicted in (b), the d 33 values of these ceramics exhibit a trend of initial increase, followed by a gradual stabilization, and ultimately a decline as temperature rises. Raising temperature may increase the mobility of the domain walls of CLBBN ceramic, thereby the extrinsic contribution results in increased piezoelectric coefficient. Notably, at 350 \xb0C, the d 33 of CLBBN-0.1Ce ceramics approaches 25 pC/N, which is approximately twice that of the undoped CLBBN ceramics. From room temperature to 400 \xb0C, the rate of change of d 33 of CLBBN-0.1Ce samples and CLBBN samples were 20.8 % and 19.7 %, respectively. However, it is observed that the depolarization temperature (450 \xb0C) for the CLBBN-0.1Ce ceramics is lower, compared to 500 \xb0C for the CLBBN ceramics. In BLSFs, the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layer acts as an insulating slab, the incorporation of Ce into (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layer leads to a decrease in the resistivity of CLBBN-0.1Ce ceramics. In addition, Ce ions can readily change their oxidation states between +3 and +4, if CeE^{4+} replaces NbE^{5+} in the B-site, oxygen vacancies will be generated. And when the temperature reaches up to 400 \xb0C, the activation energy of charge carrier (such as oxygen vacancies) decreases rapidly, the mobility of the oxygen vacancy increases, and the resistivity further decreases as the temperature increases, resulting in a decrease in the electrical properties of the ceramics at temperatures much lower than T C. Correlation between the d 33 and T C of previously reported CBN-based ceramics is shown in (c). These findings indicate that an optimal Ce-doping concentration substantially boosts the piezoelectric properties of CLBBN ceramics, although this results in a slightly higher sensitivity to temperature variations in their piezoelectric performance. To delve deeper into the phase-transition behavior of the Ce-doped CLBBN-based ceramics at high temperature, temperature dependence of Raman spectra for the samples was characterized. (a)-(b) show the temperature dependence of Raman spectra for the representative CLBBN-xCe (x = 0 and 0.1) samples, recorded within the wavenumber range of 100\u20131000 cmE^{\u22121} and across a temperature span of 25\u2013500 \xb0C. All the samples show the same phonon modes at about 189, 213, 597, 822 cmE^{\u22121}. As temperature rises, there is a general attenuation in the intensity of the Raman peaks, accompanied by a progressive reduction in the number of discernible peaks in the Raman spectra. (c)-(f) focus on the specific modes at 189 cmE^{\u22121} (denoted by v2), 213 cmE^{\u22121} (v3), 597 cmE^{\u22121} (v7), and 822 cmE^{\u22121} (v9). It can be seen that the v2 and v3 modes exhibit a slight lower-frequency shift after Ce-doping, which is indicative of alterations in the vibrational modes of the A-site cations. Moreover, the mode at 597 cmE^{\u22121} (v7) shifts significantly to a lower frequency after Ce-doping, suggesting a reduction in vibration of the NbO6 octahedron. The mode at 822 cmE^{\u22121} (v9) is correlated with the structural symmetry of the material. It is evident that as the temperature increases, the v2, v3, and v7 modes progressively downshift to lower frequencies. The variations in the v2 and v3 modes imply that the vibrations of the A-site ions are influenced by the temperature. The shifts in the v7 and v9 modes suggest that temperature-induced structural alterations are mediated through changes in the Nb-O bond lengths. Observations indicate that beyond 350 \xb0C, the alterations in the modes of the CLBBN-0.1Ce ceramics are markedly subdued. Concurrently, the in situ temperature-dependent d 33 measurements reveal a notable decrement in the d 33 values starting at approximately 350 \xb0C. This correlation suggests a linkage between the attenuation of modal variations and the decline in piezoelectric performance, pinpointing 350 \xb0C as a critical threshold where significant changes in the material's properties are observed. (a) shows the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant \u03b5 r of the CLBBN-xCe (x = 0 and 0.1) ceramics measured at a frequency of 1 MHz. The dielectric constant \u03b5 r of both ceramics exhibits a pronounced peak at the Curie temperature, signifying the critical phase transition from ferroelectric phase to paraelectric phase. Notably, the Curie temperature of the CLBBN-0.1Ce ceramics (907 \xb0C) is slightly lower than that of the CLBBN ceramics (920 \xb0C). In addition, For BLSFs families, oxygen vacancies will be generated due to the Bi-loss during the sintering process. Therefore, a weak dielectric anomaly can be observed in the range of 600\u2013800 \xb0C, which may be associated with the defect-related dielectric response. (b) presents the temperature dependence of the dielectric loss tan\u03b4 of the CLBBN-xCe (x = 0 and 0.1) ceramics, also measured at 1 MHz. At high temperature, the dielectric loss tan\u03b4 of the CLBBN-0.1Ce ceramics is slightly higher than that of the CLBBN ceramics. However, it is noteworthy that the dielectric loss tan\u03b4 for both ceramics does not exhibit a significant increase up to a temperature of 450 \xb0C. The dielectric loss tan\u03b4 at 450 \xb0C is just 0.025 for the CLBBN-0.1Ce ceramic. It also shows a strong thermal stability of the CLBBN-0.1Ce samples, which is an important prerequisite for the application of ceramics at high temperatures. These findings collectively suggest that the Ce-doped CLBBN ceramics have substantial potential for high-temperature applications. In order to further explore the origins of the excellent properties exhibited by Ce-doped CLBBN samples, an investigation into the domain morphologies was undertaken. (a)-(b) display the out-of-plane phase images of CLBBN-xCe (x = 0 and 0.1) ceramics, as captured by piezoelectric response force microscopy (PFM) at room temperature. A comparison reveals that the CLBBN-0.1Ce ceramic possesses a domain structure with denser and more finely delineated stripe domains compared to the CLBBN ceramic. The finer domain structures, characterized by lower domain wall energy, are more amenable to external stimuli, which is believed to be one of the contributing factors to the excellent piezoelectric properties of the CLBBN-0.1Ce ceramics.

# ABSTRACT
In this study, the phase structure, microstructure, and thermal stability of Ce-doped CaBi2Nb2O9 (CLBBN-xCe) high-temperature bismuth layer-structured piezoceramics are studied. It is revealed that the CLBBN-0.1Ce ceramics stand out with a piezoelectric coefficient d
                     33 of 21.7 pC/N and a high Curie temperature of 907 Â°C. Furthermore, in situ temperature measurement demonstrates that the d
                     33 has a change rate of 20.8â¯% from room temperature to 400 Â°C. We found that grain size refinement and domain morphology contribute to excellent electrical properties of the Ce-doped CaBi2Nb2O9-based ceramics.

# INTRODUCTION
Piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) is one of the most important parameters to measure the piezoelectric properties of materials, and its value is sensitive to temperature fluctuations. To maintain the safety and reliability of piezoelectric ceramics, their operational temperature is usually limited to below 50 % of the Curie temperature, which significantly curtails their potential applications. Currently, the commercial applications of BLSFs are predominantly focused on ceramics based on Bi4Ti3O12, which features a three-layer structure, and CaBi4Ti4O15, with a four-layer configuration. These materials are primarily utilized in applications that require operation temperatures of up to 260 \xb0C and 482 \xb0C, respectively, highlighting their tailored performance for specific thermal conditions. Bismuth-layered ferroelectrics, represented by CaBi2Nb2O9 (CBN), are promising candidates for high-temperature piezoelectric applications due to their exceptional thermal stability and elevated Curie temperatures, but they have relatively low intrinsic piezoelectric properties. To enhance the performance of CBN ceramics for wider high-temperature applications, numerous modification strategies have been explored. For example, Liu et al. successfully enhanced the piezoelectricity of CBN ceramics through (Na, Ce) modification, significantly enhanced the thermal stability of the lattice by reducing the rotation of the Nb-O octahedron during thermal depoling process, which is still maintaining 92 % of the initial d 33 after depoling at 600 \xb0C. Shen et al. fabricated a Ce and W co-doped Ca0.96Ce0.04Bi2Nb2-xWxO9 ceramic using conventional solid-state sintering method, achieving a d 33 of 13.4 pC/N and a resistivity \u03c1 of 3.7 \xd7 10E^{9} \u03a9 cm at 500 \xb0C, along with remarkable thermal stability up to 800 \xb0C. Wang et al. reported on Cu/W co-doped Ca2Bi2Nb2-x(Cu1/4W3/4)xO9 high Curie temperature piezoelectric ceramics, exhibiting a d 33 of 13.8 pC/N and a Curie temperature of 918 \xb0C. These ceramics demonstrated commendable thermal stability, retaining a d 33 of 12.7 pC/N after annealing at 900 \xb0C for 30 mins. Luo et al. improved the piezoelectric properties and thermal stability of CBN-based ceramics by NaE^{+} and SmE^{3+} co-doping, yielding a d 33 of 12.8 pC/N and a Curie temperature of 949 \xb0C. After annealing treatment at 900 \xb0C for 2 h, the d 33 value of the materials remained at approximately 90 % of its initial value. Despite these significant advances, the majority of current researches on the thermal stability of CaBi2Nb2O9 based ceramics concentrated on the ex situ high temperature stability (annealing at high temperature for 1\u20132 h). The d 33 values are measured after high-temperature annealing, which may not accurately represent the d 33 values at actual high temperature environment. There is a scarcity of studies that apply in situ temperature-dependent d 33 measurement to CaBi2Nb2O9 based ceramics. In this work, we improve the electrical properties of CBN-based piezoelectric ceramics by Ce doping replaces Bi ions in (Bi2O2)E^{2+} on the basis of replacing Ca with Li/Bi at A-site. The resulting Ca0.6(Li0.5Bi0.5)0.4Bi2\u20130.4xCe0.4xNb2O9 (CLBBN-xCe) ceramic exhibits a high d 33 value of 21.7 pC/N and a high Curie temperature of 907 \xb0C, substantially outperforming the pristine CBN ceramics in terms of piezoelectric response. In addition, in situ temperature-dependent measurements demonstrate that the d 33 value of the CLBBN-0.1Ce ceramics at 420 \xb0C retains 90 % of its value at room temperature, underscoring its exceptional piezoelectric properties and thermal stability.

# CONCLUSION
The CLBBN-xCe ceramics, with varying Ce concentrations (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2), were synthesized by the solid-state reaction method. The systematical study results reveal the impact of Ce-doping on the electric properties and thermal stability of CBN-based ceramics. It is noteworthy that the CLBBN-0.1Ce ceramic exhibits a maximum d 33 value of 21.7 pC/N, complemented by a high Curie temperature of 907 \xb0C. In the in situ temperature-dependent d 33 measurements, from room temperature to 400 \xb0C, the rate of change of d 33 of CLBBN-0.1Ce samples is 20.8 %, which is also an important attribute for practical applications. The results of this study highlight the significant advantages of the Ce-doped CLBBN ceramics, suggesting their promising potential for application in high-temperature environments.
