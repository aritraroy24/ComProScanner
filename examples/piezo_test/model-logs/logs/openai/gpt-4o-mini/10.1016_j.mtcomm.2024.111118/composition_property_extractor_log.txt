# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
presents the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the BTF-100xHo ceramics. All diffraction peaks are accurately indexed to the standard PDF card (PDF#89\u20138545), confirming the presence of a single orthorhombic phase with the space group A21 am. No impurity phases were detected in any of the samples, suggesting successful incorporation of holmium dopant ions into the pseudo-perovskite layers, occupying the A-site (i.e., BiE^{3+} site) due to their similar effective ionic radii. The strongest diffraction peak, indexed as (119), aligns with the (112m+1) reflection, which corresponds to the strongest diffraction peak of BLSFs. The diffraction peaks are located in nearly identical positions across different holmium contents, indicating no significant changes in the XRD patterns of holmium-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15. This suggests that the crystal lattice parameters remain almost unchanged with increasing holmium content, which can be attributed to the similar ionic radii of HoE^{3+} (124 pm, 12CN) and BiE^{3+} (131 pm, 12CN). Therefore, the introduction of holmium ions primarily affects the local bond structure without altering the overall lattice structure. presents the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the as-synthesized Bi5Ti3FeO15, BTF-4Ho, and BTF-8Ho. The SEM images prominently display plate-like grains, a typical feature of BLSF ceramics. This anisotropy is attributed to the high grain growth rate perpendicular to the c-axis, a unique characteristic of BLSFs. Additionally, the SEM images show that the holmium substitution in Bi5Ti3FeO15 leads to larger grain sizes, which reduces the formation of grain boundaries and defects, thereby enhancing the piezoelectric properties. The dense, pore-free microstructure further indicates that these ceramics can withstand large electric fields, which is beneficial for their dielectric, ferroelectric, and piezoelectric performance. presents the temperature-dependent dielectric constant \u03b5 r and dielectric loss tan\u03b4 of the BTF-100xHo, measured at a frequency of 1 MHz. The T C of Bi5Ti3FeO15 is 761 \xb0C, which is consistent with previously reported data. The physical parameters of the dielectric properties of BTF-100xHo are listed in. T C increases from 761 \xb0C for pure Bi5Ti3FeO15 to 796 \xb0C for BTF-8Ho. The tolerance factor is defined as t = (R A +R O)/2(R B +R O), where R A , R B , and R O are the ionic radii of the A-site cation, B-site cation, and oxygen ion, respectively. Replacing BiE^{3+} with HoE^{3+}, which has a smaller ionic radius, reduces the parameter t and results in an increase in T C. Similarly, doping the A-site in other bismuth-based layered materials follows this pattern. (B) also shows the temperature-dependent dielectric loss tan\u03b4 of the BTF-100xHo. In the wide temperature range of room temperature to 500 \xb0C, the dielectric loss tan\u03b4 remains quite low. However, once the temperature exceeds 600 \xb0C, the increase in high-temperature conductivity and the thermal activation of domain wall motion dramatically increase the dielectric loss tan\u03b4. The inset of (B) presents the dielectric loss tan\u03b4 on a logarithmic scale to visually demonstrate the variation trend. The composition of BTF-8Ho exhibits the lowest dielectric loss tan\u03b4 among the holmium-substituted BTF ceramics. For effective comparison, shows the T C and d 33 of reported Bi5Ti3FeO15 based ceramics. In the context of comparison with other Bi5Ti3FeO15 based materials, this study has achieved a significant enhancement in the T C, reaching up to 795 \xb0C for BTF-4Ho, as well as a substantial increase in the piezoelectric constant d 33, reaching 23.1 pC/N. These results highlight the potential of BTF-4Ho for high-temperature piezoelectric applications. presents the polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loops and electric current-electric field (J-E) loops of Bi5Ti3FeO15, BTF-4Ho, and BTF-8Ho ceramics measured at 150 \xb0C and at a frequency of 1 Hz at a drive electric field of 190 kV/cm. All Bi5Ti3FeO15 ceramics exhibit typical ferroelectric P-E loops, and the switching electric current peak provides a more accurate evaluation of the ferroelectric properties of the materials , see (B). The P r and E c of Bi5Ti3FeO15 are 11.8 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} and 63.8 kV/cm, respectively. In comparison, the P r and E c of BTF-4Ho are 6.6 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} and 65.4 kV/cm, and for BTF-8Ho, they are 9.4 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} and 71.4 kV/cm. The ferroelectric properties of Bi5Ti3FeO15 decrease after holmium (Ho) doping, which we attribute to an increase in oxygen vacancies. Although the decrease in P r (or P s) seems inconsistent with the increase in the piezoelectric performance, herein d 33, the polarization of ferroelectrics originates from the alignment of ferroelectric domains parallel to the poling field. Therefore, there is no inevitable correlation between ferroelectric properties and piezoelectric properties. (A) shows the temperature dependence of dc electrical resistivity for the BTF-100xHo in the temperature range of 200\u2013450 \xb0C. The pure and holmium-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15 ceramics show high resistivity of >10E^{5} \u03a9\xb7cm up to 450 \xb0C. Moreover, the holmium-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15 ceramic exhibits a lower resistivity compared to the pure Bi5Ti3FeO15 ceramic. Similar phenomena have been reported in other ions substituted BLSFs. To further investigate its conductivity, (B) shows the activation energy (E a) according to the Arrhenius law, given by \u03c1=\u03c1 0exp(-E a/k B T). Here, \u03c1 0 is a pre-exponential factor, E a is the activation energy, k B is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the thermodynamic temperature. The E a of intrinsic conduction for Bi5Ti3FeO15 based ceramics should be <1.6 eV. The activation energy E a for the samples, which falls between 0.77 and 0.95 eV, is comparable to the values for thermal-activated oxygen vacancies. summarizes the dielectric, piezoelectric, and electromechanical properties of BTF-100xHo ceramics at room temperature. Compared with pure Bi5Ti3FeO15, all Ho-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15 ceramics exhibit larger d 33 values. The d 33 values increase with increasing holmium content up to x=0.04 and then decrease with further increases. BTF-4Ho exhibits the maximum d 33 value of 23.1 pC/N, which is three times higher than that of pure Bi5Ti3FeO15. These results indicate that the piezoelectric performance of Bi5Ti3FeO15 can be effectively enhanced by substituting HoE^{3+} for BiE^{3+} at the A-site. The T C of BTF-4Ho has been measured to be 795 \xb0C, representing an improvement over the pure Bi5Ti3FeO15, and compared with the pure Bi5Ti3FeO15, the introduction of holmium ions reduces the dielectric loss tan\u03b4. The k p of substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15 increases from 4.6 % to 5.2 % for BTF-4Ho. The planar mechanical quality factor (Q mp) significantly increases from 1877 to 2948 with holmium substitution. To study the thermal stability of the piezoelectric properties of holmium-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15 ceramics, the planar electromechanical coupling coefficient (k p) was measured at various temperatures. shows the frequency-dependent electrical impedance (|Z|) of BTF-4Ho in planar mode at different temperatures. The resonance amplitude gradually decreases as the temperature rises from 20 \xb0C to 380 \xb0C, and then rapidly decreases with further temperature increase, which can be attributed to the increase in conductance at high temperatures. At 380 \xb0C, the amplitude of the resonant peak remains relatively high, indicating a good resonance and anti-resonance response. This suggests that the resonance characteristics of BTF-4Ho exhibit excellent thermal stability below 380 \xb0C. Based on the impedance spectrum's temperature variations, the resonant frequency (f r) and anti-resonant frequency (f a) of BTF-4Ho in k p mode are depicted in the inset of (b). Below 400 \xb0C, the resonant frequency shows an almost linear decline trend, indicating promising potential for resonator applications.

Our findings reveal that the holmium-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15 compositions exhibit significantly improved piezoelectric behavior in comparison to their unmodified counterparts.

# INTRODUCTION
The dominant commercial piezoelectric ceramics are lead-based, represented by lead zirconate-titanate (PZT). However, the relatively low Curie temperature (T C) of \u223c360 \xb0C for PZT limits its applicability in high-temperature environments such as aerospace, automotive electronics, and geological exploration. In a variety of high-temperature piezoelectric ceramics, bismuth layer-structured ferroelectrics (BLSFs) have been widely studied for their high T C, large spontaneous polarization (P s), and low dielectric loss. Bismuth titanate-ferrite (Bi5Ti3FeO15) is a typical four-layer (m = 4) BLSF compound. Structurally, Bi5Ti3FeO15 consists of a four-layer intergrown ABO3 perovskite unit of (Bi3Ti3FeO13)E^{2-} sandwiched by a (Bi2O2)E^{2+} unit along the c-axis. In this structure, BiE^{3+} ions in (Bi3Ti3FeO13)E^{2-} unit occupy the A-sites, while TiE^{4+} and FeE^{3+} ions are located at the B-sites with probabilities of 75 % and 25 %, respectively. The multiferroic, photocatalytic, and ferroelectric photovoltaic properties of BTF have been extensively investigated. Moure et al. reported an enhanced piezoelectric constant (d 33) of 18.6 pC/N in Bi5Ti3FeO15-CaBi4Ti4O15 (BTF-CBT), but found that the d 33 of pure Bi5Ti3FeO15 is 0 pC/N. Similarly, Huang et al. achieved a d 33 of 13.4 pC/N in (Na, Ce) co-modified Bi5Ti3FeO15, but no piezoelectricity was found in pure Bi5Ti3FeO15. Nevertheless, the inherent ferroelectricity of Bi5Ti3FeO15 indicates that it should exhibit piezoelectricity. Consequently, we conducted research on Bi5Ti3FeO15, and we obtained a d 33 of 7 pC/N for pure Bi5Ti3FeO15 and an enhanced d 33 of 23 pC/N for manganese (Mn)-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15, with the T C of BTF-4Mn (765 \xb0C) remaining almost unchanged compared to pure Bi5Ti3FeO15 (761 \xb0C). We also achieved a high d 33 of 24.3 pC/N for tungsten (W)-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15, with a T C of 793 \xb0C. According to previous works, substituting rare-earth ions with smaller ionic radii at the A-site of BLSFs significantly influences T C and piezoelectric properties. For example, substituting TbE^{3+} for CaE^{2+} in CaBi2Nb2O9 increased T C from 939 \xb0C to 973 \xb0C as TbE^{3+} content increased from 0 to 0.07 mol. Recent research has demonstrated that doping ferroelectric ceramics such as SrBi4Ti4O15, Bi5Ti3FeO15, and perovskite-type Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 with Ho ions can significantly improve their piezoelectric performance. Therefore, we fabricated holmium (Ho)-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15 ceramics using the conventional solid-state reaction method. We investigated the effects of HoE^{3+} substitution on the structural, dielectric, piezoelectric, and electrical properties of Bi5Ti3FeO15 ceramics in detail.

# CONCLUSION
Bi5Ti3FeO15 ceramics with holmium substitution are synthesized using conventional solid-state processing, and the effects of holmium on the structural, dielectric, piezoelectric, ferroelectric, and electrical properties of Bi5Ti3FeO15 ceramics were investigated in detail. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results revealed the crystal structure of the Bi5Ti3FeO15 ceramics, confirming the successful incorporation of holmium into the Bi5Ti3FeO15 lattice. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs indicated a significant increase in grain size for the holmium-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15 ceramics. The piezoelectric and dielectric properties of the Bi5Ti3FeO15 ceramics were notably enhanced by holmium substitution, with BTF-4Ho demonstrating superior performance, featuring a piezoelectric constant d 33 of 23.1 pC/N and a high Curie temperature T C of 795 \xb0C. Additionally, BTF-4Ho exhibited low dielectric losses at elevated temperatures and displayed remarkable thermal stability in its piezoelectric response and electromechanical coupling characteristics. These outstanding features suggest that holmium-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15 ceramics are promising candidates for high-temperature piezoelectric applications.

The d 33 values increase with increasing holmium content up to x=0.04 and then decrease with further increases. BTF-4Ho exhibits the maximum d 33 value of 23.1 pC/N, which is three times higher than that of pure Bi5Ti3FeO15. These results indicate that the piezoelectric performance of Bi5Ti3FeO15 can be effectively enhanced by substituting HoE^{3+} for BiE^{3+} at the A-site. The T C of BTF-4Ho has been measured to be 795 \xb0C, representing an improvement over the pure Bi5Ti3FeO15, and compared with the pure Bi5Ti3FeO15, the introduction of holmium ions reduces the dielectric loss tan\u03b4. The k p of substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15 increases from 4.6 % to 5.2 % for BTF-4Ho. The planar mechanical quality factor (Q mp) significantly increases from 1877 to 2948 with holmium substitution. To study the thermal stability of the piezoelectric properties of holmium-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15 ceramics, the planar electromechanical coupling coefficient (k p) was measured at various temperatures. shows the frequency-dependent electrical impedance (|Z|) of BTF-4Ho in planar mode at different temperatures. The resonance amplitude gradually decreases as the temperature rises from 20 \xb0C to 380 \xb0C, and then rapidly decreases with further temperature increase, which can be attributed to the increase in conductance at high temperatures. At 380 \xb0C, the amplitude of the resonant peak remains relatively high, indicating a good resonance and anti-resonance response. This suggests that the resonance characteristics of BTF-4Ho exhibit excellent thermal stability below 380 \xb0C. Based on the impedance spectrum's temperature variations, the resonant frequency (f r) and anti-resonant frequency (f a) of BTF-4Ho in k p mode are depicted in the inset of (b). Below 400 \xb0C, the resonant frequency shows an almost linear decline trend, indicating promising potential for resonator applications.

Our findings reveal that the holmium-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15 compositions exhibit significantly improved piezoelectric behavior in comparison to their unmodified counterparts.

# INTRODUCTION
The dominant commercial piezoelectric ceramics are lead-based, represented by lead zirconate-titanate (PZT). However, the relatively low Curie temperature (T C) of \u223c360 \xb0C for PZT limits its applicability in high-temperature environments such as aerospace, automotive electronics, and geological exploration. In a variety of high-temperature piezoelectric ceramics, bismuth layer-structured ferroelectrics (BLSFs) have been widely studied for their high T C, large spontaneous polarization (P s), and low dielectric loss. Bismuth titanate-ferrite (Bi5Ti3FeO15) is a typical four-layer (m = 4) BLSF compound. Structurally, Bi5Ti3FeO15 consists of a four-layer intergrown ABO3 perovskite unit of (Bi3Ti3FeO13)E^{2-} sandwiched by a (Bi2O2)E^{2+} unit along the c-axis. In this structure, BiE^{3+} ions in (Bi3Ti3FeO13)E^{2-} unit occupy the A-sites, while TiE^{4+} and FeE^{3+} ions are located at the B-sites with probabilities of 75 % and 25 %, respectively. The multiferroic, photocatalytic, and ferroelectric photovoltaic properties of BTF have been extensively investigated. Moure et al. reported an enhanced piezoelectric constant (d 33) of 18.6 pC/N in Bi5Ti3FeO15-CaBi4Ti4O15 (BTF-CBT), but found that the d 33 of pure Bi5Ti3FeO15 is 0 pC/N. Similarly, Huang et al. achieved a d 33 of 13.4 pC/N in (Na, Ce) co-modified Bi5Ti3FeO15, but no piezoelectricity was found in pure Bi5Ti3FeO15. Nevertheless, the inherent ferroelectricity of Bi5Ti3FeO15 indicates that it should exhibit piezoelectricity. Consequently, we conducted research on Bi5Ti3FeO15, and we obtained a d 33 of 7 pC/N for pure Bi5Ti3FeO15 and an enhanced d 33 of 23 pC/N for manganese (Mn)-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15, with the T C of BTF-4Mn (765 \xb0C) remaining almost unchanged compared to pure Bi5Ti3FeO15 (761 \xb0C). We also achieved a high d 33 of 24.3 pC/N for tungsten (W)-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15, with a T C of 793 \xb0C. According to previous works, substituting rare-earth ions with smaller ionic radii at the A-site of BLSFs significantly influences T C and piezoelectric properties. For example, substituting TbE^{3+} for CaE^{2+} in CaBi2Nb2O9 increased T C from 939 \xb0C to 973 \xb0C as TbE^{3+} content increased from 0 to 0.07 mol. Recent research has demonstrated that doping ferroelectric ceramics such as SrBi4Ti4O15, Bi5Ti3FeO15, and perovskite-type Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 with Ho ions can significantly improve their piezoelectric performance. Therefore, we fabricated holmium (Ho)-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15 ceramics using the conventional solid-state reaction method. We investigated the effects of HoE^{3+} substitution on the structural, dielectric, piezoelectric, and electrical properties of Bi5Ti3FeO15 ceramics in detail.

# CONCLUSION
Bi5Ti3FeO15 ceramics with holmium substitution are synthesized using conventional solid-state processing, and the effects of holmium on the structural, dielectric, piezoelectric, ferroelectric, and electrical properties of Bi5Ti3FeO15 ceramics were investigated in detail. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results revealed the crystal structure of the Bi5Ti3FeO15 ceramics, confirming the successful incorporation of holmium into the Bi5Ti3FeO15 lattice. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs indicated a significant increase in grain size for the holmium-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15 ceramics. The piezoelectric and dielectric properties of the Bi5Ti3FeO15 ceramics were notably enhanced by holmium substitution, with BTF-4Ho demonstrating superior performance, featuring a piezoelectric constant d 33 of 23.1 pC/N and a high Curie temperature T C of 795 \xb0C. Additionally, BTF-4Ho exhibited low dielectric losses at elevated temperatures and displayed remarkable thermal stability in its piezoelectric response and electromechanical coupling characteristics. These outstanding features suggest that holmium-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15 ceramics are promising candidates for high-temperature piezoelectric applications.
