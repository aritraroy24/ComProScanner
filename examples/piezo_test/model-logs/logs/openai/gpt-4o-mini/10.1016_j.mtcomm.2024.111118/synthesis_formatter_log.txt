Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'solid-state reaction', 'precursors': ['Bi2O3', 'Fe2O3', 'TiO2', 'Ho2O3'], 'steps': ['Weighed chemicals were wet-milled in polyethylene bottles with ZrO2 balls for 12 h in ethanol.', 'Calcination at 750 °C for 3 hours.', 'Milled, dried, ground, and granulated with a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) binder.', 'Pressed into discs with diameters of 12.5 mm and thicknesses of 1.0 mm at a pressure of 150 MPa.', 'Heated to 650 °C for 60 min to burn out the binder.', 'Sintered at 1080 °C for 3 h.', 'Polished to a thickness of approximately 0.5 mm.', 'Screen-printed silver paste onto the two parallel polished surfaces.', 'Fired at 570 °C for 30 min.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'FE-SEM', 'quasistatic d 33 meter', 'impedance analyzer', 'TF Analyzer 2000E']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
