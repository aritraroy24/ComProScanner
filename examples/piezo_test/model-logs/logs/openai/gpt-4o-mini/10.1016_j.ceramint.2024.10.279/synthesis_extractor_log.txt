Textured 0.96(K0.5Na0.5)(Nb0.96Sb0.04)O3-(0.04-x)CaZrO3-x(Bi0.5Ag0.5)ZrO3 (denoted as KNNS-(0.04-x)CZ-xBAZ, x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03) ceramics were fabricated by template grain growth (TGG) method. First, the KNNS-(0.04-x)CZ-xBAZ powders were prepared by the conventional high temperature solid state reaction method. High purity K2CO3, Na2CO3, Nb2O5, Sb2O3, CaCO3, ZrO2, Ag2O and Bi2O3 powders were weighted according to the stoichiometric ratio and mixed by ball-milling in anhydrous ethanol for 24 h and then calcined at 850 \xb0C for 5 h to form main perovskite structure. Second, the slurry was prepared by mixing the KNNS-(0.04-x)CZ-xBAZ matrix and NaNbO3 (NN) templates in ethanol/toluene co-solvent with polyvinyl butyral (PVB) binder and MnO2 sintering aid. Subsequently, the uniform slurry was tape casted to green tapes using a doctor blade with a thickness of 30\u201350 \u03bcm. After drying, the green tapes were cut, stacked, and uniaxially pressed under a pressure of 15 MPa at 70 \xb0C for 20 min. After removing organic binder at 600 \xb0C, the samples were heated to 1190 \xb0C, and then rapidly cooled to 1090 \xb0C and dwelled for 10 h. For comparative analysis, non-textured KNNS-(0.04-x)CZ-xBAZ (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03) ceramics were also synthesized by the same two step sintering process. The crystal structure and grain orientation of the ceramics were measured by X-ray diffractometer (XRD, TD-3700, Dandong Tongda Technology Co. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Carl Zeiss, Merlin Compact) combined with the electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) technique was employed to measure the microstructure and grain orientation. The domain structures were observed by using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Talos F200X, USA). The temperature-dependent dielectric permittivity (\u025br) was measured by a LCR meter (E4980A, Agilent Technologies, USA) in conjunction with a computer-controlled heating and cooling system. The polarization hysteresis (P-E) loops and electric-field-induced strain (S-E) curves were measured using a ferroelectric analysis system (TF Analyzer 2000, aix-ACCT, Germany), being connected with a laser interferometric vibrometer (SP-S 120/500, SIOS Mebtechnik GmbH, Germany). The d33 values were determined by a quasi-static d33 meter (ZJ-4, Institute of Acoustics, China) after the samples were poled at 20 kV/cm for 20 min. The longitudinal-mode electromechanical coupling factor (k33) was obtained by resonance-antiresonance method using a precision impedance analyzer (4294A, Agilent, USA). The KNNS-0.01CZ-0.03BAZ textured ceramics with the optimized electromechanical properties and the stainless steel shim were bonded together using conductive silver epoxy to prepare cantilever-structured PEHs. The mechanical vibration of PEH was generated using a shaker (JZK-5, Sinocera Piezotronics Inc., China) with an integrated power amplifier (YE5871A, Sinocera Piezotronics Inc., China). The vibration acceleration of cantilever beam was measured utilizing piezoelectric accelerometer (CA-YD-128, GST, USA). The output voltage and current of PEH were measured using a digital oscilloscope (SDS1102X-E, Siglent, China).

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The XRD pattern and SEM image of the NN templates particles used to texture KNNS-(0.04-x)CZ-xBAZ ceramics are shown in. It can be seen from (a), the NN templates present a single tetragonal perovskite structure without any trace of secondary phase. Obviously, only <00l>c diffraction peaks were observed in the NN templates, indicating the preferred crystal orientation along <00l>c direction. The SEM image ((b)) shows that the NN templates exhibit a plate-like morphology with a large aspect ratio of \u223c20. Thus, the NN templates can be easily aligned or oriented under the applied shear force during tape-casting. (a) provides the XRD patterns of KNNS-(0.04-x)CZ-xBAZ (x = 0\u20130.03) textured ceramics. Notably, all samples exhibit the dominant perovskite structure, and the x = 0.03 ceramics show the existence of secondary impurity phase as denoted by asterisk symbol, which can be identified as the ZrO2 (PDF #37-0031) phase. A combination of XRD studies and temperature-dependent dielectric permittivity measurements is proposed to determine the phase structure of the samples. (b) presents the temperature-dependent dielectric permittivity (\u03b5r-T) of the textured KNNS-(0.04-x)CZ-xBAZ ceramics. One can see the phase transition temperature of rhombohedral-orthorhombic (denoted as TR-O) is gradually increased, whereas that of the orthorhombic-tetragonal (refer to as TO-T) is monotonously decreased with the increase of x. Consequently, it can be deduced that the phase structure of the textured ceramics with x = 0 is O phase, and transforms into R and O phase coexistence for the textured ceramics with x = 0.01\u20130.02, and ultimately evolves into R, O and T multiphase coexistence when x = 0.03 at room temperature. Rietveld refinements of the XRD patterns of the x = 0\u20130.03 ceramics further confirmed the supposed phase structures are reliable due to the high matching degree (Rwp \u2264 6.32 %, Rp \u2264 4.15 %, and \u03c7E^{2} \u2264 4.32 for all samples) between the test and fitting results, as illustrated in (c). In addition, high relative intensity of (001)/(100) and (002)/(200) diffraction peaks as compared to other peaks ((a)) for all samples suggests the preferred <001> orientation of the grains. The texturing degree F001 was calculated in terms of Lotgering factor using the peak intensities and was found to have values of 83 %, 75 %, 92 % and 82 %, respectively, for the textured ceramics with x = 0\u20130.03. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) inverse pole figure (IPF) ( (a)) and <001> pole figure ((b)) measurements for the representative sample x = 0.03 further confirmed that most grains are well oriented along the <001> direction for the textured ceramic. SEM images of the cross-section of the textured ceramics shown in present that cubic-shaped grains are well aligned along the crystallographic <001> perpendicular to the tape casting direction, which is consistent with the results revealed by XRD measurement. In addition, needle-like pores (marked by the yellow dashed boxes) can be observed in all the textured ceramic, which can be attributed to the reaction of NaNbO3 seeds with the matrix and finally dissolved into the matrix of the ceramics during sintering. The relative densities determined by Archimedes method of all textured ceramics are larger than 93 % ( ), indicating a good densification. It is worth noting that the relative density of the textured ceramics increases with increasing doping content of (Bi0.5Ag0.5)ZrO3, which can be attributed to the sintering aid effect of (Bi0.5Ag0.5)ZrO3. (a) reveals the polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loops for the textured KNNS-(0.04-x)CZ-xBAZ ceramics obtained at the electric field and frequency of 40 kV/cm and 10 Hz, respectively. The coercive fields (Ec) of KNNS-(0.04-x)CZ-xBAZ textured ceramics had a similar magnitude of \u223c8.8 kV/cm, which is much lower than their random counterparts (>12 kV/cm), which is conducive to enhance the polarization degree, and thus achieving superior piezoelectric properties. Furthermore, the composition dependence of the ferroelectric properties is clearly visible, e.g., the Pr values initially increase and then descend with the increase of x, exhibiting a maximum value of approximately 23.4 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at x = 0.02, which may be interpreted in terms of the coexistence of R and O phases. To obtain the large signal piezoelectric coefficient d33\u2217, the unipolar electric-field-induced strains (Suni) were measured and presented in (c). It can be found that the strain values increase from 0.11 % at x = 0 to a maximum of 0.18 % at x = 0.03, corresponding a d33\u2217 (Smax/Emax) of 450 pm/V. The strain hysteresis is defined as \u0394S/Smax, where Smax is the strain at the maximum electric field (Emax) and \u0394S is the difference in the strain at Emax/2. It should be noted that an ultralow strain hysteresis of 5.7 % was observed in the KNNS-0.01CZ-0.03BAZ textured ceramic, which can be interpreted by the stable domain configuration of <001> oriented rhombohedral and orthorhombic crystals under the application of a [001] electric field. The piezoelectric coefficients (d33, g33), and longitudinal-mode coupling factor (k33) of KNNS-(0.04-x)CZ-xBAZ textured ceramics and their non-textured counterparts are given in (d) and (f), respectively. It is worth noting that excellent overall electromechanical-related properties of d33 \u223c 447 pC/N, g33 \u223c 30 \xd7 10E^{\u22123} Vm/N and k33 \u223c 47 % were achieved in the textured ceramics with x = 0.03. Of particular importance is that a large figure-of-merit (d33\xd7g33) value of 13.4 \xd7 10E^{\u221212} mE^{2}/N was detected in the textured ceramics with x = 0.03, which is beneficial to obtain large output power of PEHs. In respect to the textured ceramic with x = 0.03, the polycrystalline phase boundary with a R-O-T multiphase structure lowering the energy barrier to polarization rotation, which allows the ceramics to easily reach a saturated polarization under an external electric field, and thus enhance the piezoelectric response. Furthermore, the piezoelectric anisotropy resulted from the grain orientation along [001], and the favorable \u201c4R\u201d and \u201c4O\u201d engineered domain configurations which are formed by poling the rhombohedral and orthorhombic crystals along [001] direction should contribute to the high piezoelectric properties. In addition, to reveal the extrinsic contribution from the domain morphology viewpoint, we performed TEM measurement for the textured ceramic with x = 0.03. Due to the coexistence of R-O-T phases, complex domain morphology including stripe-like domains ( (a)) feature widths varying from 20 to 100 nm, and hierarchical domain architecture composing of needle-type nanodomains with widths of approximately 5\u201350 nm were clearly observed, as shown in (b). These two kinds of domains have low domain wall energy and almost vanishing polarization anisotropy as well as elastic softening, which can significantly improve the mobility of domain walls under the action of external electric field, and thus enhance the piezoelectric properties. (c) and (d) show the high-resolution lattice fringe diagram and the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the textured ceramic x = 0.03, exhibiting the ordered arrangement of atoms and the excellent crystalline quality. The crystal planes in (c) can be determined to be (010) and (001) through measuring the interplanar distance. It should be noted that the small signal piezoelectric coefficient d33 can be approximately extracted from the d33(E) loops at E = 0 other than the quasistatic testing. In order to evaluate the temperature stability of d33, the in-situ temperature-dependent d33(E) hysteresis loops were measured, and the results of a representative sample x = 0.03 are displayed in (a). Temperature-dependent d33 values for KNNS-(0.04-x)CZ-xBAZ textured ceramics are summarized in (b). It can be seen the d33 values of the textured ceramics (x = 0\u20130.02) rise significantly in the temperature range of 25 \xb0C - TO-T, and decrease slowly when the temperature exceeds TO-T. On the contrary, the d33 values of x = 0.03 textured ceramics decrease slightly in the temperature range of 25\u201340 \xb0C, and rise gradually in the range of 40\u2013120 \xb0C, where the fluctuation range of d33 is within 11.6 %, demonstrating good temperature stability. It is worth noting here that the x = 0.03 textured ceramic is found to maintain a comparatively large d33 of 511 pm/V up to 120 \xb0C. (c) shows the in-situ temperature dependence of unipolar strain curves for the sample x = 0.03 as an example. Temperature-dependent unipolar strain values for the textured ceramics x = 0\u20130.03 are depicted in (d). The values of Suni of x = 0.03 textured ceramic shows a relatively low deviation of 5.1 % with respect to its room temperature value in the range of 20\u2013120 \xb0C, suggesting extremely excellent temperature stability of strain. The good temperature stability of piezoelectric properties can be ascribed to the persistent contributions of crystal orientation to piezoelectric properties with elevated temperature, and the diffused phase transition between the R, O and T phases due to the disorder of the cations (KE^{+}, NaE^{+}, AgE^{+}, CaE^{2+}, BiE^{3+}) in the cell. To demonstrate practical applications of high-performance KNNS-0.01CZ-0.03BAZ textured ceramics, cantilever-type piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) was fabricated using KNNS-0.01CZ-0.03BAZ textured ceramics. The schematic diagram of the PEH, which consists mainly of a mechanical vibration control system, a steel bar adhering to a piezoelectric ceramic, and a circuit system of energy harvesting and AC-to-DC rectifying, are shown in (a). The output power and corresponding power density as a function of load resistance of PEH at a resonance frequency of 41 Hz and a fixed acceleration of 2g are given in (b). It can be observed that the output power increased at first and then decreased gradually with the increase of load resistance, as a result a maximum value of 0.46 mW was obtained at a load resistance of approximately 2.4 M\u03a9, which corresponding to a power density of 6.7 mW/cmE^{3}. It is clear that the power density of PEH made from KNNS-0.01CZ-0.03BAZ textured ceramic is better than most previously reported PEHs produced using other lead-free ceramics and even many PZT-based ceramics, as compared in (c) and. High power density of the PEH should be ascribed to the outstanding electromechanical conversion properties (d33 \u223c 447 pC/N, k33 \u223c 47 %) and large d33\xd7g33 (13.4 \xd7 10E^{\u221212} mE^{2}/N) values of the KNNS-0.01CZ-0.03BAZ textured ceramics. It is worth noting that 145 parallel-connected commercial light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which were arranged into the seven letters \u201cLCU SESM\u201d, were successfully lighted up using the output power of the PEH, as shown in (d). Therefore, this work clearly indicates the great potential of KNN-based textured ceramics for energy harvesting applications.

Temperature-dependent unipolar strain values for the textured ceramics x = 0\u20130.03 are depicted in (d). The values of Suni of x = 0.03 textured ceramic shows a relatively low deviation of 5.1 % with respect to its room temperature value in the range of 20\u2013120 \xb0C, suggesting extremely excellent temperature stability of strain. The good temperature stability of piezoelectric properties can be ascribed to the persistent contributions of crystal orientation to piezoelectric properties with elevated temperature, and the diffused phase transition between the R, O and T phases due to the disorder of the cations (KE^{+}, NaE^{+}, AgE^{+}, CaE^{2+}, BiE^{3+}) in the cell. To demonstrate practical applications of high-performance KNNS-0.01CZ-0.03BAZ textured ceramics, cantilever-type piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) was fabricated using KNNS-0.01CZ-0.03BAZ textured ceramics. The schematic diagram of the PEH, which consists mainly of a mechanical vibration control system, a steel bar adhering to a piezoelectric ceramic, and a circuit system of energy harvesting and AC-to-DC rectifying, are shown in (a). The output power and corresponding power density as a function of load resistance of PEH at a resonance frequency of 41 Hz and a fixed acceleration of 2g are given in (b). It can be observed that the output power increased at first and then decreased gradually with the increase of load resistance, as a result a maximum value of 0.46 mW was obtained at a load resistance of approximately 2.4 M\u03a9, which corresponding to a power density of 6.7 mW/cmE^{3}. It is clear that the power density of PEH made from KNNS-0.01CZ-0.03BAZ textured ceramic is better than most previously reported PEHs produced using other lead-free ceramics and even many PZT-based ceramics, as compared in (c) and. High power density of the PEH should be ascribed to the outstanding electromechanical conversion properties (d33 \u223c 447 pC/N, k33 \u223c 47 %) and large d33\xd7g33 (13.4 \xd7 10E^{\u221212} mE^{2}/N) values of the KNNS-0.01CZ-0.03BAZ textured ceramics. It is worth noting that 145 parallel-connected commercial light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which were arranged into the seven letters \u201cLCU SESM\u201d, were successfully lighted up using the output power of the PEH, as shown in (d). Therefore, this work clearly indicates the great potential of KNN-based textured ceramics for energy harvesting applications.
**Notes**:
- For precursors, just use the chemical name (no company or purity) and for characterization_techniques, only the instrument name or short name of the instrument for the instruments like XRD, Raman Spectroscopy, SEM, TEM etc.
