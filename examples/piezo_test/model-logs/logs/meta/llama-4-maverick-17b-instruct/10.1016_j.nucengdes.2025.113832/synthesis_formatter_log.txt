Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'Diffusion Bonding', 'precursors': ['PZT', 'Nickel', 'Silver'], 'steps': ['Coating PZT discs with silver using screen printing and firing at 800°C', 'Coating nickel wear plates with silver using DC sputtering and heating in flowing hydrogen gas at 700°C', 'Applying an additional silver coating on the nickel wear plate', 'Diffusion bonding of PZT discs to nickel wear plates at 275°C or 400°C under a pressure of 20 MPa for 1 hour', 'Thermal cycling of the bonded PZT discs between 250°C and room temperature'], 'characterization_techniques': ['Ultrasonic C-scan imaging', 'Piezometer System', 'Electrical conductivity measurement']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
