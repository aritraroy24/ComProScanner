BiFeO3 (BFO) powders preparation: The chemical reagents used in this work were all analytical grade reagents purchased from the Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. First of all, 0.011 mol Bi(NO3)3 and 0.01 mol Fe(NO3)3\xb79 H2O were weighed and dissolved into 100 mL of deionized water, respectively, to obtain an aqueous solution of 0.11 M bismuth nitrate and 0.1 M iron nitrate. Wherein the solvent of bismuth nitrate was added 3 mL of nitric acid (68 %) gradually during constant stirring until the bismuth nitrate was completely dissolved. Then the two solutions were mixed and 0.02 mol of triammonium citrate was added as the complexing agent and stirred for 30 min, and the gel of the reaction intermediate was obtained by continuous stirring at 90\u2103 until the water was completely evaporated. The gel was calcined at 550\u2103 for 2 h to obtain pure phase BFO powder particles. The preparation process of BFO samples is shown in a. CdS nanosheets preparation: After adding 10 mL of 0.3 M cadmium chloride solution to 50 mL of 0.1 M sodium citrate solution and stirring at room temperature for 20 min. Then, adding 3 mL of concentrated ammonia (NH3\xb7H2O 28 %) and 10 mL of 0.6 M thiourea solution in sequence. The mixed solution was then reacted in a water bath at 60 \u2103 for 2.5 h. After being cooled naturally, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation, rinsed several times with deionized water and anhydrous ethanol to remove impurities, and dried in an oven at 60 \u2103 to obtain CdS nanosheets. BFO/CdS samples preparation: 0.6 g of BFO was weighed into 60 mL of 0.1 M sodium citrate solution, and 1.38 mL of 0.3 M cadmium chloride solution was added according to 10 wt% of BFO, and stirred at room temperature for 3 h. Then 3.6 mL of concentrated ammonia (NH3\xb7H2O, 28 %) and 1.38 mL of 0.9 M thiourea solution were slowly added; the reaction was then carried out at 60 \u2103 in a water bath for 2.5 h. The precipitate was collected, and the precipitate was rinsed several times with deionised water and anhydrous ethanol, and dried in an oven at 60\u2103 to obtain 10 % CdS/BiFeO3 (BC10) samples. Cadmium chloride solution and thiourea solution could be further increased in stoichiometric ratios of the corresponding volume solutions to obtain 20 % CdS/BiFeO3 (BC20) and 30 % CdS/BiFeO3 (BC30). And the preparation process of BFO/CdS samples is displayed in c. The crystal structure and phase composition of the powders were determined using a Smart Lab X-ray diffraction (XRD) of Rigaku Corporation (Cu target, voltage: 40 kV, current: 40 mA, scanning range: 2\u03b8=20\u201380). The surface morphology of the samples was observed using a SU8020 scanning electron microscope (SEM) of Hitachi (HITACHI). Meanwhile, the electron migration direction and lattice spacing of the samples were determined by FEI Tecnai G2F30 S-Twin transmission electron microscope (TEM). The chemical compositions and states of the sample surfaces were analyzed using a Kratos\u2019 Axis Ultra X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS). The low-temperature adsorption-desorption curves of the powders under N2 atmosphere were tested using ASAP 2020 from Micromeritics and the specific surface area and pore structure of the samples were determined. The photoluminescence properties of the samples were analyzed using HORIBA's Fluorolog-QM steady-state transient fluorescence phosphorescence spectrometer (PTI) with a Xenon lamp source at 420 nm to characterize the separation and recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs as well as the defect concentration of the photocatalysts. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) was characterized by an electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer (Bruker ER075), which determines the state of the unpaired electrons by monitoring the absorption signals of the electrons associated with the magnetic field. UV-Vis absorption spectra were obtained by a Cary 5000 UV-Vis-nir spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies) to analyze the band gap and light absorption properties of the catalyst. The band gap of the sample was estimated according to the Tauc equation: \u03b1hv=A(hv-Eg)E^{n/2}, where \u03b1 is the absorption coefficient, h is the Planck's constant, v is the optical frequency, A is the proportionality constant and Eg is the bandgap of the sample (n is taken to be 1 for indirect bandgap semiconductors and 4 for direct bandgap semiconductors). Preparation of film samples for partial photoelectrochemical testing: 0.010 g of sample and 5 mL of rosinol were added to a centrifuge tube and the mixture was treated under ultrasound for 120 min to form a homogeneous suspension. 200 \u03bcL of the suspension was added dropwise to an area of 1.5 cmE^{2} (1.5 \xd71.0 cmE^{2}) on indium tin oxide (ITO) glass and stainless steel sheets and dried in an oven at 240\u2103. The suspension was then dried in an oven at 240\u2103. The BFO, BC10, BC20, BC30 and CdS films were then successfully prepared on ITO glass and stainless steel sheets, respectively. The photoelectric performance of the catalysts was carried out in a three-electrode system on a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation, with an FTO glass catalyst as the working electrode, a platinum plate as the counter electrode\uff0c and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. An external 300 W Xenon lamp was used as the light source. The electrolyte was 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution. Select ultrasonic wave source (100 W, 40 K Hz, GL0203\u201340, China) and Xenon lamp (300 W, CEL-HXF300, China) with the UV cutoff filter (\u03bb\u2265420 nm) to provide periodic mechanical load and simulated solar light source, respectively. In the test, 20 mg of catalyst powder samples were weighed and dissolved in 100 mL of 0.35 M Na2S/0.25 M Na2SO3 mixed sacrificial solution. Before the reaction, a vacuum pump was used to evacuate for 30 min to remove air from the reaction system. Then, during light source irradiation and/or ultrasonic treatment, analyze the hydrogen gas produced by photocatalytic water splitting using gas chromatography (GC-7920). Piezoelectric coefficient test: The upper and lower surfaces of different thin film samples on stainless steel sheets are coated with high-temperature silver paste using screen printing method, and the films are heated to 500 \u2103 at a rate of 3 \u2103/min for 2 hours with silver backing. After covering a layer of copper sheet, the YE2730A quasi-static d33 measuring instrument is used for d33 testing; Current voltage measurement (I-V): ITO glass was covered on the surface of a thin film sample and placed in the dark. During the measurement, a periodic force (10 N) was applied perpendicular to the thin film sample to compress the film. The I-V curve was recorded using a Keithley 2601 A digital source meter measuring device connected to two ITO layers.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The hexagonal BFO has a typical perovskite crystal structure, which not only has a typical piezoelectric response but also possesses a favorable photoresponse. The XRD pattern of BFO, ultrathin CdS nanosheets and BC10, BC20, BC30 composite samples prepared by the liquid-phase method as can be seen in a. The XRD patterns of composite samples presented characteristic diffraction peaks of BFO (JCPDS #72\u20132035) and CdS (JCPDF #89\u20132944). It is possible to find that the diffraction peaks of all BFO samples in both pristine samples and composite samples are sharp and intense, indicating that the prepared BFO catalysts are highly crystalline. Besides, no impurity phases such as Bi2O3 and Fe3O4 are generated. The BFO-containing samples generate the intensest characteristic peak at 32.1\xb0, which corresponds to the (110) crystal plane of the hexagonal crystal system for BFO. Meanwhile the CdS nanosheets prepared by liquid-phase precipitation method not only have a wider half-peak width at the same time (002) crystalline planes present at 26.5\xb0 are much more selectively oriented than the other crystalline planes, which may play a pivotal effect on the carrier transport rate of the composite samples. The XRD diffraction peaks of each sample did not show impurity peaks, indicating that the composite photocatalysts with different ratios have been successfully prepared and the two components are well compatible. The chemical composition and chemical state on the surface of each catalyst sample are then further characterised using XPS testing techniques to demonstrate the influence of the strong interaction between BFO and CdS and the construction of heterojunctions on electron transportation. The full spectra of BFO, CdS and BC20 composite catalysts are shown in (b), the elements Bi, Fe and O are present in BFO, the elements Cd and S are present in CdS, and BC20 samples contain all these five elements at the same time. The Bi 4 f peaks located at 158.4 eV and 163.7 eV in the XPS spectrum of BFO originate from Bi 4 f7/2 and Bi 4 f5/2, respectively , and these two binding energy peak positions are consistent with those of BFO in the full spectrum as shown in c. However, these two peak positions corresponding to BC20 are shifted to 159.3 eV and 164.6 eV, respectively. There are two characteristic peaks in the Fe 2p XPS pattern of BFO with binding energies of 724.1 eV and 710.7 eV, which originate from the binding energies of Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2, respectively. There is a satellite peak (\u223c717.3 eV) at 4.8 eV higher than the binding energy of Fe 2p3/2, which indicates that the Fe element in the material exists in the form of FeE^{3+} ions rather than FeE^{2+} ions. The binding energy of Fe element in the composite sample is shifted to higher energy levels by 3.2 eV similarly to that of the Bi element. It is noteworthy that the O 1 s characteristic peaks of BC20 composites correspond to lattice oxygen at low energy level, reactive oxygen at intermediate energy level and adsorbed oxygen at the high energy level, respectively. This indicates that the construction of heterojunction between BFO and CdS effectively enhanced the surface redox reaction ability of the catalyst. The high-resolution XPS spectra of Cd 3d of CdS and BC20 samples consist with two characteristic peaks of Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2 locate at 404.4 and 411.2 eV, respectively. The characteristic peaks of Cd 3d in the formed heterojunction composites are shifted to the lower energy level by 0.5 eV with a tendency to gain electrons. In contrast, the change in S 2p binding energy is not very pronounced, suggesting that the electron mobility in the heterojunction composites is more favorable from BFO to the metal cation around CdE^{2+}. The individual catalyst samples were characterised and analysed by SEM to investigate the size, morphology and contact method of the prepared samples. As can be seen in a, the synthesised BFO particles are distributed in the range of 100\u2013300 nm with the smooth surface of the material having spindle and ellipsoidal particle shapes. The SEM images of the BFO/CdS composite samples with CdS nanosheets gradually encapsulate on the surface of BFO particles are shown in c\u2013e. With the gradual increase in the mass fraction of CdS, BC20 is more fully distributed on the BFO surface due to the elevated percentage of nanoflowering CdS. The particulate BFO as a carrier of CdS enabled BC20 not only to have a higher contact area than BC10, but also inhibited the agglomeration of CdS, thus showing better dispersion. However, when the mass fraction of CdS is too high, the CdS nanosheets in the surface layer of BC30 have certain agglomeration phenomena and are no longer as unfolded as that of BC20, which may adversely affect the mass transfer of the reaction system. Subsequently, in order to demonstrate the successful preparation and dispersion of the composite BFO/CdS samples, EDS mapping of the elemental distribution in the BC20 samples was carried out. It can be seen that the distribution profiles of Bi and Fe elements are consistent with the sample morphology in f, which is due to the fact that the main structure of BC20 is composed of BFO. Further, the atomic percentage matches with the synthesised composite catalysts not only confirms the successful preparation of the samples in XRD, but also indicates the good dispersion of the samples. In order to investigate the morphology characteristics and composite patterns of the heterojunction composite catalysts, BC20 was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Besides, to investigate the electron flow between the two components, 1 wt% of Pt particles were loaded on the sample surface by photo deposition through H2PtCl6\xb76H2O precursor. a shows the obvious two-phase interface connection between the BFO of the bulk structure and the lamellar CdS. On the basis of HRTEM in b, it is observed that Pt microparticles are selectively deployed on the edge active sites of CdS nanosheets, which confirms that the electrons between the two components are transferred from BFO to CdS and reduced by the active sites of CdS. According to HRTEM b, it can be found that Pt nanoparticles are selectively deposited on the edge active sites of CdS nanosheets, which confirms that the electrons between the two components are transferred from BFO to CdS and reduced by the active sites of CdS. It is further found that the CdS nanosheets are preferentially oriented to the (002) lattice plane by d, which in agreement with the results in the XRD spectra. For the purpose of determining the effect of the introduction of non-homogeneous structured CdS nanosheets on the pore structure of the composites, N2 adsorption-desorption curves were employed to characterise the variation in the pore structure of the pristine BFO, CdS, and BFO/CdS composite photocatalysts with different mass ratios. The isothermal N2 adsorption-desorption curves of each catalyst are shown in a. All the samples exhibit Langmuir type IV isotherms except BFO crystals, which contain H3-type hysteresis lines. Based on the classification criteria of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) , which indicates that the material contains a high number of micropores in addition to mesopores. The pore size distribution in b also confirms this view, and when the mass fraction of CdS reaches 20 %, the porosity of the sample is not only much higher than that of the pristine BFO but also the highest among all composite samples. The reaction medium in solution is affected by the adsorption of high specific surface area CdS coating on the surface of BFO, which transforms the original free motion in three-dimensional space into restricted two-dimensional planar motion. Also noteworthy is the porosity of the BC30 sample is rather unsatisfactory with the agglomeration of CdS, which substantiates the observation of the phenomenon in the SEM. With the aim of investigating the photocatalytic performance of BFO/CdS heterojunction composites, the catalytic hydrogen evolution performance of catalysts with different composite ratios was tested and compared under visible-light irradiation in light-only, ultrasonic-only, and light coupled ultrasonic environments, respectively. Na2S/Na2SO3 mixed solution was used as the sacrificial agent. The amount of hydrogen production versus time and the rate of hydrogen production for pristine BFO, pristine CdS and BFO/CdS heterojunction composites with different mass ratios under the effect of light-only conditions are shown in a and b. The pristine BFO is limited by its excessive grain size that makes carriers transport in the bulk phase difficult, which in turn makes its hydrogen production performance unsatisfactory. Meanwhile, the pristine CdS phase accelerates the photogenerated carrier transport rate due to its thin-layer structure and high specific surface area, which not only benefits the adsorption of reactants and desorption of hydrogen, resulting in a hydrogen production rate of 0.54 mmol\xb7gE^{\u22121}\xb7hE^{\u22121} under visible light irradiation. The hydrogen production rates of all composites are higher than those of pristine BFO and CdS, with BC20 having a hydrogen evolution rate of 1.31 mmol\xb7gE^{\u22121}\xb7hE^{\u22121}, a factor of 42.81 higher than that of pristine BFO. This not only confirms that its photocatalytic performance is related to the specific surface area as well as the separation efficiency of its photogenerated electron-hole pairs, but also demonstrates that the construction of the heterojunction formed between BFO and CdS effectively accelerates the separation of photogenerated carriers. Moreover, the spindle and ellipsoidal particle structure of the pristine BFO leads to a much lower frequency and degree of deformation than that of CdS with a 2D lamellar structure, which results in a relatively low piezoelectric catalytic activity. In particular, the hydrogen production rate of 3.58 mmol\xb7gE^{\u22121}\xb7hE^{\u22121} can be achieved by BC20 under the effect of multi-field coupling. The reaction of multi-field coupled catalytic pure water splitting is relatively slow in the initial stage due to the limitation of the four-electron reaction at the oxidation end, while there is a significant increase after 2 h and the hydrogen production rate of BC20 can reach 0.19 mmol\xb7gE^{\u22121}\xb7hE^{\u22121}. Additionally, the composite morphology of CdS nanosheets loaded on the BFO surface has a rougher surface and richer pore structure. Since the stable perovskite crystal structure of BFO allows for good chemical stability, in turn, the easy photo-corrosive CdS was used for comparison with BC20. The Catalytic stability test of pristine CdS and BC20 under ultrasonic vibration and visible-light irradiation coupling conditions with sacrificial agent is shown in i. It can be found that BC20 has a good chemical stability, decaying only 10.1 % under 5 cycles of reaction. In contrast, the hydrogen production activity of pristine CdS decays by 31.7 % under 5 cycles, which is a significant decrease compared with BC20. The construction of Z-Scheme heterojunction can improve the stability of the composites by trapping photogenerated holes through BFO. As shown in j, the hydrogen production cycle stability of pure water splitting by pristine CdS decays to 68.8 % after 5 cycles due to the excessive accumulation of photogenerated cavities on the surface , which much lower than that under the reaction system containing sacrificial agent (31.7 %), suggesting that the utilisation of the Na2S/Na2SO3 sacrificial agent is able to lower the thermodynamic barrier to H2O splitting as well as reduce the degree of photocorrosion of the catalyst. The XRD of BC20 before and after the reaction under the conditions of pure water and sacrificial agent is shown in , the position of the diffraction peaks of BC20 did not change after the reaction, and the intensity of the peaks is slightly weakened, which indicates that its crystallinity has decreased. This is also the reason why the activity of BC20 decreased after 5 cycles, but the overall catalytic activity remained high. There is a strong synergistic effect between sulfur compound photocatalysts and OHE^{-} anions, and in the absence of hole sacrificers, OHE^{-} can also greatly contribute to the surface kinetics of hole release and water decomposition. The \xb7OH is the main product of the water oxidation half-reaction in the presence of OHE^{-}. The composite photocatalysts show the higher photocatalytic activity than the pristine single-phase catalysts, which can be attributed to the construction of BFO/CdS heterostructures and the good interfacial contact between them to improve the photogenerated carriers separation efficiency. The light absorption capacity of the pristine BFO, CdS and heterojunction composite catalysts can be seen by UV-Vis absorbance spectra in a. All of the samples have excellent visible light absorption capacity, and the composites all show stronger light absorption performance than the pristine BFO or CdS in the wavelength range higher than 390 nm. The bandgap of BFO and CdS were estimated to be 2.13 eV and 2.51 eV respectively based on UV-Vis absorbance spectra combined with the Tauc equation as can be seen in b. The band structure of the two component samples constituting the heterojunction was further clarified by the Mott-Schottky test and the frequency was set to 800 and 1000 Hz. The slope of the Mott-Schottky curve for BFO can be found to be negative through c , while it is positive for CdS in d. Therefore, the prepared BFO is a p-type semiconductor while CdS is an n-type semiconductor. The intersection of the different frequency linear parts of the Mott-Schottky diagram shows the flat band potential location, which corresponds to 1.42 and \u22121.26 eV vs Ag/AgCl for BFO and CdS, respectively. The flat band locations of the prepared BFO and CdS were transformed via the Nernst equation (E RHE = E Ag/AgCl + 0.059 \xd7 pH + E E^{ } Ag/AgCl ) to 2.02 eV and \u22120.66 eV for the standard hydrogen electrode potential. For the standard hydrogen electrode, the E VB for p-type semiconductors is very close to the flat band potential value, while the E CB for n-type semiconductors is very close to the flat band potential value. Therefore, the VB position of BFO is 2.02 eV and the CB position of CdS is \u22120.66 eV, and the corresponding conduction band or valence band positions can be deduced from E CB =E VB -E g. Toward investigating the impact of heterogeneous structure construction of BC20 composites on the degree of carrier recombination, the transfer of photogenerated carriers was probed by the photoluminescence properties (PL) and the results are shown in e. The PL peak intensities of BFO/CdS are all decreased to different degrees compared with those of the pristine samples, indicating that the successful fabrication of heterojunction can be effective to inhibit the internal recombination of photogenerated carriers in the composite samples. It is noteworthy that the emission peaks of the heterojunction composites are significantly shifted to higher wavelengths compared with those of the pure BFOs, suggesting that the bandgap and the surface states of the heterojunction composites are changed. In addition, the heterojunction between 2D materials and nanoparticles may lead to tighter contacts between layered CdS and BFO as well as more efficient separation of electron-hole pairs. The photocurrent density and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were performed to verify the charge transfer and electrochemical properties of the heterojunction composites. As shown in f and g, the highest photocurrent intensity possessed by BC20 further proves that it has the highest separation efficiency for photogenerated carriers. The charge transfer resistance of the heterojunction composite samples is significantly reduced compared with that of pristine BFO and CdS by comparing the electrochemical impedance spectra. BC20 corresponds to the smallest diameter of the semicircular arcs of the impedance spectra indicating that the fastest charge transfer rate is achieved. To more visually confirm whether this heterojunction follows a Z-scheme reaction route as well as to identify the reaction intermediate reactive species, it was investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance (ESR) spin trapping spectroscopy of DMPO-\xb7OH measured in aqueous suspensions of the BC20 composite samples and DMPO-\xb7O2 E^{-} measured in methanol suspensions. The characteristic peaks of \xb7OH and \xb7O2 E^{-} radicals were all detected in BC20 composite samples under xenon lamp irradiation. The CB position of CdS is more negative than the redox potential of O2/\xb7O2 E^{-} (-0.33 eV vs RHE ). Therefore, it can provide electrons to produce \xb7O2 E^{-}. However, the VB position of CdS is more negative than the oxidation potential of \xb7OH/OHE^{-} (1.90 eV vs. RHE ), which prevents it from oxidizing OHE^{-} to \xb7OH. On the contrary, in contrast, the VB and CB positions of BFO are more positive than \xb7OH/OHE^{-} and O2/\xb7O2 E^{-}, which ensures its ability to oxidize OHE^{-} to \xb7OH but without \xb7O2 E^{-}. Based on the above analysis, if the heterojunction of BFO/CdS is type-II, it is unable to produce \xb7OH or \xb7O2 E^{-} radicals. The Z-scheme heterojunction composed of BFO/CdS retains the more reducing CB of CdS and the more oxidizing VB of BFO are retained to obtain a more effective redox capacity. To further explore the piezoelectricity of the pristine BFO, pristine CdS and heterojunction composites more intuitively, the piezoelectric coefficient (d33), piezoelectric current and piezoelectric voltage of each sample are shown in. The piezoelectric coefficients d33 of pristine BFO, CdS and composite samples with different ratios were measured to be 17.04, 20.24, 26.48, 35.2 and 29.5 pC\xb7NE^{\u22121}, respectively, by the preparation of thin films for each sample. In the stressed state, the top and bottom surfaces of the catalyst films have different potentials and the potential difference was measured to be 0.15, 0.21, 0.32, 0.51, and 0.39 V for BFO, CdS and each of the heterojunction composites, respectively (b). The measured output currents are shown in c, with 0.031, 0.039, 0.056, 0.078 and 0.125 \xb5A for each catalyst sample under cyclic compression. It is evident that both BFO/CdS heterojunction composites exhibit higher piezoelectric generation performance than pristine BFO or CdS. As the center displacements of negative and positive ions (bound charges) in the single-phase crystal are lower than the Curie temperature, the spontaneous polarisation induced by external forces results in an internal electrostatic field within the BFO and CdS domains, which leads to the directional separation of free charges and photogenerated carriers in the catalysts with a piezoelectric response. In order to further investigate the electron transfer pathways between the two components of BFO/CdS composites with different energy bands interleaved, the work function of the samples was calculated using density flood theory (DFT). The formula is expressed as W= Evac-EF, where Evac denotes the vacuum energy level of the material and EF denotes the Fermi energy level of the material. As shown in a and b, the work functions of BFO and CdS are 2.67 and 4.65 eV, respectively, and thus the Fermi energy level of BFO is higher than that of CdS. When the two single-phase materials contact at the interface to form a heterojunction, the electrons will be transferred from BFO to CdS. At the same time, a internal electric field is formed from the surface of CdS to the surface of BFO. Until the Fermi energy level reaches the equilibrium value, the work function of the BFO/CdS composite is 4.23 eV, which results in the formation of a Z-scheme charge transfer pathway, as shown in c. The formation of Z-Scheme heterojunctions was confirmed by band structure testing and ESR spectroscopy, combined with the electron flow direction confirmed in TEM. The charge transfer schematic of the BFO/CdS heterojunction composite is shown in. Since the EF of CdS is higher than that of BFO, and thus when CdS is in contact with BFO, electrons spontaneously migrate from the CdS surface to the BFO surface, leading to a new EF equilibrium. On the contrary, due to the inflow of electrons, negative charges accumulate at the interface of the BFO, resulting in downward bending of the energy bands Meanwhile, the redistribution of charges at the CdS/BFO interface generates an inbuilt electric field, which facilitates the binding of electrons in the CB of the BFO and holes in the VB of the CdS. Under visible light irradiation, the electrons in the CB of BFO were driven by the internal electric field to complex with the holes in the VB of CdS. Since BFO and CdS are not only photocatalysts but also proved to have excellent piezoelectric response, there is both an interfacial electric field formed by the Z-Scheme heterojunction and a polarisation electric field between the two components. When light and external stress act simultaneously on single components of BFO or CdS catalysts, the piezoelectric potential as a strong driving force can promote the separation of photogenerated carriers from free charges within the bulk phase in piezoelectric photocatalysts. Consequently, the photogenerated electrons in the BFO CB are rapidly transferred through the contact interface, and furthermore, the hydrogen generation reaction is accelerated due to the enhancement of the ferroelectric polarisation of the CdS and the BFO which makes the CB of the CdS sufficiently charged with electrons.

BiFeO3 (BFO) powders preparation: The chemical reagents used in this work were all analytical grade reagents purchased from the Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. First of all, 0.011 mol Bi(NO3)3 and 0.01 mol Fe(NO3)3\xb79 H2O were weighed and dissolved into 100 mL of deionized water, respectively, to obtain an aqueous solution of 0.11 M bismuth nitrate and 0.1 M iron nitrate. Wherein the solvent of bismuth nitrate was added 3 mL of nitric acid (68 %) gradually during constant stirring until the bismuth nitrate was completely dissolved. Then the two solutions were mixed and 0.02 mol of triammonium citrate was added as the complexing agent and stirred for 30 min, and the gel of the reaction intermediate was obtained by continuous stirring at 90\u2103 until the water was completely evaporated. The gel was calcined at 550\u2103 for 2 h to obtain pure phase BFO powder particles. The preparation process of BFO samples is shown in a. CdS nanosheets preparation: After adding 10 mL of 0.3 M cadmium chloride solution to 50 mL of 0.1 M sodium citrate solution and stirring at room temperature for 20 min. Then, adding 3 mL of concentrated ammonia (NH3\xb7H2O 28 %) and 10 mL of 0.6 M thiourea solution in sequence. The mixed solution was then reacted in a water bath at 60 \u2103 for 2.5 h. After being cooled naturally, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation, rinsed several times with deionized water and anhydrous ethanol to remove impurities, and dried in an oven at 60 \u2103 to obtain CdS nanosheets. BFO/CdS samples preparation: 0.6 g of BFO was weighed into 60 mL of 0.1 M sodium citrate solution, and 1.38 mL of 0.3 M cadmium chloride solution was added according to 10 wt% of BFO, and stirred at room temperature for 3 h. Then 3.6 mL of concentrated ammonia (NH3\xb7H2O, 28 %) and 1.38 mL of 0.9 M thiourea solution were slowly added; the reaction was then carried out at 60 \u2103 in a water bath for 2.5 h. The precipitate was collected, and the precipitate was rinsed several times with deionised water and anhydrous ethanol, and dried in an oven at 60\u2103 to obtain 10 % CdS/BiFeO3 (BC10) samples. Cadmium chloride solution and thiourea solution could be further increased in stoichiometric ratios of the corresponding volume solutions to obtain 20 % CdS/BiFeO3 (BC20) and 30 % CdS/BiFeO3 (BC30). And the preparation process of BFO/CdS samples is displayed in c. The crystal structure and phase composition of the powders were determined using a Smart Lab X-ray diffraction (XRD) of Rigaku Corporation (Cu target, voltage: 40 kV, current: 40 mA, scanning range: 2\u03b8=20\u201380). The surface morphology of the samples was observed using a SU8020 scanning electron microscope (SEM) of Hitachi (HITACHI). Meanwhile, the electron migration direction and lattice spacing of the samples were determined by FEI Tecnai G2F30 S-Twin transmission electron microscope (TEM). The chemical compositions and states of the sample surfaces were analyzed using a Kratos\u2019 Axis Ultra X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS). The low-temperature adsorption-desorption curves of the powders under N2 atmosphere were tested using ASAP 2020 from Micromeritics and the specific surface area and pore structure of the samples were determined. The photoluminescence properties of the samples were analyzed using HORIBA's Fluorolog-QM steady-state transient fluorescence phosphorescence spectrometer (PTI) with a Xenon lamp source at 420 nm to characterize the separation and recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs as well as the defect concentration of the photocatalysts. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) was characterized by an electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer (Bruker ER075), which determines the state of the unpaired electrons by monitoring the absorption signals of the electrons associated with the magnetic field. UV-Vis absorption spectra were obtained by a Cary 5000 UV-Vis-nir spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies) to analyze the band gap and light absorption properties of the catalyst. The band gap of the sample was estimated according to the Tauc equation: \u03b1hv=A(hv-Eg)E^{n/2}, where \u03b1 is the absorption coefficient, h is the Planck's constant, v is the optical frequency, A is the proportionality constant and Eg is the bandgap of the sample (n is taken to be 1 for indirect bandgap semiconductors and 4 for direct bandgap semiconductors). Preparation of film samples for partial photoelectrochemical testing: 0.010 g of sample and 5 mL of rosinol were added to a centrifuge tube and the mixture was treated under ultrasound for 120 min to form a homogeneous suspension. 200 \u03bcL of the suspension was added dropwise to an area of 1.5 cmE^{2} (1.5 \xd71.0 cmE^{2}) on indium tin oxide (ITO) glass and stainless steel sheets and dried in an oven at 240\u2103. The suspension was then dried in an oven at 240\u2103. The BFO, BC10, BC20, BC30 and CdS films were then successfully prepared on ITO glass and stainless steel sheets, respectively. The photoelectric performance of the catalysts was carried out in a three-electrode system on a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation, with an FTO glass catalyst as the working electrode, a platinum plate as the counter electrode\uff0c and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. An external 300 W Xenon lamp was used as the light source. The electrolyte was 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution. Select ultrasonic wave source (100 W, 40 K Hz, GL0203\u201340, China) and Xenon lamp (300 W, CEL-HXF300, China) with the UV cutoff filter (\u03bb\u2265420 nm) to provide periodic mechanical load and simulated solar light source, respectively. In the test, 20 mg of catalyst powder samples were weighed and dissolved in 100 mL of 0.35 M Na2S/0.25 M Na2SO3 mixed sacrificial solution. Before the reaction, a vacuum pump was used to evacuate for 30 min to remove air from the reaction system. Then, during light source irradiation and/or ultrasonic treatment, analyze the hydrogen gas produced by photocatalytic water splitting using gas chromatography (GC-7920). Piezoelectric coefficient test: The upper and lower surfaces of different thin film samples on stainless steel sheets are coated with high-temperature silver paste using screen printing method, and the films are heated to 500 \u2103 at a rate of 3 \u2103/min for 2 hours with silver backing. After covering a layer of copper sheet, the YE2730A quasi-static d33 measuring instrument is used for d33 testing; Current voltage measurement (I-V): ITO glass was covered on the surface of a thin film sample and placed in the dark. During the measurement, a periodic force (10 N) was applied perpendicular to the thin film sample to compress the film. The I-V curve was recorded using a Keithley 2601 A digital source meter measuring device connected to two ITO layers.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The hexagonal BFO has a typical perovskite crystal structure, which not only has a typical piezoelectric response but also possesses a favorable photoresponse. The XRD pattern of BFO, ultrathin CdS nanosheets and BC10, BC20, BC30 composite samples prepared by the liquid-phase method as can be seen in a. The XRD patterns of composite samples presented characteristic diffraction peaks of BFO (JCPDS #72\u20132035) and CdS (JCPDF #89\u20132944). It is possible to find that the diffraction peaks of all BFO samples in both pristine samples and composite samples are sharp and intense, indicating that the prepared BFO catalysts are highly crystalline. Besides, no impurity phases such as Bi2O3 and Fe3O4 are generated. The BFO-containing samples generate the intensest characteristic peak at 32.1\xb0, which corresponds to the (110) crystal plane of the hexagonal crystal system for BFO. Meanwhile the CdS nanosheets prepared by liquid-phase precipitation method not only have a wider half-peak width at the same time (002) crystalline planes present at 26.5\xb0 are much more selectively oriented than the other crystalline planes, which may play a pivotal effect on the carrier transport rate of the composite samples. The XRD diffraction peaks of each sample did not show impurity peaks, indicating that the composite photocatalysts with different ratios have been successfully prepared and the two components are well compatible. The chemical composition and chemical state on the surface of each catalyst sample are then further characterised using XPS testing techniques to demonstrate the influence of the strong interaction between BFO and CdS and the construction of heterojunctions on electron transportation. The full spectra of BFO, CdS and BC20 composite catalysts are shown in (b), the elements Bi, Fe and O are present in BFO, the elements Cd and S are present in CdS, and BC20 samples contain all these five elements at the same time. The Bi 4 f peaks located at 158.4 eV and 163.7 eV in the XPS spectrum of BFO originate from Bi 4 f7/2 and Bi 4 f5/2, respectively , and these two binding energy peak positions are consistent with those of BFO in the full spectrum as shown in c. However, these two peak positions corresponding to BC20 are shifted to 159.3 eV and 164.6 eV, respectively. There are two characteristic peaks in the Fe 2p XPS pattern of BFO with binding energies of 724.1 eV and 710.7 eV, which originate from the binding energies of Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2, respectively. There is a satellite peak (\u223c717.3 eV) at 4.8 eV higher than the binding energy of Fe 2p3/2, which indicates that the Fe element in the material exists in the form of FeE^{3+} ions rather than FeE^{2+} ions. The binding energy of Fe element in the composite sample is shifted to higher energy levels by 3.2 eV similarly to that of the Bi element. It is noteworthy that the O 1 s characteristic peaks of BC20 composites correspond to lattice oxygen at low energy level, reactive oxygen at intermediate energy level and adsorbed oxygen at the high energy level, respectively. This indicates that the construction of heterojunction between BFO and CdS effectively enhanced the surface redox reaction ability of the catalyst. The high-resolution XPS spectra of Cd 3d of CdS and BC20 samples consist with two characteristic peaks of Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2 locate at 404.4 and 411.2 eV, respectively. The characteristic peaks of Cd 3d in the formed heterojunction composites are shifted to the lower energy level by 0.5 eV with a tendency to gain electrons. In contrast, the change in S 2p binding energy is not very pronounced, suggesting that the electron mobility in the heterojunction composites is more favorable from BFO to the metal cation around CdE^{2+}. The individual catalyst samples were characterised and analysed by SEM to investigate the size, morphology and contact method of the prepared samples. As can be seen in a, the synthesised BFO particles are distributed in the range of 100\u2013300 nm with the smooth surface of the material having spindle and ellipsoidal particle shapes. The SEM images of the BFO/CdS composite samples with CdS nanosheets gradually encapsulate on the surface of BFO particles are shown in c\u2013e. With the gradual increase in the mass fraction of CdS, BC20 is more fully distributed on the BFO surface due to the elevated percentage of nanoflowering CdS. The particulate BFO as a carrier of CdS enabled BC20 not only to have a higher contact area than BC10, but also inhibited the agglomeration of CdS, thus showing better dispersion. However, when the mass fraction of CdS is too high, the CdS nanosheets in the surface layer of BC30 have certain agglomeration phenomena and are no longer as unfolded as that of BC20, which may adversely affect the mass transfer of the reaction system. Subsequently, in order to demonstrate the successful preparation and dispersion of the composite BFO/CdS samples, EDS mapping of the elemental distribution in the BC20 samples was carried out. It can be seen that the distribution profiles of Bi and Fe elements are consistent with the sample morphology in f, which is due to the fact that the main structure of BC20 is composed of BFO. Further, the atomic percentage matches with the synthesised composite catalysts not only confirms the successful preparation of the samples in XRD, but also indicates the good dispersion of the samples. In order to investigate the morphology characteristics and composite patterns of the heterojunction composite catalysts, BC20 was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Besides, to investigate the electron flow between the two components, 1 wt% of Pt particles were loaded on the sample surface by photo deposition through H2PtCl6\xb76H2O precursor. a shows the obvious two-phase interface connection between the BFO of the bulk structure and the lamellar CdS. On the basis of HRTEM in b, it is observed that Pt microparticles are selectively deployed on the edge active sites of CdS nanosheets, which confirms that the electrons between the two components are transferred from BFO to CdS and reduced by the active sites of CdS. According to HRTEM b, it can be found that Pt nanoparticles are selectively deposited on the edge active sites of CdS nanosheets, which confirms that the electrons between the two components are transferred from BFO to CdS and reduced by the active sites of CdS. It is further found that the CdS nanosheets are preferentially oriented to the (002) lattice plane by d, which in agreement with the results in the XRD spectra. For the purpose of determining the effect of the introduction of non-homogeneous structured CdS nanosheets on the pore structure of the composites, N2 adsorption-desorption curves were employed to characterise the variation in the pore structure of the pristine BFO, CdS, and BFO/CdS composite photocatalysts with different mass ratios. The isothermal N2 adsorption-desorption curves of each catalyst are shown in a. All the samples exhibit Langmuir type IV isotherms except BFO crystals, which contain H3-type hysteresis lines. Based on the classification criteria of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) , which indicates that the material contains a high number of micropores in addition to mesopores. The pore size distribution in b also confirms this view, and when the mass fraction of CdS reaches 20 %, the porosity of the sample is not only much higher than that of the pristine BFO but also the highest among all composite samples. The reaction medium in solution is affected by the adsorption of high specific surface area CdS coating on the surface of BFO, which transforms the original free motion in three-dimensional space into restricted two-dimensional planar motion. Also noteworthy is the porosity of the BC30 sample is rather unsatisfactory with the agglomeration of CdS, which substantiates the observation of the phenomenon in the SEM. With the aim of investigating the photocatalytic performance of BFO/CdS heterojunction composites, the catalytic hydrogen evolution performance of catalysts with different composite ratios was tested and compared under visible-light irradiation in light-only, ultrasonic-only, and light coupled ultrasonic environments, respectively. Na2S/Na2SO3 mixed solution was used as the sacrificial agent. The amount of hydrogen production versus time and the rate of hydrogen production for pristine BFO, pristine CdS and BFO/CdS heterojunction composites with different mass ratios under the effect of light-only conditions are shown in a and b. The pristine BFO is limited by its excessive grain size that makes carriers transport in the bulk phase difficult, which in turn makes its hydrogen production performance unsatisfactory. Meanwhile, the pristine CdS phase accelerates the photogenerated carrier transport rate due to its thin-layer structure and high specific surface area, which not only benefits the adsorption of reactants and desorption of hydrogen, resulting in a hydrogen production rate of 0.54 mmol\xb7gE^{\u22121}\xb7hE^{\u22121} under visible light irradiation. The hydrogen production rates of all composites are higher than those of pristine BFO and CdS, with BC20 having a hydrogen evolution rate of 1.31 mmol\xb7gE^{\u22121}\xb7hE^{\u22121}, a factor of 42.81 higher than that of pristine BFO. This not only confirms that its photocatalytic performance is related to the specific surface area as well as the separation efficiency of its photogenerated electron-hole pairs, but also demonstrates that the construction of the heterojunction formed between BFO and CdS effectively accelerates the separation of photogenerated carriers. Moreover, the spindle and ellipsoidal particle structure of the pristine BFO leads to a much lower frequency and degree of deformation than that of CdS with a 2D lamellar structure, which results in a relatively low piezoelectric catalytic activity. In particular, the hydrogen production rate of 3.58 mmol\xb7gE^{\u22121}\xb7hE^{\u22121} can be achieved by BC20 under the effect of multi-field coupling. The reaction of multi-field coupled catalytic pure water splitting is relatively slow in the initial stage due to the limitation of the four-electron reaction at the oxidation end, while there is a significant increase after 2 h and the hydrogen production rate of BC20 can reach 0.19 mmol\xb7gE^{\u22121}\xb7hE^{\u22121}. Additionally, the composite morphology of CdS nanosheets loaded on the BFO surface has a rougher surface and richer pore structure. Since the stable perovskite crystal structure of BFO allows for good chemical stability, in turn, the easy photo-corrosive CdS was used for comparison with BC20. The Catalytic stability test of pristine CdS and BC20 under ultrasonic vibration and visible-light irradiation coupling conditions with sacrificial agent is shown in i. It can be found that BC20 has a good chemical stability, decaying only 10.1 % under 5 cycles of reaction. In contrast, the hydrogen production activity of pristine CdS decays by 31.7 % under 5 cycles, which is a significant decrease compared with BC20. The construction of Z-Scheme heterojunction can improve the stability of the composites by trapping photogenerated holes through BFO. As shown in j, the hydrogen production cycle stability of pure water splitting by pristine CdS decays to 68.8 % after 5 cycles due to the excessive accumulation of photogenerated cavities on the surface , which much lower than that under the reaction system containing sacrificial agent (31.7 %), suggesting that the utilisation of the Na2S/Na2SO3 sacrificial agent is able to lower the thermodynamic barrier to H2O splitting as well as reduce the degree of photocorrosion of the catalyst. The XRD of BC20 before and after the reaction under the conditions of pure water and sacrificial agent is shown in , the position of the diffraction peaks of BC20 did not change after the reaction, and the intensity of the peaks is slightly weakened, which indicates that its crystallinity has decreased. This is also the reason why the activity of BC20 decreased after 5 cycles, but the overall catalytic activity remained high. There is a strong synergistic effect between sulfur compound photocatalysts and OHE^{-} anions, and in the absence of hole sacrificers, OHE^{-} can also greatly contribute to the surface kinetics of hole release and water decomposition. The \xb7OH is the main product of the water oxidation half-reaction in the presence of OHE^{-}. The composite photocatalysts show the higher photocatalytic activity than the pristine single-phase catalysts, which can be attributed to the construction of BFO/CdS heterostructures and the good interfacial contact between them to improve the photogenerated carriers separation efficiency. The light absorption capacity of the pristine BFO, CdS and heterojunction composite catalysts can be seen by UV-Vis absorbance spectra in a. All of the samples have excellent visible light absorption capacity, and the composites all show stronger light absorption performance than the pristine BFO or CdS in the wavelength range higher than 390 nm. The bandgap of BFO and CdS were estimated to be 2.13 eV and 2.51 eV respectively based on UV-Vis absorbance spectra combined with the Tauc equation as can be seen in b. The band structure of the two component samples constituting the heterojunction was further clarified by the Mott-Schottky test and the frequency was set to 800 and 1000 Hz. The slope of the Mott-Schottky curve for BFO can be found to be negative through c , while it is positive for CdS in d. Therefore, the prepared BFO is a p-type semiconductor while CdS is an n-type semiconductor. The intersection of the different frequency linear parts of the Mott-Schottky diagram shows the flat band potential location, which corresponds to 1.42 and \u22121.26 eV vs Ag/AgCl for BFO and CdS, respectively. The flat band locations of the prepared BFO and CdS were transformed via the Nernst equation (E RHE = E Ag/AgCl + 0.059 \xd7 pH + E E^{ } Ag/AgCl ) to 2.02 eV and \u22120.66 eV for the standard hydrogen electrode potential. For the standard hydrogen electrode, the E VB for p-type semiconductors is very close to the flat band potential value, while the E CB for n-type semiconductors is very close to the flat band potential value. Therefore, the VB position of BFO is 2.02 eV and the CB position of CdS is \u22120.66 eV, and the corresponding conduction band or valence band positions can be deduced from E CB =E VB -E g. Toward investigating the impact of heterogeneous structure construction of BC20 composites on the degree of carrier recombination, the transfer of photogenerated carriers was probed by the photoluminescence properties (PL) and the results are shown in e. The PL peak intensities of BFO/CdS are all decreased to different degrees compared with those of the pristine samples, indicating that the successful fabrication of heterojunction can be effective to inhibit the internal recombination of photogenerated carriers in the composite samples. It is noteworthy that the emission peaks of the heterojunction composites are significantly shifted to higher wavelengths compared with those of the pure BFOs, suggesting that the bandgap and the surface states of the heterojunction composites are changed. In addition, the heterojunction between 2D materials and nanoparticles may lead to tighter contacts between layered CdS and BFO as well as more efficient separation of electron-hole pairs. The photocurrent density and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were performed to verify the charge transfer and electrochemical properties of the heterojunction composites. As shown in f and g, the highest photocurrent intensity possessed by BC20 further proves that it has the highest separation efficiency for photogenerated carriers. The charge transfer resistance of the heterojunction composite samples is significantly reduced compared with that of pristine BFO and CdS by comparing the electrochemical impedance spectra. BC20 corresponds to the smallest diameter of the semicircular arcs of the impedance spectra indicating that the fastest charge transfer rate is achieved. To more visually confirm whether this heterojunction follows a Z-scheme reaction route as well as to identify the reaction intermediate reactive species, it was investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance (ESR) spin trapping spectroscopy of DMPO-\xb7OH measured in aqueous suspensions of the BC20 composite samples and DMPO-\xb7O2 E^{-} measured in methanol suspensions. The characteristic peaks of \xb7OH and \xb7O2 E^{-} radicals were all detected in BC20 composite samples under xenon lamp irradiation. The CB position of CdS is more negative than the redox potential of O2/\xb7O2 E^{-} (-0.33 eV vs RHE ). Therefore, it can provide electrons to produce \xb7O2 E^{-}. However, the VB position of CdS is more negative than the oxidation potential of \xb7OH/OHE^{-} (1.90 eV vs. RHE ), which prevents it from oxidizing OHE^{-} to \xb7OH. On the contrary, in contrast, the VB and CB positions of BFO are more positive than \xb7OH/OHE^{-} and O2/\xb7O2 E^{-}, which ensures its ability to oxidize OHE^{-} to \xb7OH but without \xb7O2 E^{-}. Based on the above analysis, if the heterojunction of BFO/CdS is type-II, it is unable to produce \xb7OH or \xb7O2 E^{-} radicals. The Z-scheme heterojunction composed of BFO/CdS retains the more reducing CB of CdS and the more oxidizing VB of BFO are retained to obtain a more effective redox capacity. To further explore the piezoelectricity of the pristine BFO, pristine CdS and heterojunction composites more intuitively, the piezoelectric coefficient (d33), piezoelectric current and piezoelectric voltage of each sample are shown in. The piezoelectric coefficients d33 of pristine BFO, CdS and composite samples with different ratios were measured to be 17.04, 20.24, 26.48, 35.2 and 29.5 pC\xb7NE^{\u22121}, respectively, by the preparation of thin films for each sample. In the stressed state, the top and bottom surfaces of the catalyst films have different potentials and the potential difference was measured to be 0.15, 0.21, 0.32, 0.51, and 0.39 V for BFO, CdS and each of the heterojunction composites, respectively (b). The measured output currents are shown in c, with 0.031, 0.039, 0.056, 0.078 and 0.125 \xb5A for each catalyst sample under cyclic compression. It is evident that both BFO/CdS heterojunction composites exhibit higher piezoelectric generation performance than pristine BFO or CdS. As the center displacements of negative and positive ions (bound charges) in the single-phase crystal are lower than the Curie temperature, the spontaneous polarisation induced by external forces results in an internal electrostatic field within the BFO and CdS domains, which leads to the directional separation of free charges and photogenerated carriers in the catalysts with a piezoelectric response. In order to further investigate the electron transfer pathways between the two components of BFO/CdS composites with different energy bands interleaved, the work function of the samples was calculated using density flood theory (DFT). The formula is expressed as W= Evac-EF, where Evac denotes the vacuum energy level of the material and EF denotes the Fermi energy level of the material. As shown in a and b, the work functions of BFO and CdS are 2.67 and 4.65 eV, respectively, and thus the Fermi energy level of BFO is higher than that of CdS. When the two single-phase materials contact at the interface to form a heterojunction, the electrons will be transferred from BFO to CdS. At the same time, a internal electric field is formed from the surface of CdS to the surface of BFO. Until the Fermi energy level reaches the equilibrium value, the work function of the BFO/CdS composite is 4.23 eV, which results in the formation of a Z-scheme charge transfer pathway, as shown in c. The formation of Z-Scheme heterojunctions was confirmed by band structure testing and ESR spectroscopy, combined with the electron flow direction confirmed in TEM. The charge transfer schematic of the BFO/CdS heterojunction composite is shown in. Since the EF of CdS is higher than that of BFO, and thus when CdS is in contact with BFO, electrons spontaneously migrate from the CdS surface to the BFO surface, leading to a new EF equilibrium. On the contrary, due to the inflow of electrons, negative charges accumulate at the interface of the BFO, resulting in downward bending of the energy bands Meanwhile, the redistribution of charges at the CdS/BFO interface generates an inbuilt electric field, which facilitates the binding of electrons in the CB of the BFO and holes in the VB of the CdS. Under visible light irradiation, the electrons in the CB of BFO were driven by the internal electric field to complex with the holes in the VB of CdS. Since BFO and CdS are not only photocatalysts but also proved to have excellent piezoelectric response, there is both an interfacial electric field formed by the Z-Scheme heterojunction and a polarisation electric field between the two components. When light and external stress act simultaneously on single components of BFO or CdS catalysts, the piezoelectric potential as a strong driving force can promote the separation of photogenerated carriers from free charges within the bulk phase in piezoelectric photocatalysts. Consequently, the photogenerated electrons in the BFO CB are rapidly transferred through the contact interface, and furthermore, the hydrogen generation reaction is accelerated due to the enhancement of the ferroelectric polarisation of the CdS and the BFO which makes the CB of the CdS sufficiently charged with electrons.
