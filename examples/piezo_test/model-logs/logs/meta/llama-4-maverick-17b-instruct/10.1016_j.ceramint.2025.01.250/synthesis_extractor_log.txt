Ca1\u2212x (Na0.5Pr0.25Ce0.25) x Bi4Ti4O15 + 0.2 wt% MnO2 (CNPCBTM-x, x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20) ceramics were synthesised via the solid-state reaction method. The raw materials were powders of CaCO3 (99 %), Na2CO3 (99.8 %), Pr6O11 (99.9 %), CeO2 (99.99 %), Bi2O3 (99.9 %) and TiO2 (99.99 %). The powders were ground using a planetary ball mill for 12 h, and anhydrous ethanol was used as the solvent. The ball-milling mixture was dried at 70 \xb0C for 6 h. The dried powders were calcined for 4 h at 850 \xb0C, after which 0.2 wt% MnO2 was added to the calcined powders. The calcined powders were ground using the planetary ball mill for 12 h and dried again. A 6 wt% polyvinyl alcohol binder (PVA) was added to the calcined powders, and the powders were pressed into discs under a pressure of 6\u20138 MPa. Subsequently, the discs were heated at 600 \xb0C for 2 h to remove the PVA. The pellets were sintered at 950 \xb0C-1050 \xb0C for 2.5 h in the air.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The XRD patterns of the CNPCBTM-x ceramics over a 2\u03b8 range of 20\xb0\u201360\xb0 are shown in (a). The XRD patterns of all the samples correspond well with the PDF#52\u20131640 (CBT) card, suggesting that the doped ions have completely dissolved into the lattice and there is no secondary phase in all the samples. The diffraction peak with the highest intensity represents the (119) plane, which is consistent with the characteristic peak of BLSFs with m = 4. Moreover, the partially detailed patterns in the range of 2\u03b8 = 30\xb0\u201331\xb0 are shown in (b). Results reveal that the diffraction peak of the (119) plane shifts to a lower angle with increasing levels of Na/Pr/Ce co-doping, indicating an expansion of the lattices, which is caused by the substitution of doping ions with different radii at the A-site. The A-site in the pseudo-perovskite layer of CBT is occupied by CaE^{2+} and BiE^{3+}. By the molar ratio of the occupying atoms, it can be found that the average ionic radii of NaE^{+} (1.39 \xc5, CN = 12), PrE^{3+} (1.14 \xc5, CN = 12) and CeE^{3+} (1.34 \xc5, CN = 12) is larger than that of CaE^{2+} (1.34 \xc5, CN = 12) and BiE^{3+} (1.17 \xc5, CN = 12). The surface SEM images of the CNPCBTM-x ceramics after thermal etching are given in (a)\u2013(e), with the insets showing the grain size distributions. Images show that the grains of all samples are platelike, which is due to the preferred orientation of growth along the a\u2013b plane for CBT ceramics. The average grain size (length) of all samples is in the range of 1.8\u20132.1 \u03bcm, which is smaller than that of Na/Ce co-doped CBT ceramics reported by Hu et al.. For the platelike grains of CBT ceramics, the smaller grain size (length) can apparently reduce the gap caused by the cross-distribution of grains. In addition, the average grain size decreases with the increase in the doping level, suggesting that the preferred orientation of grains along the a\u2013b plane weakens. The direction of spontaneous polarization of CBT ceramics is limited to the a\u2013b plane; hence, the weakening of this preferred orientation is favourable for the enhancement of spontaneous polarization, which may enhance piezoelectric properties. The decrease in grain size can be well explained by the lattice strain energy (\u0394Gstrain) theory. NaE^{+}, PrE^{3+} and CeE^{3+} replace cation at the A-site, increasing lattice strain energy, which inhibits grain boundary migration and blocks the growth of the platelike grain along the (001) plane. shows the mapping images of the CNPCBTM-0.10 ceramic. Images showed that O, Na, Ca, Ti, Mn, Bi, Ce, and Pr are evenly distributed in the sample, suggesting that all doping ions have dissolved into the CBT lattice and formed a solid solution, consistent with the results of XRD. The T C and dielectric loss at high temperatures are closely related to the application of high-temperature piezoceramics. (a) shows the temperature dependence of the relative dielectric constant for the CNPCBTM-x ceramics, and the inset is T C of the CNPCBTM-x ceramics. The T C of the ceramics decreases from 813 \xb0C to 795 \xb0C with the increase of the doping level, and the T C of all samples is higher than that of pure CBT ceramics (\u223c790 \xb0C). The tolerance factor (t) can be expressed as t= ( RA+ RO)/ 2 ( RB+ RO), where RA, RB and RO represent the ion radius of the A-site cation, B-site cation and oxygen ion, respectively. According to Li et al., Mn ions show different valence states at different sintering temperatures: MnE^{2+} only exists at higher sintering temperatures (>1200 \xb0C), and MnE^{3+} exists at a sintering temperature of approximately 1000 \xb0C. MnE^{4+} is obtained by oxidation of MnE^{2+} and MnE^{3+} in the cooling process of sintering. However, the presence of MnE^{4+} is difficult to observe in ceramics because oxygen in the air is difficult to diffuse into the ceramics due to the dense structure of it during the sintering process. Thus, MnE^{3+} is the main form at the sintering temperature of this study. A large amount of MnE^{3+} (0.70 \xc5, CN = 6) substitutes for TiE^{4+} (0.605 \xc5, CN = 6) at the B-site of the pseudo-perovskite layer, and a small amount of MnE^{3+} occupies the A-site, which decreases the tolerance factor. Therefore, the T C of all doped samples is higher than that of pure CBT. XRD results in indicate that NaE^{+}, PrE^{3+} and CeE^{3+} with larger ionic radii occupy the A-site, which increases the tolerance factor. In summary, the T C of all samples is at a higher value due to the addition of a fixed content of MnO2 and the decrease in T C for different samples due to additional doping of Na/Pr/Ce. In addition, there are dielectric relaxation peaks near 600 \xb0C for ceramics with x = 0.15 and 0.20 (as shown in the orange circle), which are believed to be related to the relaxation time of the electric dipole caused by the defect. The appearance of dielectric relaxation peaks indicates that a higher doping level changes the state of the defect. (b) shows the temperature dependence of the dielectric loss for the CNPCBTM-x ceramics, with the inset being a partial magnification near 400 \xb0C. The dielectric loss of ceramics with x = 0, 0.05 and 0.10 at 400 \xb0C is lower than that of pure CBT (\u223c0.03) reported by Liu et al., and it is far lower than the dielectric loss of Mn doped CBT ceramics reported by Zhao et al.. However, there is increased dielectric loss for ceramics with x = 0.15 and 0.20, which indicates that the doping is excessive. Oxygen vacancy is thought to be the main cause of increased dielectric loss for BLSF ceramics. The low dielectric loss is advantageous for the application of CBT-based ceramics in high-temperature conditions. As shown in (b), ceramics with higher doping levels (x = 0.15 and 0.20) show lower dielectric loss above 600 \xb0C, which may be attributed to the uniform charge distribution caused by the diffusion of oxygen vacancy at high temperatures, and a more uniform electric field inside the ceramics will reduce the additional energy loss. To better reveal the influence of Na/Pr/Ce doping on the valence state and coordination environment of CNPCBTM-x ceramics and further confirm the effect of Na/Pr/Ce doping on oxygen vacancy, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of CNPCBTM-x (x = 0, 0.10 and 0.20) was carried out. (a) shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of Ca 2p with two peaks, \u223c346.6 and \u223c350.3 eV, representing Ca 2p 3/2 and Ca 2p 1/2, respectively. (b) shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of Bi 4f; the two peaks, \u223c159.1 and \u223c164.4 eV, represent Bi 4f 7/2 and Bi 4f 5/2, respectively. The peaks corresponding to Ca 2p and Bi 4f move towards lower binding energy, suggesting that Na/Pr/Ce doping changes the coordination environment of CaE^{2+} and BiE^{3+}. In the crystal structure of CBT, BiE^{3+} is located in the A-site of the pseudo-perovskite layer and the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layer. The pseudo-perovskite layer is the source of piezoelectric and dielectric properties, whereas the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layer is the main source of resistivity. Thus, changes in the coordination environment of Bi ions may alter piezoelectric properties and resistivity of the samples, which will be demonstrated below. (c) shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of Ti 2p with two peaks, \u223c457.8 and \u223c465.7 eV, representing Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2, respectively, with no significant change in the position of the peaks. (d)\u2013(f) shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of O 1s after Gauss\u2013Lorentz fitting using Avantage software. Fitting results demonstrate three binding energy peaks, representing lattice oxygen O1 (\u223c529.6 eV), oxygen vacancy O2 (\u223c531.2 eV) and adsorbed oxygen O3 (\u223c532.4 eV). The percentage of oxygen vacancy is calculated using the area ratio of the O2 peak. For CNPCBTM-x ceramics with x = 0, 0.10 and 0.20, the atomic percentage of oxygen vacancy is 25.4 %, 23.5 % and 29.7 %, respectively. In general, oxygen vacancies are generated by the volatilisation of BiE^{3+} during the sintering process and it decreases the density and appearance of holes of the sample. Herein, the donor doping of PrE^{3+} and CeE^{3+} can reduce the oxygen vacancy concentration. The impedance complex plane plots at different temperatures were measured in the range of 100 Hz\u201310 MHz, as shown in (a)\u2013(c). The impedance complex plane plots of all the samples were regular semicircles, and the diameter of the semicircle decreased with increasing temperature, indicating that the resistance of the ceramics decreases with increasing temperature, implying a typical negative temperature coefficient of resistance. (d) shows an impedance complex plane plot of the CNPCBTM-x ceramics at 700 \xb0C, where Warburg impedance related to oxygen ion conduction is found in the low frequency portion, usually attributed to the blocking action of the platinum electrode on ions. Therefore, the impedance complex plane plots can be fitted using three R\u2013C parallel circuits. However, the impedance complex plane plots of CNPCBTM-x ceramics exhibit only a semicircle in the mid-frequency and high-frequency portions, implying that the conductive characteristic is similar and that the impedance response overlap of the grain and grain boundary. The impedance complex plane plots are fitted using ZView software. Considering the electrical heterogeneity of polycrystalline ceramics, the equivalent circuit used for fitting is two R\u2013C\u2013CPE parallel circuits ((d), inset). With increasing doping level, the resistivity of ceramics at 500 \xb0C increases first and then decreases. The resistivity of ceramics with x = 0.10 is increases to \u223c10E^{7} \u03a9 cm at 500 \xb0C. CBT-based ceramics follow a p-type/ionic mixed conduction mechanism. Higher resistivity corresponds to lower oxygen vacancy concentration, which is consistent with the XPS result. (f) shows the temperature dependence of the logarithmic conductivity for the sample. The activation energy (Ea) can be calculated using the Arrhenius formula as follows : where \u03c3 denotes the bulk conductivity (\u03a9E^{\u22121} cmE^{\u22121}), A denotes the pre-exponential factor, Ea denotes the activation energy of carrier migration (eV), k denotes the Boltzmann constant (J/K), and T denotes the absolute temperature (K). All samples exhibit higher Ea (1.3\u20131.7 eV) than pure CBT (\u223c1 eV), suggesting that the conductive process of the CNPCBTM-x ceramics is more difficult to excite. To better understand the dielectric relaxation behaviour of CNPCBTM-x ceramics, the frequency dependence of the imaginary part of electric modulus (M\u2033) plots is shown in. (a)\u2013(c) shows the frequency dependence of the normalized imaginary part of the electrical modulus (M\u2033/ Mmax\u2033) plots for the CNPCBTM-x ceramics with x = 0, x = 0.10 and x = 0.20. M\u2033/ Mmax\u2033 plots show apparent asymmetry, and the part of the curve below the M\u2033/ Mmax\u2033 peak presents a bulge, especially (as shown by the arrow). In addition, the curves of the frequency dependence of M\u2033/ Mmax\u2033 show apparent broadening, which indicates dielectric relaxation behaviour that deviates from the standard Debye relaxation. The peak of M\u2033/ Mmax\u2033 shifts to a higher frequency as the temperature increases, which indicates the temperature-dependent relaxation behaviour. Observing the curves of the frequency dependence of M\u2033/ Mmax\u2033 with different doping levels, the peak of M\u2033/ Mmax\u2033 first shifts to lower frequency and then shifts to higher frequency with the doping level increasing. Generally, the region below the frequency of the M\u2033/ Mmax\u2033 peak corresponds to the long-distance migration of charge carriers related to DC conductance, whereas the region above the frequency of the M\u2033/ Mmax\u2033 peak corresponds to the short-distance jump of charge carriers related to AC conductance. Therefore, the shift of the M\u2033/ Mmax\u2033 peak to a lower frequency for ceramics with x = 0.10 indicates that the long-distance migration of charge carriers is suppressed, which corresponds to a lower oxygen vacancy concentration and higher resistivity. This result is consistent with the oxygen vacancy concentration calculated by XPS fitting. (d)\u2013(f) shows the frequency dependence of M\u2033/ Mmax\u2033 and Z\u2033/ Zmax\u2033 plots for the CNPCBTM-x ceramics with x = 0, x = 0.10 and x = 0.20 at 600 \xb0C. The two curves do not show high coincidence, which further indicates the relaxation behaviour of CNPCBTM-x ceramics. In addition, the curve of the frequency dependence of M\u2033/ Mmax\u2033 exhibits relatively small broadening and high symmetry, which indicates that the oxygen vacancy contribution to the conductance is weakened, and the relaxation behaviour is weakened. The activation energy values of the relaxation process (E relax) were obtained using the Arrhenius formula as follows: where fp represents the frequency corresponding to the maximum value of M\u2033/ Mmax\u2033, f0 represents the frequency of the attempted transition, Erelax represents the relaxation activation energy (eV), k represents the Boltzmann constant (J/K), and T represents the absolute temperature (K). The relationship between fp and 1000/T was linearly fitted, and the Erelax was calculated. Results are shown in (g)\u2013(i). The Erelax of all samples is in the range of 0.5\u20132 eV, implying that the mechanism of the relaxation process is mainly related to the transition of oxygen vacancies. Piezoelectric coefficient d 33 and thermal stability of CBT-based piezoceramics are relevant indicators for their application under high-temperature conditions. (a) and (b) shows the P\u2013E and I\u2013E loops of CNPCBTM-x ceramics measured at 180 \xb0C. All samples show saturated ferroelectric hysteresis loops (P\u2013E loops). P\u2013E loops are slightly asymmetrical, suggesting the presence of an internal bias field. As mentioned above, Mn ions exist mainly in the form of MnE^{3+}. The replacement of MnE^{3+} for TiE^{4+} at B-sites will lead to the formation of Mn Ti\u2033. Mn Ti\u2033 tends to combine with oxygen vacancies to form ( Mn Ti\u2033\u2212 VO \u2219\u2219) defect dipoles. I\u2013E loops show apparent current spikes corresponding to domain switching, where CNPCBTM-x ceramics with x = 0.10 exhibit the largest I max, suggesting an enhanced domain switching effect. (c) shows the changes of remanent polarization P r and d 33 of CNPCBTM-x ceramics with the doping level increase. With the increase of the doping level, P r initially increases, then decreases and reaches a maximum value of 8.05 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at x = 0.10, suggesting that substantial Na/Pr/Ce co-doping promotes the switching of ferroelectric domains. The switching of ferroelectric domains is related to ( Mn Ti\u2033\u2212 VO \u2219\u2219) defect dipoles. The aggregation of ( Mn Ti\u2033\u2212 VO \u2219\u2219) near the domain wall has a strong pinning effect, which will hinder the switching of ferroelectric domains. According to the results of XPS, CNPCBTM-x ceramics with x = 0.10 have the lowest oxygen vacancy concentration. In addition, the value of d 33 first increases and then decreases, consistent with the change of P r. The value of d 33 increases from 14.8 pC/N at x = 0\u201322.3 pC/N at x = 0.10 due to the increase of remanent polarization and improved capability of domain switching. The annealing temperature dependence of the d 33 value for the CNPCBTM-x ceramics is presented in (d). The d 33 value of all the samples is relatively stable at <500 \xb0C. When the temperature is > 600 \xb0C, d 33 decreases rapidly owing to depolarization. The d 33 of CNPCBTM-0.10 ceramic is 21.2 pC/N at 500 \xb0C, which is equivalent to 95 % of d 33 at room temperature, suggesting that the piezoelectric activity of the sample exhibits excellent temperature stability. (e) shows the annealing temperature dependence of the ratio of d 33 at different annealing temperatures and d 33 at room temperature (d 33(T)/d 33(RT)) plot. The d 33 of CNPCBTM-0.10 ceramic shows the smallest drop at 500 \xb0C, implying that it possesses optimal temperature stability. The above results suggest that CNPCBTM-x ceramics with x = 0.1 not only have the highest d 33, but also exhibit optimal temperature stability. To better explain the advantages of CNPCBTM-0.10 ceramics, the comparison of the d 33 and T C values of CNPCBTM-0.10 ceramics in this study and those of other reported CBT-based piezoceramics is given in (f). CNPCBTM-0.10 ceramics exhibit relatively high d 33 and outstanding T C compared with other reported CBT-based piezoceramics, suggesting their potential for application in high-temperature conditions. To explain the external contribution of the enhanced piezoelectric performance of the CNPCBTM-x ceramics, the PFM amplitude images, phase images and phase images after PFM lithography are characterised, as shown in. The larger size of the domain, less quantity of the domain wall and uneven distribution of the domain are revealed for the ceramics with x = 0, which are thought to inhibit the enhancement of piezoelectric activity. For ceramics with x = 0.10, the number of domains increases, and the uniformity of the domain structure distribution improves, which can be attributed to the destruction of long-range ordered domain structures caused by doping. According to the phase contrast images after PFM lithography with 40 V voltage, domain switching is more apparent for ceramics with x = 0.10, which verifies the external reason for the improvement of piezoelectric properties.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The XRD patterns of the CNPCBTM-x ceramics over a 2\u03b8 range of 20\xb0\u201360\xb0 are shown in (a). The XRD patterns of all the samples correspond well with the PDF#52\u20131640 (CBT) card, suggesting that the doped ions have completely dissolved into the lattice and there is no secondary phase in all the samples. The diffraction peak with the highest intensity represents the (119) plane, which is consistent with the characteristic peak of BLSFs with m = 4. Moreover, the partially detailed patterns in the range of 2\u03b8 = 30\xb0\u201331\xb0 are shown in (b). Results reveal that the diffraction peak of the (119) plane shifts to a lower angle with increasing levels of Na/Pr/Ce co-doping, indicating an expansion of the lattices, which is caused by the substitution of doping ions with different radii at the A-site. The A-site in the pseudo-perovskite layer of CBT is occupied by CaE^{2+} and BiE^{3+}. By the molar ratio of the occupying atoms, it can be found that the average ionic radii of NaE^{+} (1.39 \xc5, CN = 12), PrE^{3+} (1.14 \xc5, CN = 12) and CeE^{3+} (1.34 \xc5, CN = 12) is larger than that of CaE^{2+} (1.34 \xc5, CN = 12) and BiE^{3+} (1.17 \xc5, CN = 12). The surface SEM images of the CNPCBTM-x ceramics after thermal etching are given in (a)\u2013(e), with the insets showing the grain size distributions.

Images showed that O, Na, Ca, Ti, Mn, Bi, Ce, and Pr are evenly distributed in the sample, suggesting that all doping ions have dissolved into the CBT lattice and formed a solid solution, consistent with the results of XRD. The T C and dielectric loss at high temperatures are closely related to the application of high-temperature piezoceramics. (a) shows the temperature dependence of the relative dielectric constant for the CNPCBTM-x ceramics, and the inset is T C of the CNPCBTM-x ceramics. The T C of the ceramics decreases from 813 \xb0C to 795 \xb0C with the increase of the doping level, and the T C of all samples is higher than that of pure CBT ceramics (\u223c790 \xb0C). The tolerance factor (t) can be expressed as t= ( RA+ RO)/ 2 ( RB+ RO), where RA, RB and RO represent the ion radius of the A-site cation, B-site cation and oxygen ion, respectively. According to Li et al., Mn ions show different valence states at different sintering temperatures: MnE^{2+} only exists at higher sintering temperatures (>1200 \xb0C), and MnE^{3+} exists at a sintering temperature of approximately 1000 \xb0C. MnE^{4+} is obtained by oxidation of MnE^{2+} and MnE^{3+} in the cooling process of sintering. However, the presence of MnE^{4+} is difficult to observe in ceramics because oxygen in the air is difficult to diffuse into the ceramics due to the dense structure of it during the sintering process. Thus, MnE^{3+} is the main form at the sintering temperature of this study. A large amount of MnE^{3+} (0.70 \xc5, CN = 6) substitutes for TiE^{4+} (0.605 \xc5, CN = 6) at the B-site of the pseudo-perovskite layer, and a small amount of MnE^{3+} occupies the A-site, which decreases the tolerance factor. Therefore, the T C of all doped samples is higher than that of pure CBT. XRD results in indicate that NaE^{+}, PrE^{3+} and CeE^{3+} with larger ionic radii occupy the A-site, which increases the tolerance factor. In summary, the T C of all samples is at a higher value due to the addition of a fixed content of MnO2 and the decrease in T C for different samples due to additional doping of Na/Pr/Ce. In addition, there are dielectric relaxation peaks near 600 \xb0C for ceramics with x = 0.15 and 0.20 (as shown in the orange circle), which are believed to be related to the relaxation time of the electric dipole caused by the defect. The appearance of dielectric relaxation peaks indicates that a higher doping level changes the state of the defect. (b) shows the temperature dependence of the dielectric loss for the CNPCBTM-x ceramics, with the inset being a partial magnification near 400 \xb0C. The dielectric loss of ceramics with x = 0, 0.05 and 0.10 at 400 \xb0C is lower than that of pure CBT (\u223c0.03) reported by Liu et al., and it is far lower than the dielectric loss of Mn doped CBT ceramics reported by Zhao et al.. However, there is increased dielectric loss for ceramics with x = 0.15 and 0.20, which indicates that the doping is excessive. Oxygen vacancy is thought to be the main cause of increased dielectric loss for BLSF ceramics. The low dielectric loss is advantageous for the application of CBT-based ceramics in high-temperature conditions. As shown in (b), ceramics with higher doping levels (x = 0.15 and 0.20) show lower dielectric loss above 600 \xb0C, which may be attributed to the uniform charge distribution caused by the diffusion of oxygen vacancy at high temperatures, and a more uniform electric field inside the ceramics will reduce the additional energy loss. To better reveal the influence of Na/Pr/Ce doping on the valence state and coordination environment of CNPCBTM-x ceramics and further confirm the effect of Na/Pr/Ce doping on oxygen vacancy, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of CNPCBTM-x (x = 0, 0.10 and 0.20) was carried out. (a) shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of Ca 2p with two peaks, \u223c346.6 and \u223c350.3 eV, representing Ca 2p 3/2 and Ca 2p 1/2, respectively. (b) shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of Bi 4f; the two peaks, \u223c159.1 and \u223c164.4 eV, represent Bi 4f 7/2 and Bi 4f 5/2, respectively. The peaks corresponding to Ca 2p and Bi 4f move towards lower binding energy, suggesting that Na/Pr/Ce doping changes the coordination environment of CaE^{2+} and BiE^{3+}. In the crystal structure of CBT, BiE^{3+} is located in the A-site of the pseudo-perovskite layer and the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layer. The pseudo-perovskite layer is the source of piezoelectric and dielectric properties, whereas the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layer is the main source of resistivity. Thus, changes in the coordination environment of Bi ions may alter piezoelectric properties and resistivity of the samples, which will be demonstrated below. (c) shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of Ti 2p with two peaks, \u223c457.8 and \u223c465.7 eV, representing Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2, respectively, with no significant change in the position of the peaks. (d)\u2013(f) shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of O 1s after Gauss\u2013Lorentz fitting using Avantage software. Fitting results demonstrate three binding energy peaks, representing lattice oxygen O1 (\u223c529.6 eV), oxygen vacancy O2 (\u223c531.2 eV) and adsorbed oxygen O3 (\u223c532.4 eV). The percentage of oxygen vacancy is calculated using the area ratio of the O2 peak. For CNPCBTM-x ceramics with x = 0, 0.10 and 0.20, the atomic percentage of oxygen vacancy is 25.4 %, 23.5 % and 29.7 %, respectively. In general, oxygen vacancies are generated by the volatilisation of BiE^{3+} during the sintering process and it decreases the density and appearance of holes of the sample. Herein, the donor doping of PrE^{3+} and CeE^{3+} can reduce the oxygen vacancy concentration. The impedance complex plane plots at different temperatures were measured in the range of 100 Hz\u201310 MHz, as shown in (a)\u2013(c). The impedance complex plane plots of all the samples were regular semicircles, and the diameter of the semicircle decreased with increasing temperature, indicating that the resistance of the ceramics decreases with increasing temperature, implying a typical negative temperature coefficient of resistance. (d) shows an impedance complex plane plot of the CNPCBTM-x ceramics at 700 \xb0C, where Warburg impedance related to oxygen ion conduction is found in the low frequency portion, usually attributed to the blocking action of the platinum electrode on ions. Therefore, the impedance complex plane plots can be fitted using three R\u2013C parallel circuits. However, the impedance complex plane plots of CNPCBTM-x ceramics exhibit only a semicircle in the mid-frequency and high-frequency portions, implying that the conductive characteristic is similar and that the impedance response overlap of the grain and grain boundary. The impedance complex plane plots are fitted using ZView software. Considering the electrical heterogeneity of polycrystalline ceramics, the equivalent circuit used for fitting is two R\u2013C\u2013CPE parallel circuits ((d), inset). With increasing doping level, the resistivity of ceramics at 500 \xb0C increases first and then decreases. The resistivity of ceramics with x = 0.10 is increases to \u223c10E^{7} \u03a9 cm at 500 \xb0C. CBT-based ceramics follow a p-type/ionic mixed conduction mechanism. Higher resistivity corresponds to lower oxygen vacancy concentration, which is consistent with the XPS result. (f) shows the temperature dependence of the logarithmic conductivity for the sample. The activation energy (Ea) can be calculated using the Arrhenius formula as follows : where \u03c3 denotes the bulk conductivity (\u03a9E^{\u22121} cmE^{\u22121}), A denotes the pre-exponential factor, Ea denotes the activation energy of carrier migration (eV), k denotes the Boltzmann constant (J/K), and T denotes the absolute temperature (K). All samples exhibit higher Ea (1.3\u20131.7 eV) than pure CBT (\u223c1 eV), suggesting that the conductive process of the CNPCBTM-x ceramics is more difficult to excite. To better understand the dielectric relaxation behaviour of CNPCBTM-x ceramics, the frequency dependence of the imaginary part of electric modulus (M\u2033) plots is shown in. (a)\u2013(c) shows the frequency dependence of the normalized imaginary part of the electrical modulus (M\u2033/ Mmax\u2033) plots for the CNPCBTM-x ceramics with x = 0, x = 0.10 and x = 0.20. M\u2033/ Mmax\u2033 plots show apparent asymmetry, and the part of the curve below the M\u2033/ Mmax\u2033 peak presents a bulge, especially (as shown by the arrow). In addition, the curves of the frequency dependence of M\u2033/ Mmax\u2033 show apparent broadening, which indicates dielectric relaxation behaviour that deviates from the standard Debye relaxation. The peak of M\u2033/ Mmax\u2033 shifts to a higher frequency as the temperature increases, which indicates the temperature-dependent relaxation behaviour. Observing the curves of the frequency dependence of M\u2033/ Mmax\u2033 with different doping levels, the peak of M\u2033/ Mmax\u2033 first shifts to lower frequency and then shifts to higher frequency with the doping level increasing. Generally, the region below the frequency of the M\u2033/ Mmax\u2033 peak corresponds to the long-distance migration of charge carriers related to DC conductance, whereas the region above the frequency of the M\u2033/ Mmax\u2033 peak corresponds to the short-distance jump of charge carriers related to AC conductance. Therefore, the shift of the M\u2033/ Mmax\u2033 peak to a lower frequency for ceramics with x = 0.10 indicates that the long-distance migration of charge carriers is suppressed, which corresponds to a lower oxygen vacancy concentration and higher resistivity. This result is consistent with the oxygen vacancy concentration calculated by XPS fitting. (d)\u2013(f) shows the frequency dependence of M\u2033/ Mmax\u2033 and Z\u2033/ Zmax\u2033 plots for the CNPCBTM-x ceramics with x = 0, x = 0.10 and x = 0.20 at 600 \xb0C. The two curves do not show high coincidence, which further indicates the relaxation behaviour of CNPCBTM-x ceramics. In addition, the curve of the frequency dependence of M\u2033/ Mmax\u2033 exhibits relatively small broadening and high symmetry, which indicates that the oxygen vacancy contribution to the conductance is weakened, and the relaxation behaviour is weakened. The activation energy values of the relaxation process (E relax) were obtained using the Arrhenius formula as follows: where fp represents the frequency corresponding to the maximum value of M\u2033/ Mmax\u2033, f0 represents the frequency of the attempted transition, Erelax represents the relaxation activation energy (eV), k represents the Boltzmann constant (J/K), and T represents the absolute temperature (K). The relationship between fp and 1000/T was linearly fitted, and the Erelax was calculated. Results are shown in (g)\u2013(i). The Erelax of all samples is in the range of 0.5\u20132 eV, implying that the mechanism of the relaxation process is mainly related to the transition of oxygen vacancies. Piezoelectric coefficient d 33 and thermal stability of CBT-based piezoceramics are relevant indicators for their application under high-temperature conditions. (a) and (b) shows the P\u2013E and I\u2013E loops of CNPCBTM-x ceramics measured at 180 \xb0C. All samples show saturated ferroelectric hysteresis loops (P\u2013E loops). P\u2013E loops are slightly asymmetrical, suggesting the presence of an internal bias field. As mentioned above, Mn ions exist mainly in the form of MnE^{3+}. The replacement of MnE^{3+} for TiE^{4+} at B-sites will lead to the formation of Mn Ti\u2033. Mn Ti\u2033 tends to combine with oxygen vacancies to form ( Mn Ti\u2033\u2212 VO \u2219\u2219) defect dipoles. I\u2013E loops show apparent current spikes corresponding to domain switching, where CNPCBTM-x ceramics with x = 0.10 exhibit the largest I max, suggesting an enhanced domain switching effect. (c) shows the changes of remanent polarization P r and d 33 of CNPCBTM-x ceramics with the doping level increase. With the increase of the doping level, P r initially increases, then decreases and reaches a maximum value of 8.05 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at x = 0.10, suggesting that substantial Na/Pr/Ce co-doping promotes the switching of ferroelectric domains. The switching of ferroelectric domains is related to ( Mn Ti\u2033\u2212 VO \u2219\u2219) defect dipoles. The aggregation of ( Mn Ti\u2033\u2212 VO \u2219\u2219) near the domain wall has a strong pinning effect, which will hinder the switching of ferroelectric domains. According to the results of XPS, CNPCBTM-x ceramics with x = 0.10 have the lowest oxygen vacancy concentration. In addition, the value of d 33 first increases and then decreases, consistent with the change of P r. The value of d 33 increases from 14.8 pC/N at x = 0\u201322.3 pC/N at x = 0.10 due to the increase of remanent polarization and improved capability of domain switching. The annealing temperature dependence of the d 33 value for the CNPCBTM-x ceramics is presented in (d). The d 33 value of all the samples is relatively stable at <500 \xb0C. When the temperature is > 600 \xb0C, d 33 decreases rapidly owing to depolarization. The d 33 of CNPCBTM-0.10 ceramic is 21.2 pC/N at 500 \xb0C, which is equivalent to 95 % of d 33 at room temperature, suggesting that the piezoelectric activity of the sample exhibits excellent temperature stability. (e) shows the annealing temperature dependence of the ratio of d 33 at different annealing temperatures and d 33 at room temperature (d 33(T)/d 33(RT)) plot. The d 33 of CNPCBTM-0.10 ceramic shows the smallest drop at 500 \xb0C, implying that it possesses optimal temperature stability. The above results suggest that CNPCBTM-x ceramics with x = 0.1 not only have the highest d 33, but also exhibit optimal temperature stability. To better explain the advantages of CNPCBTM-0.10 ceramics, the comparison of the d 33 and T C values of CNPCBTM-0.10 ceramics in this study and those of other reported CBT-based piezoceramics is given in (f). CNPCBTM-0.10 ceramics exhibit relatively high d 33 and outstanding T C compared with other reported CBT-based piezoceramics, suggesting their potential for application in high-temperature conditions. To explain the external contribution of the enhanced piezoelectric performance of the CNPCBTM-x ceramics, the PFM amplitude images, phase images and phase images after PFM lithography are characterised, as shown in. The larger size of the domain, less quantity of the domain wall and uneven distribution of the domain are revealed for the ceramics with x = 0, which are thought to inhibit the enhancement of piezoelectric activity. For ceramics with x = 0.10, the number of domains increases, and the uniformity of the domain structure distribution improves, which can be attributed to the destruction of long-range ordered domain structures caused by doping. According to the phase contrast images after PFM lithography with 40 V voltage, domain switching is more apparent for ceramics with x = 0.10, which verifies the external reason for the improvement of piezoelectric properties.
