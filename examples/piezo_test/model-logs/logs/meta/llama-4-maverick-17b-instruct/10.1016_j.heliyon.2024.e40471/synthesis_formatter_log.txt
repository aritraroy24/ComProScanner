Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'Solid State Reaction', 'precursors': ['PbO', 'BaCO3', 'Nb2O5', 'Nd2O3'], 'steps': ['Mixing and grinding raw powdered materials.', 'Heating the mixture at high temperatures (1250 °C for 2 h) with 6 wt% of PbO to balance lead loss.', 'Adding methanol as a dispersing agent and leaving it for 1 h.', 'Adding PVA (5 wt%) as a binder.', 'Pressing the powder into pellets using a uniaxial hydraulic press at 150 MPa.', 'Sintering the pellets in an air atmosphere at 1150 °C for 4 h.'], 'characterization_techniques': ['Powder-XRD', 'SEM', 'Dielectric study', 'd33 m']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
