The 0.93(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3-0.06BaTiO3-0.01(K0.5Na0.5)NbO3 (BNT-6BT-1KNN) single crystals were grown using Bi2O3, Na2CO3, NaF, and K2CO3 as fluxing agents. The precursor powders were prepared according to stoichiometric ratios, with raw materials of the following purities: Bi2O3 (>99.99 %), Na2CO3 (>99.5 %), BaCO3 (>99.99 %), K2CO3 (>99.98 %), TiO2 (>99.8 %), and Nb2O5 (>99.99 %). These components were thoroughly mixed in ethanol via ball milling for 15 h. After drying, the mixture was placed into a covered alumina crucible and calcined at 810 \xb0C for 5 h to produce the precursor powders. The mixture was heated to 1200 \xb0C and slowly cooled to 850 \xb0C to promote single crystal growth. The crystal structure was analyzed using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D2 PHASER, Bruker AXS, Karlsruhe, Germany) with a 2\u03b8 scanning range of 20\xb0\u2013100\xb0, and the powder XRD patterns were refined with Fullprof software. Raman spectroscopy was performed using a laser Raman spectrometer (LabRAM HR Evolution, HORIBA, Paris, France) with a laser wavelength of 532 nm. The evolution of domain structures was investigated using a piezoelectric force microscope (PFM, Asylum Research Cypher ES(EC-AFM), Oxford Instruments, UK). For electrical characterization, the cut crystal wafers were coated with silver paste and sintered at 850 \xb0C for 30 min. Poling was achieved by immersing the single crystals in silicone oil and applying a DC electric field of 40 kV/cm for 10 min at room temperature. The piezoelectric coefficient d 33 was measured with a piezoelectric d 33 meter (ZJ-3AN; Beijing Institute of Acoustics, China), while dielectric da were collected using an LCR meter with temperature control (4294A; Agilent, Santa Clara, USA). The ferroelectric properties and electric strain responses at 1 Hz were evaluated using a ferroelectric test system (TF Analyzer 2000E, aixACCT, Aachen, Germany).

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
a shows images of the BNT-6BT-1KNN single crystals, which are earthy yellow, with a maximum size of 5 \xd7 5 \xd7 3 mmE^{3}. The bulk XRD patterns reveal that the single crystals are preferentially oriented along the {001}c plane (b). The {200}c reflection in the unpoled specimen exhibits distinct peak splitting, indicating significant tetragonality in the single crystal with a lattice constant ratio of c T /a T = 1.009. After poling, there is minimal change in the c T /a T ratio, accompanied by an increase in the intensity of the (100)c reflection peak. The powdered XRD patterns before and after poling at room temperature indicate a cubic-like phase, which was also confirmed by the Rietveld refinement analyses (, in the supporting information). For a typical non-ergodic state, the XRD pattern of the poled specimen typically shows an apparent ferroelectric phase. However, in the case of BNT-6BT-1KNN single crystals, no similar characteristics were observed in the powered specimens. Although we did not conduct TEM experiments, based on the results from BNT-6BT-3KNN single crystals, we speculate that there is a coexistence of local P4bm and R3c phases in BNT-6BT-1KNN single crystals. First, the maximum strain of 0.16 % on the positive side of the electric field is significantly larger than that (0.1 %) observed on the negative side. Second, a remnant strain of 0.05 % is detected. Finally, the minimum strain on the negative side of the field, measuring \u22120.04 %, differs from that typically observed in BNT-based non-ergodic relaxor ceramics. To further confirm the electric field-induced ferroelectric properties, local domain polarization experiments were conducted using piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM). The initial phase and amplitude images of the PFM, along with those after applying a 50 V voltage, are shown in b, respectively. In the initial state, the PFM images suggest the presence of polar nano regions. A sequence of \u221250 to 50 V DC voltage was applied to a local area parallel to the specimen surface (b) over a scan area of 3 \xd7 3 \u03bcmE^{2}, with a positive voltage applied to a 1 \xd7 1 \u03bcmE^{2} region within the planned area. The PFM image revealed opposite responses in the inner and outer square regions, indicating a long-range ferroelectric state induced by the electric field (c). These observations were further corroborated by the symmetric amplitude-voltage \u201cButterfly\u201d curves (d). The temperature dependence of relative permittivity and dielectric loss of BNT-6BT-1KNN single crystals is shown in. At room temperature, the unpoled specimen exhibits significant frequency dispersion, suggesting the possible presence of polar nanoregions (PNRs). More importantly, the poled specimen shows a sharp increase in the relative permittivity around 106 \xb0C, accompanied by anomalies the temperature dependence of dielectric loss. Combined with PFM results, this finding suggests a ferroelectric-relaxor phase transition. Above T F-R , the temperature dependence of the imaginary part of the relative permittivity shows a frequency-dependent anomaly ( in the supporting information), giving a freezing temperature (T f ) of 106 \xb0C based on the Vogel-Fulcher law. Above 230 \xb0C, the relative permittivity becomes frequency independent, which may suggest that the change in the behaviors of PNRs. To define the transition temperature (T B ) between the relaxor and paraelectric states, the relationship between the reciprocal of relative permittivity and temperature is fitted using the Curie-Weiss law, giving a T B of 345 \xb0C (d). At room temperature, the BNT-6BT-1KNN single crystals exhibit a piezoelectric coefficient d 33 of 263 pC/N and a thickness longitudinal electromechanical coupling coefficient K t of 0.43. ( a and b). Compared to BNT-6BT-1KNN ceramics or single crystals by the SSCG method , BNT-6BT-1KNN single crystals exhibit a higher piezoelectric coefficient (c). At 65 \xb0C below T F-R , the piezoelectric coefficient reaches a maximum value of 295 pC/N. The d 33 value increases again above T F-R , suggesting the presence of the long-range domains after poling. Notably, the temperature for the disappearance of piezoelectric properties coincides with the transition point (\u223c230 \xb0C) where the frequency-dependent behaviors of the relative permittivity change. a shows the polarization-electric field (P-E) curves and bipolar strain-electric field (S-E) curves of BNT-6BT-1KNN single crystals at various temperatures. As the temperature increases above 75 \xb0C, both the maximum polarization (P max) and remnant polarization (P r ) decrease compared to room temperature, likely due to changes in the polarization process. Additionally, the electrostrain gradually increases with increasing temperature, a common phenomenon in BNT-based materials. At 175 \xb0C, the hysteresis loops exhibit characteristics of a relaxor ferroelectric, with the disappearance of negative electrostrain and a maximum electrostrain of 0.47 %. The inverse piezoelectric coefficient is 940 pm/V. b summarizes the maximum electrostrain S max and P r at various temperatures. Above T F-R , the P r value exhibits a significant decrease from 125 \xb0C to 175 \xb0C, corresponding to a large increase in S max. As shown in , the Raman spectra of the BNT-6BT-1KNN single crystals measured from 25 \xb0C to 500 \xb0C can be divided into three primary regions : (1) Peaks at wavenumbers \u2264200 cmE^{\u22121}, which are primarily attributed to the vibrations of A-site ions (Bi, Na, and K) in the perovskite structure, with the Bi-O bond peak typically observed around 75 cmE^{\u22121}; (2) The peak at approximately 260 cmE^{\u22121} corresponds to the vibrations of B-site B-O bonds; (3) Peaks in the 450 to 700 cmE^{\u22121} range, usually associated with the vibrations of BO6 octahedra. b presents the intensity changes in peaks from regions A, B and C as a function of temperature. As the temperature increases, the intensity of the Bi-O bond vibration peak near 75 cmE^{\u22121} in region A, as well as the relative intensity of the B-O bond vibration peak at wavenumbers above 200 cmE^{\u22121} in region B, gradually decreases. In region C, the BO6 octahedral vibration peaks become narrower and weaker. Above 300 \xb0C, the Raman active mode near 75 cmE^{\u22121} almost disappears, corresponding to the emergence of the paraelectric phase.
