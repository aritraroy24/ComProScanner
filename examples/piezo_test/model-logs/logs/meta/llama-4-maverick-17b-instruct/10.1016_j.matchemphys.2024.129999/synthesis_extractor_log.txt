The ML models for the given study are implemented using the \u201cscikit-learn\u201d library based on the python language. Three models were implemented in the study, namely, \u201cSVR-rbf,\u201d \u201cXG-Boost,\u201d and \u201crandom forest,\u201d to perform the forecast of the properties. In the present analysis, two different datasets were prepared with a total of 13 features for TC/TOT prediction and 14 features for the prediction of the dielectric temperature spectrum from the literature. The analysis will classify the two datasets as \u201cDataset 1\u201d and \u201cDataset 2\u201d for further discussion. In dataset 1, a total of 114 different lead-free compositions from the literature with their corresponding TC and TOT values were added. The research task here did not consider compositions having TOT phase transition temperatures less than 0 \xb0C. Meanwhile, Dataset 2 contains different compositions (approximately 154 compositions) of lead-free ceramics, with their dielectric temperature spectrum information constituting a total number of entries of 11625. In Dataset 2, the entries for each composition are collected from the experimental results demonstrated in the literature, having an even temperature spacing of 2\xb0C, and the remaining features were calculated similarly to Dataset 1. In Dataset 2, the current analysis did not consider the exact temperature range for various compositions, as temperature ranges differ with different literature. Further, the \u201cRoot Mean Square Error\u201d (RMSE) score is used for the test dataset to estimate the performance of the implemented machine learning models. Next, in order to tune the models with an appropriate set of hyperparameters, the \u201cGridSearchCV\u201d routine available in the scikit-learn library is utilized with a sufficient sample space of hyperparameters. In \u201cGridSearchCV,\u201d the RMSE score is implemented to identify the unique set of hyperparameters for the model's optimal performance. The features created in training and test datasets were standardized so that the resulting mean and standard deviation were 0 and 1, respectively, to avoid the magnitude bias among the features. In order to create a train and test dataset, the available dataset is divided in the ratio of 70:30 for further modeling. The process mentioned above is adopted for Dataset 1 only; as for Dataset 2, a separate test dataset is created to evaluate the prediction capabilities of the model.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Now, to further experimentally validate our approach towards prediction, Li-doped BaTiO3 ceramics were synthesized with varying weight percentages of Li (0 wt%, 2 wt%, and 4 wt%) using the solvothermal approach. During the Rietveld refinement, all the samples demonstrated a single-phase structure (tetragonal p4mm), and no impurity phase was detected. As observed from , peak (110), slightly shifted towards lower angles upon increase of lithium percentage, which is consistent with the literature. With 12 coordination number, BaE^{2+} and Li E^{+} have ionic sizes of 0.161 nm and 0.118 nm, respectively, whereas with coordination number 6, TiE^{4+} and Li E^{+} have ionic sizes of 0.061 nm and 0.076 nm, respectively. Hence, the decrease in the lattice parameters upon adding Li E^{+} ions is due to the substitution of BaE^{2+} with LiE^{+}, while the increase in them is because of the substitution of LiE^{+} at the B-site upon higher percentage doping. Further, shows the elemental analysis of the prepared BaTiO3 sample which confirms the presence of barium and titanium in the composition. Transmission electron microscopy results provide more insights into the structure of the synthesized BaTiO3 nanoparticles, as shown in. Transmission electron microscopy results revealed the formation of nanoparticles of BaTiO3 and 4 % Li\u2013BaTiO3 compositions with a diameter in the range of 30\u2013100 nm. Inset in revealed the SAED pattern for both samples, and the results display polycrystalline diffused diffraction rings, indicating the polycrystalline nature of the composition. Analysis of SAED patterns was carried out with the help of CrysTBox software. In this section, the dielectric properties of the Li-doped BaTiO3 samples were analyzed. For dielectric measurements of the samples, the powders were pressed, and the pellets were sintered in a closed environment at 1100 \xb0C for 2 h. Investigating the imaginary component of electric modulus (M\u2033) is critical for unravelling the material's electrical transport dynamics, and hopping mechanisms. The emergence of peaks in the M\u2033 vs log(frequency) as well as tan\u03b4 vs log(frequency) plot reflects the relaxation processes occurring within the material. The high dispersion of relative permittivity in lower frequency limits is predominantly ascribed to the Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars (MWS) effect, also known as space-charge polarization. In the overall range of frequency, 4 % Li\u2013BaTiO3 showed relatively less dielectric loss as compared to other compositions. The temperature-dependent dielectric spectrum of all samples was captured with the help of a dielectric impedance spectroscope at 10 MHz, and the prediction of the dielectric plot was carried out. The dielectric results of the Li\u2013BaTiO3 samples are consistent with the earlier literature. As observed, the predictions are in good agreement with the actual results except for the 2 % Li\u2013BaTiO3 sample ( ). The Curie temperature for all the synthesized samples is tabulated in , along with predicted values from the ML algorithms. As in the given study, we predicted TC and TOT for lead-free compositions and also extended the same ML model for Li-doped BaTiO3 systems. As mentioned, it is clearly visible from the feature importance, TC is highly influenced by the nature of elements at the B-site of the crystal structure. In the case of size factors, the atomic volume of B-site elements and CRSB are important and directly influence the piezoelectric properties. Among electrochemical properties, ENB is critical as ferroelectric properties gets highly influenced by the electronegativity of the elements. In the present section, we employed machine learning-based reverse engineering to optimize the synthesis process of lead-free ceramics, utilizing a combination of features denoted as VA and VB. The above observation strongly suggests that the employed machine learning regression model successfully captured the underlying relationship between the input features (VA and VB), and the target properties during the training phase, and the training allowed the model to replicate it well during the prediction of the unseen data. In conclusion, the XG-boost model not only delivers optimal performance but also unveils new physical insights through its effective feature engineering capabilities. A similar analysis based on the contour plots with features CRSA and CRSB for given properties is provided in. With the help of the developed regression model, we attempted to understand the variation of TC and TOT over a wide range of compositions given as (Ba1-x-yCaxLiy) (Ti1-u-v-wZruSnvHfw) O3. The values of all the variables vary in the range as, 0 < x, y < 0.3, and 0 < u, v, w < 0.2 with a step size of 0.05. A python program is developed, giving a total compositional space of around 6150. The constraints for stoichiometry are provided as, x + y \u2264 0.3 and u + v + w \u2264 0.75, respectively to avoid the other phase formation. The trained model with Dataset 1 predicted the functional properties for the complete compositional space created, and the 3D scatter plots were plotted and shown in. All 1400 computationally created compositions were tabulated and sorted to trace back the element-wise stoichiometry of the composition, allowing us to optimize the synthesis process with a specific range for target property. He et al. to find the optimized composition of piezoelectric ceramic with the highest value of d33. For example, if a specific application needs ceramics with TC in the range of 90\u2013100 \xb0C, the present machine learning model can suggest several compositions having Curie temperature in the given range. The same approach can be extended to other properties such as, d33, energy storage properties, and ferroelectric properties for the given system.
