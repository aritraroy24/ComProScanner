R 1 is the dynamic resistance that describes the mechanical loss of the transducer. These can be defined as where C 1 is the dynamic capacitance of the transducer, R 1 is the dynamic resistance, f +1/2 and f -1/2 represent the upper and lower frequency at which the conductance is fifty percent of the conductance achieved at f r, respectively. where C 0 is the static capacitance constant of the ultrasonic transducer, and R 0 is the dielectric loss of the piezoelectric material, tan\u03b4 is the dielectric loss tangent. The power capacity P and power density W e can be calculated using the following formula : where E 3 represents the electric field intensity, \u03b5 33 Tis dielectric constant at constant stress, k eff represents the effective electromechanical coupling factor, and V is the total volume of the piezoelectric rings. The maximum voltage applied to the ultrasonic scalpel transducer is 150 Vrms. Based on the , it can be concluded that at resonance frequency of 55.5 kHz, the \u03b5 33 T , k eff , and Q m are critical determinants of the power output of the transducer. From the perspectives of \u03b5 33 T and k eff , PIMNT exhibit significantly higher values, suggesting that their power capacity is likely to surpass that of PZT. The resonance frequency for thickness extensional mode were calculated by where t represents the thickness of the ring and s 33 Drepresents elastic compliance constant at constant electric displacement field. Due to the higher s 33 D of the PIMNT single crystals , the resonance frequency of PIMNT crystal was lower compared to PZT piezoceramics. Therefore, it was necessary to reduce the thickness of the PIMNT ring to increase resonance frequency of the PIMNT transducer close to 55.5 kHz. The detailed dimension of each component is shown as followed in. (a) illustrates impedance spectrum of the transducer varies with the thickness of PIMNT rings, showing a direct correlation where thinner rings correspond to higher resonance frequency. In this study, the thickness of 1.5 mm was selected for each PIMNT ring, and PIMNT transducer structure is shown in (b). The piezoelectric rings were meshed using hexahedral elements, while the other metal components were meshed using free tetrahedron elements in COMSOL 5.5, as shown in (a) and (b). The maximum mesh size for all elements was set to less than 3 mm, which is significantly smaller than the wavelength of the ultrasonic waves. (c) and (d) illustrate the longitudinal mode of both PIMNT and PZT transducers, while (e) shows the impedance phase spectrum. The k eff were determined to be 17.5 % for the PIMNT transducer and 8.2 % for the PZT transducer in simulation. To enhance the fidelity of the simulations, we incorporated experimentally measured losses of the PZT rings and PIMNT rings into the model. The amplitude of the PIMNT transducer in simulation is 1.73 \u03bcm higher than PZT transducer of 1.12 \u03bcm. For this study, PZT-8 piezoceramics from Kunshan RiSheng Company and PIMNT single crystals (0.30PIN-0.40PMN-0.30PT) supplied by Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, were selected as materials. The PIMNT samples were sliced into 5\xd75\xd70.5 mmE^{3} wafers. Then, silver electrodes were painted onto sample surfaces and fired at 750 \u2103 for 30 min to form electrodes. The samples were then poled with an electric field of 10 kV/cm at 140 \u2103 for 15 min in silicone oil and then slowly cooled to room temperature while electric field was halved. A quasi-static d 33 meter at 55 Hz (ZJ-4AN, Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China) was utilized to measure d 33. The temperature dependence of the dielectric properties and coupling factors were characterized using an impedance analyzer (Agilent HP4294A, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The ferroelectric hysteresis loops were measured by a ferroelectric analyzer (TF2000, aixACCT, Germany). The impedance and admittance spectra of the PIMNT single crystal at room temperature is shown in (a) and (b), and the electromechanical performances k t can be calculated. The temperature-dependent dielectric constant \u03b5 r of the PIMNT single crystal at 1 kHz is presented in (c). It can be observed that the depolarization temperature T C is 172 \u2103. (d) illustrates the polarization-electric field (P-E) loops of the PIMNT single crystal at different temperatures, and E C and remanent polarization P r measuring approximately 4.4 kV/cm and 22.6 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at room temperature, respectively. Previous studies indicated that the conventional ultrasonic scalpels typically generate a temperature below 80 \u2103 while cutting the soft issue. The P-E loops were nearly identical below 80 \xb0C, indicating that the performance of the PIMNT crystal did not undergo significant changes. presents the measured values of d 33, k t and Q m for both PIMNT and PZT transducers. Considering that the maximum voltage of ultrasonic scalpel transducer in operation is 150 Vrms, the stability test of the PIMNT single crystal under a strong AC electric field was conducted to simulate the performance under actual usage conditions. (a) illustrates the variations in d 33, k t and \u03b5 r under different AC electric fields at 10 Hz. It is evident that as the electric field increases, the value of d 33, k t and \u03b5 r exhibit minimal variations, indicating that the application of AC voltage has a small impact on the performance of the PIMNT piezocrystal. Furthermore, (b) demonstrates the fatigue behavior before and after 1\xd710E^{7} bipolar cycles at 1000 Hz under a strong AC electric field of 2 kV/cm. The maximum polarization P max, P r, and the electric field at polarization equal to zero E 1 of the PIMNT single crystal exhibited no significant differences after multiple cycles of strong electric field excitation, indicating that the material is capable of long-term operation. (c) and (d) illustrate the polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loops and strain-electric field (S-E) curves of the PIMNT crystal at room temperature under the strong AC electric field. Under an electric field of 1.5\u20133 kV/cm in (c), the P-E loop displayed linear behavior, confirming that the PIMNT crystals remained in the [001] poled status with no domain reversal, thereby demonstrating excellent stability under this electric field. Furthermore, no significant hysteresis was observed under an AC electric field of 1.5 kV/cm in (d), suggesting that PIMNT single crystals can be effectively used at 1.5 kV/cm. PIMNT single crystals were selected based on their superior d 33, k t and \u03b5 r compared to PZT-8 piezoceramics. At the same time, the proven stability under the high temperature and strong electric field is essential for reliable performance in surgical environments and the PIMNT single crystal can be well-used in ultrasonic scalpel transducers. The transducers were fabricated as shown in (a) with a compressive stress of 30 MPa, and the actual thickness of PIMNT ring is 1.44 mm. The transducers were driven by a 2 Vpp sinusoidal signal within a frequency range of 50\u201360 kHz, generated using a function generator (RIGOL DG832) and continuously monitored with an oscilloscope (DS2302A). The vibrational response at the tip of the front of the ultrasonic transducer was measured using a MotionGo miniature laser vibrometer, configured with a velocity range of 20 m/s and a high-pass filter set to frequencies larger than 1 kHz. The impedance and phase spectrum of the simulated and fabricated PIMNT and PZT transducers are shown in (c), based on which the critical parameters were calculated and summarized in. It illustrates that PIMNT transducer exhibits a higher k eff, which is 1.8 times that of the PZT transducer, which can be attributed to higher k eff of the PIMNT crystals. In contrast, the PZT transducer demonstrated a higher Q m, which was twice as high as that of the former. Clearly, the PIMNT transducer exhibits a maximum amplitude of 2.67 \xb5m at resonance frequency, while the PZT transducer achieves a lower amplitude of 1.67 \xb5m. This difference can be attributed to the fact that the resonance response is proportional to d 33\xb7Q m. Although PIMNT piezocrystal had a lower Q m compared to the PZT piezoceramic, d 33 was significantly higher. Consequently, the product of these two factors was comparatively higher for PIMNT crystal, reaching 2.1 times that of PZT piezoceramics, which results in larger displacement in the fabricated PIMNT transducer. The measured result that PIMNT transducer exhibits higher displacement response than PZT transducer is in accordance with simulated result, with a slight difference in frequency and displacement. The simulations and experimental results validated the theoretical predictions, showing that PIMNT transducers achieved enhanced performance metrics, including larger vibration characteristics and higher k eff. This highlights the promising potential of utilizing PIMNT-based ultrasonic scalpel transducer in power ultrasound applications. As shown in (a), the transducer was immersed to a depth of approximately 18.5 mm in oil, achieving a load impedance of around 200 \u03a9, closely matching the actual operating load. (b) shows the impedance spectrum of two transducers in the load test. In the simulations, the viscous damping coefficient of 2.6 N\xb7s/m was applied to the front end of the PZT transducer, achieving an impedance of 200 \u03a9, closely aligning with the actual operating conditions. Using the same damping parameters, the PIMNT transducer was simulated. The results demonstrated that the simulated amplitude of the PIMNT transducer under load conditions was 0.42 \u03bcm, compared to 0.11 \u03bcm for the PZT transducer. This difference can be attributed to the higher d 33 of the PIMNT single crystal. From the data presented in and , it can be observed that both PIMNT and PZT transducer exhibit a shift in resonance frequency towards lower values due to the mass loading effect. Despite this shift, the k eff of PIMNT transducer remained higher than that of PZT transducer in oil load test. After the load test, it was calculated that, at the maximum applied voltage of 150 Vrms, power capacity and power density of the PIMNT transducer were 15.9 times and 27.6 times those of the PZT transducer, respectively.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
According to the formula for power capacity (, it can be analyzed that the reason for higher power capacity of the PIMNT transducer lies in the fact that both the \u03b5 33 T and k eff of the PIMNT single crystals are higher than those of the PZT piezoceramics. There is a considerable difference in Q m between the PIMNT single crystal and PZT piezoceramic, resulting in a lower Q m for the PIMNT transducer and a higher Q m for the PZT transducer. The calculated power capacity of the PIMNT transducer was 15.9 times that of the PZT transducer, indicating that transducers made with PIMNT single crystals can be applied in higher power output applications. Additionally, the calculated power density of the PIMNT transducer is 27.6 times that of PZT transducer, which facilitates the miniaturization of ultrasonic scalpel transducers while maintaining the same output power. The electro-acoustic efficiency \u03b7 ea of the transducer is very important in power ultrasonic equipment. Under optimal load conditions, the maximum electro-acoustic efficiency \u03b7 max of the transducer is determined by its dynamic parameter N eff. The optimum load coefficient P opt and \u03b7 max are expressed as follows: where Q e= 1/tan\u03c3 e, The calculated parameters are listed in. Both transducers exhibited a maximum electro-acoustic efficiency exceeding 0.92; however, neither achieved the optimal load coefficient under actual load conditions, resulting in lower efficiency. The efficiency of the PIMNT transducer was only 0.75, which is lower than the 0.88 of the PZT transducers. The current structure of the PIMNT transducer is similar to that of the PZT transducer and has not been redesigned according to the special properties of the PIMNT single crystal. Consequently, the efficiency of the PIMNT transducer is relatively low. In the future, the PIMNT transducer can be redesigned to achieve a higher electro-acoustic efficiency.
