The raw materials included Pb3O4 (95 % purity, Aladdin Chemical Reagent), SrCO3 (99.9 % purity, Macklin Chemical Reagent), MgO (99.99 % purity, Macklin Chemical Reagent), Nb2O5 (99.5 % purity, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent), TiO2 (98 % purity, Macklin Chemical Reagent), and ZrO2 (99.99 % purity, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent), which were mixed according to the stoichiometric ratio and accurately weighed. After ball milling for 18 h, the dried powder was calcined at 850 \xb0C for 3 h. Subsequently, MnCO3 (99 % purity, Macklin Chemical Reagent) was added and then ball-milled for 18 h. The polyvinyl butyral was used as a binder to press the dried powder into disks with a diameter of 10 mm. After removing organics at 600 \xb0C for 3 h, these green discs were sintered at 1150\u20131250 \xb0C for 3 h. For electrical measurements, both sides of the sintered circular sample were coated with silver electrodes and held at 550 \xb0C for 30 min. Then, the ceramics were polarized in a 150 \xb0C silicone oil with a direct current electric field of 3 kV/mm for 35min. The crystal structure of PSMNZT\u2013xMn ceramics was collected via X-ray diffractometer (XRD, SmartLab, Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) with Cu K\u03b1. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM, LEO-1530, OberkoChen, Germany) was used to observe surface morphology of PSMNZT\u2013xMn. Temperature-dependent dielectric properties were measured by a precision LCR meter (E4990A, Keysight, Santa Rosa, CA, USA) from 0 to 350 \xb0C. A ferroelectric test system (TF Analyzer 2000E; aixACCT, Aachen, Germany) was used to obtain the Polarization-electric field hysteresis (P\u2013E) loops and electric-field induced strain (S\u2013E) at 1 Hz. ESCALab 250 Xi electron spectrometer (XPS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) was used to measure the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of all ceramics. After being poled 24 h, the d 33 of the ceramic samples were tested by the quasi-static d 33 m (ZJ-3A, Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China). The dielectric loss tan\u03b4 and dielectric permittivity \u03b5 r at 1 kHz, anti-resonant frequency f a, resonant frequency f r, and impedance at resonant frequency |Z| of the ceramics were tested by an impedance analyzer (Agilent 4294A, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The ultrasonic transducer consisted of a sensitive element, a backing layer, and a matching layer, which were bonded together using high-temperature epoxy resin and cured in an oven at 150 \xb0C for 1 h. In this study, PSMNZT\u2013xMn piezoelectric ceramics were employed as sensitive elements, with the manganese (Mn) content denoted by x ranging from 0 to 0.8 in 0.2 increments. The backing layer was a mixture of epoxy resin and tungsten powder with a weight ratio of 3:1. The matching layer was an alumina ceramic disc with a thickness of 1 mm and a diameter of 12 mm, designed to protect the piezoelectric ceramic from wear and corrosion. A signal generator (ATA-40125, Aigtek, Xi'an, China) was configured to emit pulse triggers at 1 ms intervals, with an excitation voltage of 1 V for the pulse signal. After amplification by a factor of ten using a power amplifier (AFG 2021, Tektronix, USA), this signal drove the transmitting transducer. Subsequently, an oscilloscope (DSOX3014T, Keysight, USA) was employed to capture the ultrasonic signal received by the receiving transducer.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
XRD patterns of PSMNZT\u2013xMn ceramics in the 2\u03b8 range from 20\xb0 to 80\xb0 are shown in (a). It can be seen that the samples with different amounts of MnCO3 addition exhibit a pure perovskite structure, as verified by the standard PDF card of PDF#33\u20130784, which confirms that Mn ions have completely diffused into the ABO3 lattice. Furthermore, with the content of Mn rising, the lattice structure of PSMNZT\u2013xMn undergoes significant changes that can be observed in (b): the (200) diffraction peak near 45\xb0 transforms from a distinct split peak shape (x = 0.0) to a peak shape resembling a single peak (x = 0.8), demonstrating the crystal structure from a dominant T phase to a dominant R phase. As exhibited in (e), the (200) peak of PSMNZT\u20130.0Mn samples is composed of the (200)R single peak representing the rhombohedral phase (R phase) and the (200)T double peaks representing the tetragonal phase (T phase), with the T phase dominating. As the amount of Mn added increases, the single peak area represented by the R phase increases as shown in the x = 0.4 sample in (d). It demonstrates that the addition of excess Mn causes the (200) peak to become single, indicating that the R phase gradually dominates. To explore further the phase transformation in detail, two spatial structure models, R3m with R phase structure and P4mm with T phase structure were used to Rietveld refine the XRD patterns of PSMNZT\u2013xMn ceramics as displayed in (f)\u2013(j). The low weighted-pattern residual (R wp) of \u226410 % and goodness of fit (\u03c7 E^{2}) of \u22643 % indicate that the refinement results are reliable. The parameters of lattice and refinement for PSMNZT\u2013xMn samples are exhibited in. (k) exhibits the effect of Mn addition on phase fraction ratio. 93 % of P4mm and 7 % of R3m coexist in x = 0.0 sample. the phase fraction of P4mm gradually decreases as the amount of Mn added increases, while the phase fraction of R3m gradually increases. The phase fraction of R3m gradually increases to 35 % as x reaches 0.4, and further increases to 72 % when x = 0.8. This pertains to the replacement of B-site ions by Mn ions in PZT piezoelectric ceramics. The microstructure images of PSMNZT\u2013xMn samples are exhibited in (a)\u2013(e), and the average grain size (AGS) after statistics is plotted in (f). The microstructure of the ceramics has markedly changed with the addition of MnCO3. The AGS first rises, attains its maximum at x = 0.4, and subsequently declines. At first, MnCO3 as a typical sintering aid, not only lowers the temperature of the sintering point but also forms a liquid phase to connect adjacent grains and promote grain growth , as described in (a)\u2013(c). This may be because MnCO3 gradually reaches the solid solution limit in the PSMNZT system, and large grains are difficult to form due to the inhibition of excess Mn at grain boundaries. provides the SEM image and the corresponding elements distribution of PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn. All the elements including Mn are well dissolved in the PSMNZT grain size rather than segregated at the boundaries of the grains, which conforms with XRD results. In order to explore the defect configuration introduced by the addition of MnCO3 and their effects on the electrical properties, exhibits the XPS spectra of O 1s in PSMNZT\u2013xMn samples fitted by Lorentzian-Gaussian functions. It was reported that the O 1s spectra can be subdivided into lattice oxygen and oxygen vacancy, and their binding energies are around 529 eV and 531 eV, respectively. In general, the ratio of the oxygen vacancy characteristic peak area (S Oxygen vacancy) to all the oxygen peaks area (S Oxygen vacancy + S Lattice oxygen) can represent the oxygen vacancy concentration (R OV), which is expressed by the following formula and indicated in. A mass of oxygen vacancies ( VO \u2022\u2022) exist in x = 0.0 sample ((a)), which attributes to the volatilization of Pb during the sintering process as exhibited in the following formula eq. :  During the process of x increasing from 0.0 to 0.4, the oxygen vacancy concentration is significantly reduced because MnCO3 is an additive that can lower the temperature required for sintering and thereby suppress the volatilization of lead in the process eq.. In addition, considering the high sintering temperature of PSMNZT\u2013xMn (1150\u20131250 \xb0C), MnE^{2+} and MnE^{3+} ions coexist in the ceramics. Smaller MnE^{3+} (0.58 \xc5 for CN = 6, CN means coordination number) and MnE^{2+} (0.67 \xc5 for CN = 6) can replace B-site MgE^{2+} (0.72 \xc5 for CN = 6), accompanied by the following reaction:  The process eq. involves the consumption of oxygen vacancies, helping to higher piezoelectric response. Noting that the R OV further increases when x exceeds 0.4, this is mainly due to the replacement of the high valence ions at the B site by an additional Mn, as follows:  Point defects such as Mn Ti/Zr\u2033 and MnNb\u2034, formed by the substitution of parent B-site cations with Mn ions, will form defect dipoles with oxygen vacancies. These defect dipoles would greatly enhance the clamping effect on domains , leading to a significant degradation in piezoelectric properties. (a)\u2013(e) show the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant \u03b5 r and dielectric loss tan\u03b4 of different ceramic samples. The dielectric constants vs. the temperature of all ceramics are observed to have a sharp abnormal peak near 300 \xb0C, corresponding to the T c of the phase structural transformation process from ferroelectric to paraelectric. The T c decreases slightly with the addition of MnCO3, which indicates that Mn enters the lattice site of the ceramics. Moreover, the maximum dielectric constants (\u025b max) of all ceramic samples move towards the higher temperature with the increase of testing frequency, illustrating that all ceramics have obvious relaxation behavior. Subsequently, using the modified Curie-Weiss law of 1/\u03b5 \u2013 1/\u03b5 max = (T \u2013 T c)E^{ }/C to calculate the relaxation coefficient (\u03b3) , where \u03b5 max represents the dielectric constant at T c and C represents the Curie-Weiss constant. The \u03b3 value is usually between 1 and 2. When \u03b3 is equal to 1, the ceramic is a normal ferroelectric, while ceramic is an ideal relaxor ferroelectric when \u03b3 = 2. The ln(1/\u03b5 r \u2013 1/\u03b5 m) as a function of ln(T \u2013 T c) curves obtained from the temperature dependence of dielectric constant at 1 kHz is shown in (f), and the slope (red line) of the fitting curves is the \u03b3 value. All the \u03b3 values are between 1.69 and 1.85, indicating that all the ceramics exhibit typical relaxor ferroelectrics. The \u03b3 value firstly increases from 1.69 to 1.85 as x rises to 0.4 and then decreases. The highest \u03b3 for x = 0.4 sample demonstrates that the ceramic exhibits the strongest relaxor behavior because Mn enters the B sites of the PSMNZT ceramic system. This enhances the local heterogeneity of the system, creates random fields, disrupts the correlation between polar nanoregions (PNRs), and thus increases the degree of relaxation in the system. For ceramics where x exceeds 0.4, the degree of relaxation decreases. The electrical performance of PSMNZT\u2013xMn ceramics is displayed in. The maximum \u03b5 r for the PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn sample should be related to the large polarization intensity induced by large grain size. The uniform grain size and high packing density are the reasons for the low tan\u03b4 of all samples , as demonstrated by the SEM images. The resonance\u2013antiresonance spectra of PSMNZT\u2013xMn in are utilized to calculate the value of k p and Q m. The best piezoelectric performances (d 33 = 708 pC/N; k p = 74 %) are achieved in x = 0.4 sample. (a) exhibits the P\u2013E loops of PSMNZT\u2013xMn samples tested at room temperature and under a series of external electric fields. All saturated P\u2013E loops illustrate that all compositions exhibit good ferroelectricity. It demonstrates that the P r first reaches its maximum value as x increases to 0.4, and then gradually decreases. The current\u2013electric field loops (I\u2013E) in (b) show that the peak current of the PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn sample is significantly greater than the others, suggesting that more facile ferroelectric domain switching process. The unipolar S\u2013E and bipolar S\u2013E curves at room temperature of PSMNZT\u2013xMn ceramics are exhibited in (d) and (e), respectively. (f) summarizes the variation trend of unipolar strain S uni and bipolar strain S pos. The S uni is derived from the maximum strain measured in unipolar S\u2013E curves divided by the thickness of the sample, while the S pos is derived from the maximum strain measured in bipolar S\u2013E curves divided by the sample thickness. The PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn ceramic exhibits the maximum S uni of 0.214 % and S pos of 0.207 %, which indicates that PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn ceramic has the best piezoelectric properties. It can be concluded that the addition of Mn into the PSMNZT system can observably enhance the piezoelectric property. First, the PSMNZT\u2013xMn ceramics located MPB region possess abundant polarization directions because there are eight polarization directions in the R phase structure and six polarization directions in the T phase structure, which is conducive to the domain switching and thus enhances the piezoelectric response. Compared with the ceramics at x = 0 and x = 0.2, both of which have a crystal structure dominated by the T-phase, x = 0.4 ceramic primarily has R phase, which allows it to own more polarization directions. Furthermore, the stress of local internal produced by the distortion of 90\xb0 ferroelastic domain in the tetragonal phase is larger than that induced by 109\xb0 and 71\xb0 ferroelastic domains in the rhombohedral phase. The crystal structure of the ceramic at x = 0.4 is reasonably inferred to be at the optimal MPB, given its exhibition of ultra-high piezoelectric properties. When x > 0.4, the further increase in the R phase content will cause the proportion of the two phases to gradually deviate from the MPB region with optimal piezoelectric properties, resulting in a decrease in piezoelectric performance. Second, x = 0.4 ceramic has the largest grain size, which is beneficial for their response to external electric fields. Third, for PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn, the lowest concentration of oxygen vacancy will result in stronger ferroelectric activity and higher piezoelectric response. The significant decline in both piezoelectric and dielectric properties when x surpasses 0.4 is associated with intense internal stresses stemmed from small grains combined with a pronounced pinning effect due to defect dipoles. Additionally, it is found that the Q m of PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn also increases to a moderate value, which may be related to the pinning effect caused by defect dipoles induced by the addition of Mn. To analyze the origin of the outstanding piezoelectric response, the Rayleigh analysis was performed on PSMNZT\u2013xMn ceramics as shown in (a). Rayleigh law is expressed by the following equations: where the S ( E0) represents the unipolar strain value driven by the external electric field E 0. The Rayleigh coefficient a is caused by the switching of non-180\xb0 domain walls, and aE 0 indicates the extrinsic contribution to the piezoelectric response. Otherwise, to prevent the nucleation of new domains, the E 0 must be much smaller than the coercive electric field. The change trends of d init, a, and aE 0/(d init + aE 0) with x are plotted in (b)\u2013(d). The results show that PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn ceramic has the largest contribution of the above two kinds to the piezoelectric response. On the one hand, due to the flatter free energy distribution in the improved MPB region, PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn has a stronger intrinsic piezoelectric response. The ceramics with high or low Mn content will cause the system to deviate from the MPB region, significantly weakening the piezoelectric properties. On the other hand, the peak extrinsic piezoelectric contribution aE 0/(d init + aE 0) (28.7 %) and Rayleigh coefficient a (40.8) for PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn sample indicate a significant enhancement in irreversible domain wall motion. The largest grain size and reducing defect concentration in the PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn sample could weaken the clamping effect on ferroelectric domains and facilitate domain switch. In addition, the decreasing PNR sizes, which are verified by the enhanced dielectric relaxor behavior, is also beneficial for domain switching. The stability of temperature for PSMNZT\u2013xMn samples is investigated for potential industrial application. (a) shows the change trend of d 33 as a function of temperature. PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn ceramic shows the highest d 33 and excellent d 33 stability with a change of less than 10 % between 25 \xb0C and 250 \xb0C. (b) shows the unipolar electro-induced strain curves of PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn at different temperatures under a fixed electric field of 1 kV/mm. The S uni fluctuates less than 5 % in the 60 \xb0C\u2013200 \xb0C temperature range, indicating that PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn possesses excellent temperature stability in a broad range of temperatures. (c) displays the function of k p with respect to temperature over a test range from room temperature to 240 \xb0C. The temperature-insensitive characteristics of PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn over an extremely wide range can be attributed to the retention of a predominantly stable tetragonal crystal structure. Besides, (d) compares the d 33, k p, and T c of the x = 0.4 sample with other piezoelectric ceramics reported recently. The results show that PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn prepared in this work is an outstanding candidate for high-temperature piezoelectric ceramics. In summary, PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn has excellent piezoelectric properties, electromechanical conversion properties and Curie temperature, and excellent temperature stability, which indicates that PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn piezoelectric ceramic can be competent for applications such as high-temperature piezoelectric transducers, actuators, etc. (a) and (b) display the schematic and physical images of the assembled transducer. The ultrasonic waves produced by the transmitter were received by the receiver, which used the same PSMNZT\u2013xMn ceramic material and was then converted to voltage. The time-domain voltage waveform of the PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn ceramic ultrasonic transducer is illustrated in (c). Here, \u0394 V represents the voltage signal, calculated as the difference between the absolute values of the maximum and minimum voltages of the first wave response. Voltage signals from the other PSMNZT\u2013xMn transducers are detailed in the supplementary material, as shown in. It is evident that all transducers prepared based on PSMNZT\u2013xMn ceramics have successfully achieved the mutual conversion of mechanical and electrical energy, exhibiting identical waveform profiles in their voltage time-domain signals, which indicates their excellent potential for application. Since the properties of PSMNZT\u2013xMn ceramics vary with x, \u0394 V are correspondingly affected, as presented in (d). Notably, the transducer based on PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn ceramic exhibits the highest voltage signal of 7.65 V. Consequently, this suggests that the ultrasonic transducer based on PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn offers optimal detection performance.

A mass of oxygen vacancies ( VO \u2022\u2022) exist in x = 0.0 sample ((a)), which attributes to the volatilization of Pb during the sintering process as exhibited in the following formula eq. :  During the process of x increasing from 0.0 to 0.4, the oxygen vacancy concentration is significantly reduced because MnCO3 is an additive that can lower the temperature required for sintering and thereby suppress the volatilization of lead in the process eq.. In addition, considering the high sintering temperature of PSMNZT\u2013xMn (1150\u20131250 \xb0C), MnE^{2+} and MnE^{3+} ions coexist in the ceramics. Smaller MnE^{3+} (0.58 \xc5 for CN = 6, CN means coordination number) and MnE^{2+} (0.67 \xc5 for CN = 6) can replace B-site MgE^{2+} (0.72 \xc5 for CN = 6), accompanied by the following reaction:  The process eq. involves the consumption of oxygen vacancies, helping to higher piezoelectric response. Noting that the R OV further increases when x exceeds 0.4, this is mainly due to the replacement of the high valence ions at the B site by an additional Mn, as follows:  Point defects such as Mn Ti/Zr\u2033 and MnNb\u2034, formed by the substitution of parent B-site cations with Mn ions, will form defect dipoles with oxygen vacancies. These defect dipoles would greatly enhance the clamping effect on domains , leading to a significant degradation in piezoelectric properties. (a)\u2013(e) show the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant \u03b5 r and dielectric loss tan\u03b4 of different ceramic samples. The dielectric constants vs. the temperature of all ceramics are observed to have a sharp abnormal peak near 300 \xb0C, corresponding to the T c of the phase structural transformation process from ferroelectric to paraelectric. The T c decreases slightly with the addition of MnCO3, which indicates that Mn enters the lattice site of the ceramics. Moreover, the maximum dielectric constants (\u025b max) of all ceramic samples move towards the higher temperature with the increase of testing frequency, illustrating that all ceramics have obvious relaxation behavior. Subsequently, using the modified Curie-Weiss law of 1/\u03b5 \u2013 1/\u03b5 max = (T \u2013 T c)E^{ }/C to calculate the relaxation coefficient (\u03b3) , where \u03b5 max represents the dielectric constant at T c and C represents the Curie-Weiss constant. The \u03b3 value is usually between 1 and 2. When \u03b3 is equal to 1, the ceramic is a normal ferroelectric, while ceramic is an ideal relaxor ferroelectric when \u03b3 = 2. The ln(1/\u03b5 r \u2013 1/\u03b5 m) as a function of ln(T \u2013 T c) curves obtained from the temperature dependence of dielectric constant at 1 kHz is shown in (f), and the slope (red line) of the fitting curves is the \u03b3 value. All the \u03b3 values are between 1.69 and 1.85, indicating that all the ceramics exhibit typical relaxor ferroelectrics. The \u03b3 value firstly increases from 1.69 to 1.85 as x rises to 0.4 and then decreases. The highest \u03b3 for x = 0.4 sample demonstrates that the ceramic exhibits the strongest relaxor behavior because Mn enters the B sites of the PSMNZT ceramic system. This enhances the local heterogeneity of the system, creates random fields, disrupts the correlation between polar nanoregions (PNRs), and thus increases the degree of relaxation in the system. For ceramics where x exceeds 0.4, the degree of relaxation decreases. The electrical performance of PSMNZT\u2013xMn ceramics is displayed in. The maximum \u03b5 r for the PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn sample should be related to the large polarization intensity induced by large grain size. The uniform grain size and high packing density are the reasons for the low tan\u03b4 of all samples , as demonstrated by the SEM images. The resonance\u2013antiresonance spectra of PSMNZT\u2013xMn in are utilized to calculate the value of k p and Q m. The best piezoelectric performances (d 33 = 708 pC/N; k p = 74 %) are achieved in x = 0.4 sample. (a) exhibits the P\u2013E loops of PSMNZT\u2013xMn samples tested at room temperature and under a series of external electric fields. All saturated P\u2013E loops illustrate that all compositions exhibit good ferroelectricity. It demonstrates that the P r first reaches its maximum value as x increases to 0.4, and then gradually decreases. The current\u2013electric field loops (I\u2013E) in (b) show that the peak current of the PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn sample is significantly greater than the others, suggesting that more facile ferroelectric domain switching process. The unipolar S\u2013E and bipolar S\u2013E curves at room temperature of PSMNZT\u2013xMn ceramics are exhibited in (d) and (e), respectively. (f) summarizes the variation trend of unipolar strain S uni and bipolar strain S pos. The S uni is derived from the maximum strain measured in unipolar S\u2013E curves divided by the thickness of the sample, while the S pos is derived from the maximum strain measured in bipolar S\u2013E curves divided by the sample thickness. The PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn ceramic exhibits the maximum S uni of 0.214 % and S pos of 0.207 %, which indicates that PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn ceramic has the best piezoelectric properties. It can be concluded that the addition of Mn into the PSMNZT system can observably enhance the piezoelectric property. First, the PSMNZT\u2013xMn ceramics located MPB region possess abundant polarization directions because there are eight polarization directions in the R phase structure and six polarization directions in the T phase structure, which is conducive to the domain switching and thus enhances the piezoelectric response. Compared with the ceramics at x = 0 and x = 0.2, both of which have a crystal structure dominated by the T-phase, x = 0.4 ceramic primarily has R phase, which allows it to own more polarization directions. Furthermore, the stress of local internal produced by the distortion of 90\xb0 ferroelastic domain in the tetragonal phase is larger than that induced by 109\xb0 and 71\xb0 ferroelastic domains in the rhombohedral phase. The crystal structure of the ceramic at x = 0.4 is reasonably inferred to be at the optimal MPB, given its exhibition of ultra-high piezoelectric properties. When x > 0.4, the further increase in the R phase content will cause the proportion of the two phases to gradually deviate from the MPB region with optimal piezoelectric properties, resulting in a decrease in piezoelectric performance. Second, x = 0.4 ceramic has the largest grain size, which is beneficial for their response to external electric fields. Third, for PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn, the lowest concentration of oxygen vacancy will result in stronger ferroelectric activity and higher piezoelectric response. The significant decline in both piezoelectric and dielectric properties when x surpasses 0.4 is associated with intense internal stresses stemmed from small grains combined with a pronounced pinning effect due to defect dipoles. Additionally, it is found that the Q m of PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn also increases to a moderate value, which may be related to the pinning effect caused by defect dipoles induced by the addition of Mn. To analyze the origin of the outstanding piezoelectric response, the Rayleigh analysis was performed on PSMNZT\u2013xMn ceramics as shown in (a). Rayleigh law is expressed by the following equations: where the S ( E0) represents the unipolar strain value driven by the external electric field E 0. The Rayleigh coefficient a is caused by the switching of non-180\xb0 domain walls, and aE 0 indicates the extrinsic contribution to the piezoelectric response. Otherwise, to prevent the nucleation of new domains, the E 0 must be much smaller than the coercive electric field. The change trends of d init, a, and aE 0/(d init + aE 0) with x are plotted in (b)\u2013(d). The results show that PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn ceramic has the largest contribution of the above two kinds to the piezoelectric response. On the one hand, due to the flatter free energy distribution in the improved MPB region, PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn has a stronger intrinsic piezoelectric response. The ceramics with high or low Mn content will cause the system to deviate from the MPB region, significantly weakening the piezoelectric properties. On the other hand, the peak extrinsic piezoelectric contribution aE 0/(d init + aE 0) (28.7 %) and Rayleigh coefficient a (40.8) for PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn sample indicate a significant enhancement in irreversible domain wall motion. The largest grain size and reducing defect concentration in the PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn sample could weaken the clamping effect on ferroelectric domains and facilitate domain switch. In addition, the decreasing PNR sizes, which are verified by the enhanced dielectric relaxor behavior, is also beneficial for domain switching. The stability of temperature for PSMNZT\u2013xMn samples is investigated for potential industrial application. (a) shows the change trend of d 33 as a function of temperature. PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn ceramic shows the highest d 33 and excellent d 33 stability with a change of less than 10 % between 25 \xb0C and 250 \xb0C. (b) shows the unipolar electro-induced strain curves of PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn at different temperatures under a fixed electric field of 1 kV/mm. The S uni fluctuates less than 5 % in the 60 \xb0C\u2013200 \xb0C temperature range, indicating that PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn possesses excellent temperature stability in a broad range of temperatures. (c) displays the function of k p with respect to temperature over a test range from room temperature to 240 \xb0C. The temperature-insensitive characteristics of PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn over an extremely wide range can be attributed to the retention of a predominantly stable tetragonal crystal structure. Besides, (d) compares the d 33, k p, and T c of the x = 0.4 sample with other piezoelectric ceramics reported recently. The results show that PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn prepared in this work is an outstanding candidate for high-temperature piezoelectric ceramics. In summary, PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn has excellent piezoelectric properties, electromechanical conversion properties and Curie temperature, and excellent temperature stability, which indicates that PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn piezoelectric ceramic can be competent for applications such as high-temperature piezoelectric transducers, actuators, etc. (a) and (b) display the schematic and physical images of the assembled transducer. The ultrasonic waves produced by the transmitter were received by the receiver, which used the same PSMNZT\u2013xMn ceramic material and was then converted to voltage. The time-domain voltage waveform of the PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn ceramic ultrasonic transducer is illustrated in (c). Here, \u0394 V represents the voltage signal, calculated as the difference between the absolute values of the maximum and minimum voltages of the first wave response. Voltage signals from the other PSMNZT\u2013xMn transducers are detailed in the supplementary material, as shown in. It is evident that all transducers prepared based on PSMNZT\u2013xMn ceramics have successfully achieved the mutual conversion of mechanical and electrical energy, exhibiting identical waveform profiles in their voltage time-domain signals, which indicates their excellent potential for application. Since the properties of PSMNZT\u2013xMn ceramics vary with x, \u0394 V are correspondingly affected, as presented in (d). Notably, the transducer based on PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn ceramic exhibits the highest voltage signal of 7.65 V. Consequently, this suggests that the ultrasonic transducer based on PSMNZT\u20130.4Mn offers optimal detection performance.
