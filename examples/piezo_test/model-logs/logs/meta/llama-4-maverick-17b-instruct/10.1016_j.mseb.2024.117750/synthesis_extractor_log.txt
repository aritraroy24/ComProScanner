The thermodynamic characteristics of solids are utilized to analyze the performance in many applications under strident conditions, when temperature varies at three different pressures (0, 5 and 10 GPa). The GIBBS2 code employs the quasi-harmonic (QH) Debye theory based on the ab-initio approach to compute thermodynamic (TD) characteristics. Debye-Slater, Bebye-Gruneisen, Debye-Einstein, and QHA are the moduli that have an increasing order accuracy compared to one another. In the QH technique, there is a collection of data points including the values of [V,E(V)] that are used for evaluating the thermodynamic performance of materials.

The spectral characteristics of the \u03b3 for ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are presented in at three discrete pressures, covering a continuous temperature range. The system's anharmonic behavior can be elucidated by employing the anticipated values of the \u03b3.

Scientists' fascination with thermoelectric (TE) materials has grown tremendously in response to the global energy problem. This section presents an analysis of the thermoelectric (TE) properties of ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca)in order to evaluate their suitability for use in TE devices. The thermoelectric properties of the chalcogenide materials ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are evaluated by employing the traditional Boltzmann kinetic transport theory and the rigid band approximation. In order to assess the thermoelectric (TE) properties of the compounds described above, it is necessary to utilize fundamental TE characteristics such as thermal conductivity q=-k dT dx, power factor (PF=\u03c3 SE^{2}), electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient S= \u0394V \u0394T, and figure of merit ZT= ST \u03c1\u03baE^{2}. The BoltzTraP package, which is based on semi-classical theory, is utilized to compute the temperature-dependent thermoelectric (TE) characteristics, assuming a relaxation time constant. The spectral characteristics of the TE parameters of ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are presented in (a\u2013e), covering a temperature range of 0 to 1000 K. Electrical conductivity (\u03c3) is a measure of a material's capacity to conduct electricity. The spectral characteristics of the \u03c3 for ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are presented in (a), covering a temperature range of 0 to 1000 K. It is observed that there are no peaks at the beginning (i.e., \u03c3=0), and then peaks for BaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15start to appear at around 500and 550 K, respectively. These temperatures are known as the threshold value of \u03c3. Following the threshold temperature, there is a noticeable exponential rise in the \u03c3 plots as temperature increase. The upward trend observed in the \u03c3 plots provide evidence of the semiconducting properties of ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca). The values of \u03c3 for CaBi4Ti4O15 are higher than those for BaBi4Ti4O15 across the whole temperature range. The maximum conductivity values (\u03c3) for BaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15 are \xd7E^{4.81}E^{10}E^{16} and \xd7 \u03a9.m.s -E^{6.03}E^{10}E^{16}E^{1}, respectively. Both lattice vibrations and electrons play an integral part in the amount of heat conductivity (\u03ba) that semiconductors exhibit.The thermal conductivity \u03ba can be determined using Fourier's law. The spectral characteristics of the \u03ba for ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are presented in (b), covering a temperature range of 0 to 1000 K. It is observed that there are no peaks at the beginning (i.e., \u03ba=0), and then peaks for BaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15 start to appear at around 550 and 600 K, respectively. These temperatures are known as the threshold value of \u03ba. Following the threshold temperature, there is a noticeable exponential rise in the \u03ba plots as temperature increase.The reason for the increase in \u03ba at room temperature is that the wavelength of the phonons is greater than the size of the crystal boundary. All phonon contributions to \u03ba are either equal to or smaller than the crystal boundary. Moreover, the values of \u03ba for CaBi4Ti4O15 are higher than those for BaBi4Ti4O15 across the whole temperature range. The maximum thermal conductivity values (\u03ba) for BaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15 are \xd7E^{1.88}E^{10}E^{13} and \xd7 W m.K.sE^{2.14}E^{10}E^{13}, respectively. An electric potential difference (\u0394V) is generated as electrons migrate from a region of greater temperature to a region of lower temperature, driven by a temperature gradient made by connecting two different materials. The thermocouple's efficiency can be determined by calculating the Seebeck coefficient, which is the ratio of \u0394V to \u0394T. The spectral characteristics of the S for ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are presented in (c), covering a temperature range of 0 to 1000 K. Observing the S plots, it is evident that ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) exhibit positive S values, indicating that they are p-type semiconductor materials. The maximum S values for BaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15 are \xd7 -E^{2.18}E^{10}E^{3} and \xd7 - V/KE^{2.79}E^{10}E^{3}, respectively. Materials are considered to be excellent thermoelectric materials if their S values exceed 200 \u03bcV/K. The thermoelectric materials ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) exhibit S values that closely align with the stated standard. The spectral characteristics of the PF for ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are presented in (d), covering a temperature range of 0 to 1000 K. It is observed that there are no peaks at the beginning (i.e., PF=0), and then peaks for BaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15start to appear at around 500and 550 K, respectively. These temperatures are known as the threshold value of PF. Once the threshold temperature is reached, a noticeable exponential rise in PF plots become apparent as temperatures continue to grow. The maximum thermal power factors (PF) for BaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15are \xd7E^{2.71}E^{10}E^{10} and \xd7 W m. K.sE^{2.91}E^{10}E^{10}E^{2}, respectively. The spectral characteristics of the ZT for ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are presented in (e), covering a temperature range of 0 to 1000 K.ZT plots are utilized to ascertain the thermoelectric efficiency of the materials under investigation. For both materials, the ZT values are initially around 1.0 and subsequently exhibit an exponential increase with increasing temperature. The maximum ZT values forBaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15are1.43 and 1.36, respectively. For a thermoelectric material to be suitable for use in thermoelectric devices, it is necessary for the ZT value to be equal to or greater than 1. ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) exhibits promising potential for applications in thermoelectric (TE) devices due to their ZT values, which remain above 1 across the whole temperature range. Based on the ZT values of ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca), it may be inferred that both compounds are effective thermoelectric material for usage in TE devices.

Scientists' fascination with thermoelectric (TE) materials has grown tremendously in response to the global energy problem. This section presents an analysis of the thermoelectric (TE) properties of ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca)in order to evaluate their suitability for use in TE devices. The thermoelectric properties of the chalcogenide materials ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are evaluated by employing the traditional Boltzmann kinetic transport theory and the rigid band approximation. In order to assess the thermoelectric (TE) properties of the compounds described above, it is necessary to utilize fundamental TE characteristics such as thermal conductivity q=-k dT dx, power factor (PF=\u03c3 SE^{2}), electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient S= \u0394V \u0394T, and figure of merit ZT= ST \u03c1\u03baE^{2}. The BoltzTraP package, which is based on semi-classical theory, is utilized to compute the temperature-dependent thermoelectric (TE) characteristics, assuming a relaxation time constant. The spectral characteristics of the TE parameters of ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are presented in (a\u2013e), covering a temperature range of 0 to 1000 K. Electrical conductivity (\u03c3) is a measure of a material's capacity to conduct electricity. The spectral characteristics of the \u03c3 for ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are presented in (a), covering a temperature range of 0 to 1000 K. It is observed that there are no peaks at the beginning (i.e., \u03c3=0), and then peaks for BaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15start to appear at around 500and 550 K, respectively. These temperatures are known as the threshold value of \u03c3. Following the threshold temperature, there is a noticeable exponential rise in the \u03c3 plots as temperature increase. The upward trend observed in the \u03c3 plots provide evidence of the semiconducting properties of ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca). The values of \u03c3 for CaBi4Ti4O15 are higher than those for BaBi4Ti4O15 across the whole temperature range.

Both lattice vibrations and electrons play an integral part in the amount of heat conductivity (\u03ba) that semiconductors exhibit.The thermal conductivity \u03ba can be determined using Fourier's law. The spectral characteristics of the \u03ba for ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are presented in (b), covering a temperature range of 0 to 1000 K. It is observed that there are no peaks at the beginning (i.e., \u03ba=0), and then peaks for BaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15 start to appear at around 550 and 600 K, respectively. These temperatures are known as the threshold value of \u03ba. Following the threshold temperature, there is a noticeable exponential rise in the \u03ba plots as temperature increase.The reason for the increase in \u03ba at room temperature is that the wavelength of the phonons is greater than the size of the crystal boundary. All phonon contributions to \u03ba are either equal to or smaller than the crystal boundary. Moreover, the values of \u03ba for CaBi4Ti4O15 are higher than those for BaBi4Ti4O15 across the whole temperature range.

An electric potential difference (\u0394V) is generated as electrons migrate from a region of greater temperature to a region of lower temperature, driven by a temperature gradient made by connecting two different materials. The thermocouple's efficiency can be determined by calculating the Seebeck coefficient, which is the ratio of \u0394V to \u0394T.

The spectral characteristics of the PF for ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are presented in (d), covering a temperature range of 0 to 1000 K. It is observed that there are no peaks at the beginning (i.e., PF=0), and then peaks for BaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15start to appear at around 500and 550 K, respectively. These temperatures are known as the threshold value of PF. Once the threshold temperature is reached, a noticeable exponential rise in PF plots become apparent as temperatures continue to grow. The maximum thermal power factors (PF) for BaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15are \xd7E^{2.71}E^{10}E^{10} and \xd7 W m. K.sE^{2.91}E^{10}E^{10}E^{2}, respectively. The spectral characteristics of the ZT for ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are presented in (e), covering a temperature range of 0 to 1000 K.ZT plots are utilized to ascertain the thermoelectric efficiency of the materials under investigation. For both materials, the ZT values are initially around 1.0 and subsequently exhibit an exponential increase with increasing temperature. The maximum ZT values forBaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15are1.43 and 1.36, respectively. For a thermoelectric material to be suitable for use in thermoelectric devices, it is necessary for the ZT value to be equal to or greater than 1. ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) exhibits promising potential for applications in thermoelectric (TE) devices due to their ZT values, which remain above 1 across the whole temperature range. Based on the ZT values of ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca), it may be inferred that both compounds are effective thermoelectric material for usage in TE devices.
