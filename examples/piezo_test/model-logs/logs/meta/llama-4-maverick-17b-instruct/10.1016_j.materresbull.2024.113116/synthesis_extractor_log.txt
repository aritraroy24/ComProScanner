PVDF powder of molecular weight 53,400 g/mol was brought from Sigma Aldrich. N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) was supplied by CDH. The details of the precursors and synthesis of barium calcium titanate, BCT3 (3 % Ca doped BT) can be found in our previous publication. PVDF-BCT composite films were prepared by using the solvent casting method followed by hot pressing. The pure and polymer-ceramic composite was prepared by dissolving 1.74 g of PVDF in 20 ml of N, N-dimethylformamide and the solution temperature was maintained at 60 \xb0C. 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 wt.% of BCT3 filler were added to this solution after four hours of mixing of PVDF in DMF. This solution was stirred by setting 500 rpm on the hot plate for an additional four hours. In a cleaned petri dish, this solution was cast and annealed in an oven at 100 \xb0C for 5 h. The obtained films were peeled off from the glass petri dish, cut into square pieces, and hot pressed at 100 \xb0C by applying 125 kg/cmE^{2} pressure. The PVDF-BCT3 composite films were hot pressed in order to reduce pores and enhance the polar beta phase. The dielectric and ferroelectric measurements were conducted by cutting the films into a square shape of 1 \xd7 1 cmE^{2}. A square shape of 2 \xd7 2 cmE^{2} was cut to prepare the device for investing energy harvesting performance. An aluminium electrode of 1.8 \xd7 1.8 cmE^{2} was applied at the top and bottom of the piezoelectric film. This entire system is enclosed with Kapton tape to protect the PEG from physical damage and prevent the contribution of electrostatic charge while checking device performance. Confirmation of the formation of the composite structure was carried out using an X-ray diffractometer of the PANalytical model Xpert Pro. The morphology, chemical composition, and elemental mapping of pure PVDF and PVDF-BCT3 composite films were investigated using field emission scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (FESEM-EDX) of Zeiss, make SUPRA GEMINI. The filament of the FESEM instrument was operated at 5 kV. The content of the polar beta phase was determined by conducting Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) with Alpha II, Bruker spectrometer. HIOKI IM3570 was used for performing the frequency-dependent dielectric measurements at room temperature. The investigation of the ferroelectric performance of the composite films was done using the polarization vs. electric field (PE) hysteresis tracer manufactured by Marine India. Poling was done by applying a DC electric field of 100 kV/cm before conducting the PE measurements. The poling duration was kept constant for 1 h for all the films. A digital storage oscilloscope of Scientific SMO1002 was used for measuring the piezoelectric voltage generated by hand-tapping the films. The force-dependent voltage and current measurements were carried out using an electrometer of Keithley with number 6517B. Room-temperature absorbance measurements of PVDF-BCT3 composite films were investigated in a wavelength range of 200\u2013800 nm using an Agilent Cary UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the PVDF-BCT3 composite films has been recorded and depicted in. The XRD peaks at 22\xb0, 31\xb0, 39\xb0, 45\xb0, 51\xb0, 56\xb0, 66\xb0, 71\xb0, 75\xb0, and 79\xb0 with Miller indices (100), (110), (111), (002), (210), (211), (220), (221), (310), and (311), respectively belong to the BCT3 ceramic. The peak at 39.6\xb0 belongs to the alpha phase configuration of the polymeric PVDF chain. The peak located at 36.9\xb0 confirms the presence of the beta phase of (200) crystal plane of PVDF. Because of the addition of filler in PVDF matrix, the intensity of above two peaks decreases. The peak at 19.13\xb0 belongs to the alpha phase while the other peak at 20.6\xb0 represents the beta polymorph of the PVDF chain. Initially, for lesser filler content (<20 wt.%) in the polymer matrix, the intensity of peaks at 19.13\xb0 and 20.6\xb0 is higher. The intensity of both of these peaks diminishes when filler content raises more than 20 wt.%. The rise in filler content suppresses the intensity of polymorphs of PVDF in the composite films. This happens due to the dominance of BCT3 over PVDF because of its increasing wt.%. Here, in our case, there is almost no shift in the 2\u03b8 position of 19.13 and 20.6\xb0 peak. The presence of diffraction planes of BCT3 along with polymorphs of PVDF confirms the formation of PVDF-BCT3 composite films. Its content is determined by performing FTIR spectroscopy. Here, FTIR spectroscopy of the composite films is measured in the range of 600 to 1800 cmE^{\u22121} and is shown in (a). The presence of alpha, beta, and gamma phases is confirmed through FTIR spectroscopy. The FTIR peaks at 763, 806, 1382, and 1433 cmE^{\u22121} symbolises the alpha polymorph of PVDF. The peak at 1228 cmE^{\u22121} represents the gamma phase of PVDF and the peaks at 840 and 1274 cmE^{\u22121} represent the beta phase of PVDF. In (b), it has been observed that peaks at 1019 and 1049 cmE^{\u22121} become more prominent with raising BCT3 filler content beyond 20 wt.%. In some reports, the particular bond at 1019 cmE^{\u22121} is assigned to CH bending modes while in others it is assigned to COC stretching mode. This COC bond is generally formed by the aging of polymers which may be natural or artificial. In the present case, since no aging has been done, so this peak belongs to CH bending modes which have become more activated with increasing BCT3 filler content in the PVDF matrix. The other FTIR peak at 1049 cmE^{\u22121} is assigned to the MOM (where M stands for metal) bond of BCT3 filler. The intensity of both these peaks increases with the incorporation of more BCT3 in the PVDF matrix. The content of the polar \u03b2 phase, F(\u03b2) is calculated by using the Lambert-Beer formula as follows where A\u03b1 and A\u03b2 are the absorbance intensity of \u03b1 and \u03b2 phase corresponding to the wavenumber 763 and 840 cmE^{\u22121}, respectively. It is observed that as the BCT3 filler wt.% in PVDF increases the content of polar \u03b2 phase also increases. The calculated F(\u03b2) values are 75.00, 77.30, 80.92, 83.76, 86.90, and 81.09 for PVDF, PVDF-BCT3-10, PVDF-BCT3-20, PVDF-BCT3-30, PVDF-BCT3-40, and PVDF-BCT3-50 composite films, respectively ((c)). Therefore, BCT3 ceramic filler helps in increasing the \u03b2 content in the PVDF matrix. The morphology of PVDF-BCT3 composite films has been investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). (a) and (b) show the micrograph of PVDF and PVDF-BCT3-40 (40 wt.% of BCT3), respectively. In the case of PVDF-BCT3-40, agglomeration of BCT3 filler can be seen. Though agglomerated, the distribution of these agglomerated clusters of BCT3 filler is uniform in the polymer matrix. It is not such that all the BCT3 fillers are occupied at one location in the PVDF-BCT3 film and this agglomeration might have happened due to the rise in filler content i.e., 40 wt.%. (c) and (d) represent the EDX spectrum of the elements of PVDF and PVDF-BCT3-40 films, respectively. Because of the lower atomic number of hydrogen atoms, they cannot be detected by EDX spectroscopy. The elemental color mapping of the components presented in PVDF-BCT3-40 film i.e., C, F, Ba, Ca, Ti, and O has also been taken and is depicted in (e)\u2013(j). The EDX spectrum shows the uniform distribution of all the elements in the composite film. The dielectric constant (\u03b5\u2032) of ceramics is generally very high, but it is lower in the case of polymers. The composite film is coated with silver paste before the electrical characterization. (b) depicts the dipole moment originating in the composite film involving (i) the individual contribution of BCT3 and PVDF and (ii) the interfacial polarization at their grain boundaries. The dielectric performance of PVDF-BCT3 composite films is carried out in the frequency range of 1 kHz to 1 MHz as depicted in (c) and (d). The \u03b5\u2032 of pristine PVDF is 6 at 1 kHz frequency which rises to 16 for PVDF-BCT3-40 (40 wt.% BCT3). With further rise in filler concentration to 50 wt.%, \u03b5\u2032 reduces to 13. There is an increase in dielectric loss with rising wt.% of BCT3 in the PVDF matrix. Rise in BCT3 filler to 50 wt.% may cause more agglomeration leading to leakage current which further lowers its dielectric constant. The initial increase in dielectric constant with BCT3 wt.% (up to 40 wt.%) in PVDF is due to a rise in Maxwell\u2013Wagner\u2013Siller polarization. As the frequency increases, interfacial polarization vanishes urging the decreases in \u03b5\u2032 value. The tan \u03b4 for PVDF, PVDF-BCT3-10, PVDF-BCT3-20, PVDF-BCT3-30, PVDF-BCT3-40, and PVDF-BCT3-50 are 0.026, 0.029, 0.033, 0.035, 0.037, and 0.058, respectively, at 1 kHz. Tan \u03b4 value suddenly rises after 10E^{4} Hz frequency which happens due to the relaxation of dipoles corresponding to the fast-changing field. All the PVDF-BCT3 composite films were polled for an hour by supplying a DC electric field of 100 kV/cm in order to orient dipoles in the applied field direction. The PE hysteresis loop is traced by applying a sinusoidal wave of 50 Hz frequency. It is observed that while increasing the applied electric field from 30 to 250 kV/cm, the remnant polarization (Pr), saturation polarization (PS), as well as the coercive field (Ec) increase for PVDF as shown in (a). The comparative PE hysteresis loop for PVDF-BCT3-10, PVDF-BCT3-20, PVDF-BCT3-30, PVDF-BCT3-40, and PVDF-BCT3-50 for 250 kV/cm of applied electric field is shown in (b). The variation in Pr, PS, and Ec values concerning BCT3 content in PVDF is shown in (c). A rise in Pr and PS is observed with increases in BCT3 filler content from 0 to 40 wt.%, and after this, their values decline. However, the Ec value initially decreases for PVDF-BCT3-10, and after this rises till PVDF-BCT3-40 and then decreases ((c)). This observed behavior may be because of the chain orientation of the PVDF polymer. The addition of more BCT3 filler till 40 wt.% has contributed to MWS interfacial polarization resulting in a rise in Pr and PS value. However, maybe filler agglomeration which raises the tan \u03b4 for PVDF-BCT3-50 as discussed above has lowered its Pr, PS, and Ec values. The Pr value of PVDF, PVDF-BCT3-10, PVDF-BCT3-20, PVDF-BCT3-30, PVDF-BCT3-40, and PVDF-BCT3-50 is 0.17, 0.43, 0.45, 0.48, 0.52, and 0.46 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, respectively, @250 kV/cm applied field. The energy storage density (Wtot), recoverable energy density (Wrec), and energy storage efficiency (\u03b7) are calculated by using the formula given where Wloss is the energy density that is lost after the electric field is removed. E is the applied electric field, P is the polarization and Pmax is the saturation polarization. (d) and (e) show the change of Wtot and Wrec for PVDF, PVDF-BCT3-10, PVDF-BCT3-20, PVDF-BCT3-30, PVDF-BCT3-40, and PVDF-BCT3-50 with the applied electric field. Similar to Pr and PS, the values of Wtot and Wrec rise until 40 wt.% of BCT3 and later decrease for all the applied electric fields. is used to calculate Wtot whose value is 97.87, 248.9, 257.8, 265.8, 284.7, and 260.8 mJ/cmE^{3} @250 kV/cm for PVDF, PVDF-BCT3-10, PVDF-BCT3-20, PVDF-BCT3-30, PVDF-BCT3-40, and PVDF-BCT3-50, respectively. (f) shows the change in \u03b7 with varying BCT3 content from 0 to 50 wt.% in the PVDF matrix at different applied electric fields. For PVDF-BCT3 composite films, \u03b7 ranges from 45 to 58 % and is consistent with previously reported values. The particulars of the fabrication of a piezoelectric generator (PEG) are discussed in the device fabrication section. An effective area of 1.8 \xd7 1.8 cmE^{2} was kept fixed for all the films. When the PEG is pressed, a potential difference is created at the opposite electrodes due to charge separation in dipoles or their orientation. After the force is removed from PEG, the dipoles start to regain their equilibrium position resulting in a negative peak corresponding to voltage/current. The peak-to-peak voltage (VP-P) generated by attaching a resistance varying from 10E^{1} \u03a9 to 10E^{7} \u03a9 connected parallelly to PVDF-BCT3-40 is depicted in (a). Initially, with the increase in resistance, the output piezo voltage rises from 8.36 to 31.8 V and then decreases with a further increase in resistance. This happens because of impedance matching between the circuit resistance with that of PEG. The voltage and VP-P generated from PVDF, PVDF-BCT3-10, PVDF-BCT3-20, PVDF-BCT3-30, PVDF-BCT3-40, and PVDF-BCT3-50 across 0.1 M\u03a9 resistance is shown in (b) and (c), respectively. An increase in piezo voltage is observed till 40 wt.% of BCT3 in the PVDF matrix. For PVDF-BCT3-50, voltage drops and may the agglomeration of filler because of more filler content results in such behavior. This observed behavior is matching with the results of dielectric and FTIR analysis. The voltage generated when PVDF-BCT3-40 film is connected in forward and reverse connection is depicted in (d). An equal amount of voltage is generated in both cases. (e) illustrates the piezo voltage generated of 7.5 V, 12.0 V, and 4.8 V upon hand-tapping, fist beating, and elbow bending, respectively for PVDF-BCT3-40 film (without resistance). PEGs developed in this work are appropriate for use as self-powered devices because they produce voltage when force is applied to them, and this voltage varies according to changes in the human body posture. In this work, three methods are used to assess the PVDF-BCT3 composite films' ability to harvest energy: (i) adjusting resistance in parallel to the PEG, (ii) exerting force on the films by altering various human body postures, such as elbow folding, hand tapping, and fist beating, and (iii) adjusting applied force of 10 N, 30 N, and 50 N at 5 Hz cyclic frequency. In case (iii), a handcrafted device based on a stepper motor functioning with a cyclic frequency of 5 Hz is employed to impart force on the PEG. The schematic illustration of stepper-motor based piezoelectric energy harvesting setup is shown in (a). (b) and (c) illustrate the VP-P and peak-to-peak current (IP-P) generated when a constant force of 10, 30, and 50 N is imparted on the PVDF-BCT3 composite films. It is observed that as the load increases from 10 N to 50 N, the output voltage, current, and power density also increase for each film. The output voltage and current generated by applying a mechanical force of 50 N @5 Hz frequency for PVDF-BCT3 composite films are depicted in (d) and (e). For a particular applied mechanical force at a fixed cyclic frequency, the piezo voltage and current rise with the addition of filler wt.% in the PVDF matrix. The highest voltage and current with values of 25 V and 26.8 nA, respectively are obtained for PVDF-BCT3-40. Maybe the accumulation of filler with 50 wt.% of BCT3 leads to the deterioration of piezo performance for PVDF-BCT3-50. This result matches well with the FTIR and dielectric results. The power density is calculated using the formula V\xd7I A\xd7t, where A is the effective area and t is the thickness of the composite films. The altering of power density with BCT3 content and mechanical load is depicted in (f). The pattern of variation of power density is similar to that of voltage and current for PVDF-BCT3 composite films. Therefore, the content of BCT3 plays a significant role in shaping the performance of composite films. The power density PVDF-BCT3-40 is 19.8 \u03bcW/cmE^{3} for 50 N applied mechanical force. (g) shows the stability of PVDF-BCT3-40 films, which have been tested through 2000 cycles of force loading and unloading (50 N). The output voltage does not decrease over the course of 2000 cycles, indicating better stability of the composite film. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with a total of six are illuminated by the voltage produced by PVDF-BCT3-40 film (@ 50 N) as shown in (h). Hence, low-power gadgets may be able to be fueled by the energy produced by these films. illustrates the comparison of the PVDF-BCT3 composite films' outcomes with previously released information. PVDF-BCT3-40 film was able to successfully generate an output voltage of 33.8 V across 0.1 M\u03a9 resistance. Upon the mechanical force loading with 50 N, the highest voltage, current, and power density obtained are 25 V, 26.8 nA, and 19.8 \u03bcW/cmE^{3}, respectively. Since the prepared films can detect human body postures and mechanical load, they can actively be used for biosensing and mechanical sensing/pressure sensing. (a) shows the absorbance vs. wavelength plot of PVDF, PVDF-BCT3-10, PVDF-BCT3-20, PVDF-BCT3-30, PVDF-BCT3-40, and PVDF-BCT3-50 films. A hump is observed in the region 300 to 600 nm and its broadening increases with BCT3 content in PVDF. This behavior is associated with the molecular interaction of BCT3 filler with the polymeric PVDF chain. BCT3 ceramic is prepared by doing the modification in the solid-state reaction route. The electronegative fluorine atom forms a bond between this hydroxyl group and PVDF  causing the extension of light absorption in the observed range. It has been observed that the absorbance increases with the rise in BCT3 filler content in PVDF. Additionally, since the absorbance increases with BCT3 wt.% as shown in (a), therefore these films have the potential to be used for UV shielding and photocatalysis applications. The bandgap of PVDF-BCT3 composite films is calculated by using the Tauc plot  as given as where h\u03bd is the energy of the incident photon and Eg is the bandgap of the material under investigation. A is a constant and \u03b1 is the absorption coefficient of the material. n value varies for materials having direct or indirect bandgap. Here we are considering the indirect bandgap of the composite film for which n = 2 is used in the above Eqn. The Eg of PVDF, PVDF-BCT3-10, PVDF-BCT3-20, PVDF-BCT3-30, PVDF-BCT3-40, and PVDF-BCT3-50 is 4.58, 4.03, 4.03, 3.98, 3.22, and 3.18 eV ((b)\u2013(g)). The standard deviation values in the bandgap of PVDF, PVDF-BCT3-10, PVDF-BCT3-20, PVDF-BCT3-30, PVDF-BCT3-40, and PVDF-BCT3-50 are 0.040, 0.035, 0.032, 0.045, 0.065, and 0.047 eV, respectively. The bandgap is approximately the same for PVDF-BCT3-10, PVDF-BCT3-20, and PVDF-BCT3-30. The bandgap decreases with the addition of BCT3 filler in the PVDF matrix as illustrated in (h).

Though agglomerated, the distribution of these agglomerated clusters of BCT3 filler is uniform in the polymer matrix. It is not such that all the BCT3 fillers are occupied at one location in the PVDF-BCT3 film and this agglomeration might have happened due to the rise in filler content i.e., 40 wt.%. (c) and (d) represent the EDX spectrum of the elements of PVDF and PVDF-BCT3-40 films, respectively. Because of the lower atomic number of hydrogen atoms, they cannot be detected by EDX spectroscopy. The elemental color mapping of the components presented in PVDF-BCT3-40 film i.e., C, F, Ba, Ca, Ti, and O has also been taken and is depicted in (e)\u2013(j). The EDX spectrum shows the uniform distribution of all the elements in the composite film. The dielectric constant (\u03b5\u2032) of ceramics is generally very high, but it is lower in the case of polymers. The composite film is coated with silver paste before the electrical characterization. (b) depicts the dipole moment originating in the composite film involving (i) the individual contribution of BCT3 and PVDF and (ii) the interfacial polarization at their grain boundaries. The dielectric performance of PVDF-BCT3 composite films is carried out in the frequency range of 1 kHz to 1 MHz as depicted in (c) and (d). The \u03b5\u2032 of pristine PVDF is 6 at 1 kHz frequency which rises to 16 for PVDF-BCT3-40 (40 wt.% BCT3). With further rise in filler concentration to 50 wt.%, \u03b5\u2032 reduces to 13. There is an increase in dielectric loss with rising wt.% of BCT3 in the PVDF matrix. Rise in BCT3 filler to 50 wt.% may cause more agglomeration leading to leakage current which further lowers its dielectric constant. The initial increase in dielectric constant with BCT3 wt.% (up to 40 wt.%) in PVDF is due to a rise in Maxwell\u2013Wagner\u2013Siller polarization. As the frequency increases, interfacial polarization vanishes urging the decreases in \u03b5\u2032 value. The tan \u03b4 for PVDF, PVDF-BCT3-10, PVDF-BCT3-20, PVDF-BCT3-30, PVDF-BCT3-40, and PVDF-BCT3-50 are 0.026, 0.029, 0.033, 0.035, 0.037, and 0.058, respectively, at 1 kHz. Tan \u03b4 value suddenly rises after 10E^{4} Hz frequency which happens due to the relaxation of dipoles corresponding to the fast-changing field. All the PVDF-BCT3 composite films were polled for an hour by supplying a DC electric field of 100 kV/cm in order to orient dipoles in the applied field direction. The PE hysteresis loop is traced by applying a sinusoidal wave of 50 Hz frequency. It is observed that while increasing the applied electric field from 30 to 250 kV/cm, the remnant polarization (Pr), saturation polarization (PS), as well as the coercive field (Ec) increase for PVDF as shown in (a). The comparative PE hysteresis loop for PVDF-BCT3-10, PVDF-BCT3-20, PVDF-BCT3-30, PVDF-BCT3-40, and PVDF-BCT3-50 for 250 kV/cm of applied electric field is shown in (b). The variation in Pr, PS, and Ec values concerning BCT3 content in PVDF is shown in (c). A rise in Pr and PS is observed with increases in BCT3 filler content from 0 to 40 wt.%, and after this, their values decline. However, the Ec value initially decreases for PVDF-BCT3-10, and after this rises till PVDF-BCT3-40 and then decreases ((c)). This observed behavior may be because of the chain orientation of the PVDF polymer. The addition of more BCT3 filler till 40 wt.% has contributed to MWS interfacial polarization resulting in a rise in Pr and PS value. However, maybe filler agglomeration which raises the tan \u03b4 for PVDF-BCT3-50 as discussed above has lowered its Pr, PS, and Ec values. The Pr value of PVDF, PVDF-BCT3-10, PVDF-BCT3-20, PVDF-BCT3-30, PVDF-BCT3-40, and PVDF-BCT3-50 is 0.17, 0.43, 0.45, 0.48, 0.52, and 0.46 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, respectively, @250 kV/cm applied field. The energy storage density (Wtot), recoverable energy density (Wrec), and energy storage efficiency (\u03b7) are calculated by using the formula given where Wloss is the energy density that is lost after the electric field is removed. E is the applied electric field, P is the polarization and Pmax is the saturation polarization. (d) and (e) show the change of Wtot and Wrec for PVDF, PVDF-BCT3-10, PVDF-BCT3-20, PVDF-BCT3-30, PVDF-BCT3-40, and PVDF-BCT3-50 with the applied electric field. Similar to Pr and PS, the values of Wtot and Wrec rise until 40 wt.% of BCT3 and later decrease for all the applied electric fields. is used to calculate Wtot whose value is 97.87, 248.9, 257.8, 265.8, 284.7, and 260.8 mJ/cmE^{3} @250 kV/cm for PVDF, PVDF-BCT3-10, PVDF-BCT3-20, PVDF-BCT3-30, PVDF-BCT3-40, and PVDF-BCT3-50, respectively. (f) shows the change in \u03b7 with varying BCT3 content from 0 to 50 wt.% in the PVDF matrix at different applied electric fields. For PVDF-BCT3 composite films, \u03b7 ranges from 45 to 58 % and is consistent with previously reported values. The particulars of the fabrication of a piezoelectric generator (PEG) are discussed in the device fabrication section. An effective area of 1.8 \xd7 1.8 cmE^{2} was kept fixed for all the films. When the PEG is pressed, a potential difference is created at the opposite electrodes due to charge separation in dipoles or their orientation. After the force is removed from PEG, the dipoles start to regain their equilibrium position resulting in a negative peak corresponding to voltage/current. The peak-to-peak voltage (VP-P) generated by attaching a resistance varying from 10E^{1} \u03a9 to 10E^{7} \u03a9 connected parallelly to PVDF-BCT3-40 is depicted in (a). Initially, with the increase in resistance, the output piezo voltage rises from 8.36 to 31.8 V and then decreases with a further increase in resistance. This happens because of impedance matching between the circuit resistance with that of PEG. The voltage and VP-P generated from PVDF, PVDF-BCT3-10, PVDF-BCT3-20, PVDF-BCT3-30, PVDF-BCT3-40, and PVDF-BCT3-50 across 0.1 M\u03a9 resistance is shown in (b) and (c), respectively. An increase in piezo voltage is observed till 40 wt.% of BCT3 in the PVDF matrix. For PVDF-BCT3-50, voltage drops and may the agglomeration of filler because of more filler content results in such behavior. This observed behavior is matching with the results of dielectric and FTIR analysis. The voltage generated when PVDF-BCT3-40 film is connected in forward and reverse connection is depicted in (d). An equal amount of voltage is generated in both cases. (e) illustrates the piezo voltage generated of 7.5 V, 12.0 V, and 4.8 V upon hand-tapping, fist beating, and elbow bending, respectively for PVDF-BCT3-40 film (without resistance). PEGs developed in this work are appropriate for use as self-powered devices because they produce voltage when force is applied to them, and this voltage varies according to changes in the human body posture. In this work, three methods are used to assess the PVDF-BCT3 composite films' ability to harvest energy: (i) adjusting resistance in parallel to the PEG, (ii) exerting force on the films by altering various human body postures, such as elbow folding, hand tapping, and fist beating, and (iii) adjusting applied force of 10 N, 30 N, and 50 N at 5 Hz cyclic frequency. In case (iii), a handcrafted device based on a stepper motor functioning with a cyclic frequency of 5 Hz is employed to impart force on the PEG. The schematic illustration of stepper-motor based piezoelectric energy harvesting setup is shown in (a). (b) and (c) illustrate the VP-P and peak-to-peak current (IP-P) generated when a constant force of 10, 30, and 50 N is imparted on the PVDF-BCT3 composite films. It is observed that as the load increases from 10 N to 50 N, the output voltage, current, and power density also increase for each film. The output voltage and current generated by applying a mechanical force of 50 N @5 Hz frequency for PVDF-BCT3 composite films are depicted in (d) and (e). For a particular applied mechanical force at a fixed cyclic frequency, the piezo voltage and current rise with the addition of filler wt.% in the PVDF matrix. The highest voltage and current with values of 25 V and 26.8 nA, respectively are obtained for PVDF-BCT3-40. Maybe the accumulation of filler with 50 wt.% of BCT3 leads to the deterioration of piezo performance for PVDF-BCT3-50. This result matches well with the FTIR and dielectric results. The power density is calculated using the formula V\xd7I A\xd7t, where A is the effective area and t is the thickness of the composite films. The altering of power density with BCT3 content and mechanical load is depicted in (f). The pattern of variation of power density is similar to that of voltage and current for PVDF-BCT3 composite films. Therefore, the content of BCT3 plays a significant role in shaping the performance of composite films. The power density PVDF-BCT3-40 is 19.8 \u03bcW/cmE^{3} for 50 N applied mechanical force. (g) shows the stability of PVDF-BCT3-40 films, which have been tested through 2000 cycles of force loading and unloading (50 N). The output voltage does not decrease over the course of 2000 cycles, indicating better stability of the composite film. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with a total of six are illuminated by the voltage produced by PVDF-BCT3-40 film (@ 50 N) as shown in (h). Hence, low-power gadgets may be able to be fueled by the energy produced by these films. illustrates the comparison of the PVDF-BCT3 composite films' outcomes with previously released information. PVDF-BCT3-40 film was able to successfully generate an output voltage of 33.8 V across 0.1 M\u03a9 resistance. Upon the mechanical force loading with 50 N, the highest voltage, current, and power density obtained are 25 V, 26.8 nA, and 19.8 \u03bcW/cmE^{3}, respectively. Since the prepared films can detect human body postures and mechanical load, they can actively be used for biosensing and mechanical sensing/pressure sensing. (a) shows the absorbance vs. wavelength plot of PVDF, PVDF-BCT3-10, PVDF-BCT3-20, PVDF-BCT3-30, PVDF-BCT3-40, and PVDF-BCT3-50 films. A hump is observed in the region 300 to 600 nm and its broadening increases with BCT3 content in PVDF. This behavior is associated with the molecular interaction of BCT3 filler with the polymeric PVDF chain. BCT3 ceramic is prepared by doing the modification in the solid-state reaction route. The electronegative fluorine atom forms a bond between this hydroxyl group and PVDF  causing the extension of light absorption in the observed range. It has been observed that the absorbance increases with the rise in BCT3 filler content in PVDF. Additionally, since the absorbance increases with BCT3 wt.% as shown in (a), therefore these films have the potential to be used for UV shielding and photocatalysis applications. The bandgap of PVDF-BCT3 composite films is calculated by using the Tauc plot  as given as where h\u03bd is the energy of the incident photon and Eg is the bandgap of the material under investigation. A is a constant and \u03b1 is the absorption coefficient of the material. n value varies for materials having direct or indirect bandgap. Here we are considering the indirect bandgap of the composite film for which n = 2 is used in the above Eqn. The Eg of PVDF, PVDF-BCT3-10, PVDF-BCT3-20, PVDF-BCT3-30, PVDF-BCT3-40, and PVDF-BCT3-50 is 4.58, 4.03, 4.03, 3.98, 3.22, and 3.18 eV ((b)\u2013(g)). The standard deviation values in the bandgap of PVDF, PVDF-BCT3-10, PVDF-BCT3-20, PVDF-BCT3-30, PVDF-BCT3-40, and PVDF-BCT3-50 are 0.040, 0.035, 0.032, 0.045, 0.065, and 0.047 eV, respectively. The bandgap is approximately the same for PVDF-BCT3-10, PVDF-BCT3-20, and PVDF-BCT3-30. The bandgap decreases with the addition of BCT3 filler in the PVDF matrix as illustrated in (h).

   - Casting the solution into a cleaned petri dish.
   - Annealing the cast solution in an oven at 100°C for 5 hours.
   - Peeling off the obtained films from the petri dish, cutting them into square pieces.
   - Hot pressing the film pieces at 100°C by applying 125 kg/cm² pressure.

4. **Characterization Techniques**: The characterization techniques used include:
   - X-ray diffractometer (XRD) for confirming the formation of the composite structure.
   - Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (FESEM-EDX) for investigating morphology, chemical composition, and elemental mapping.
