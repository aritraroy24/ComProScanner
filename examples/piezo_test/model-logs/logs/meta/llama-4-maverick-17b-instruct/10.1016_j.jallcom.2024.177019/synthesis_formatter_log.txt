Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'solid-state reaction', 'precursors': ['Nd2O3', 'Bi2O3', 'Sc2O3', 'PbO', 'TiO2'], 'steps': ['Ball milling of the powders in ethanol with zirconia balls for 24 h', 'Drying in the oven', 'Calcination at 850 °C for 3 h', 'Additional 12 h ball milling process in ethanol', 'Drying and granulating by adding 5 wt% polyvinyl alcohol', 'Sieving through an 80-mesh screen', 'Uniaxially dry pressing powder mixtures into samples', 'Sintering at temperatures between 1120 and 1200 °C for 2 h in an ambient air atmosphere after removing the binder at 550 °C'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'SEM', 'd33 meter', 'Ferroelectric analyzer', 'LCR meter']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
