# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
To the authors\u2019 knowledge, this study was the first to examine the synthesis and characterization\u2014gelation time, swelling and degradation, rheology, as well as micromorphological and topographical analyses\u2014of hybrid scaffolds made from MeHA and KNN in contrast to MeHA alone scaffolds. In this study, the SEM images showed that KNN exhibits cuboid grain structures ( A-D). The EDX findings showed a uniform distribution of elements, as shown in A. The phase of KNN was analyzed using XRD, which ascertained the presence of the typical pattern of secondary phases, as shown by small peaks detected at around 27\u201328\xb0C, which have been verified using the International Crystallographic Database (ICDD) with JCPDS card number 076\u20130977. illustrated the XRD pattern of K0.5Na0.5NbO3 powder that has undergone calcination at a temperature of 801.5 \xbaC for a duration of 4 h. This secondary phase is produced during solid-state sintering, which includes one or more calcinations at around 800 \xbaC, followed by sintering at roughly 1120 \xbaC. The issue stems from the limited sintering range of KNN, usually between 1100 and 1140\xb0C, which falls below the solidus temperature of 1150\xb0C. However, KNN possesses a piezoelectric coefficient (d 33 ) that exceed those seen in biological tissues. A previous study has shown that an electric field strength of 24 pC/N efficiently enhances the rate of bone defect repair in vivo. Additionally, an electric field strength ranging from 1 to 100 mV/cm was found to promote the osteogenesis. The KNN used in this study has a d 33 value of 94 \xb1 4 pC/N, as determined by the Berlincourt technique using a Sinocera YE2730A Berlincourt d 33 meter, and 69.3 \xb1 8.6 pC/N ascertained using the converse measurements. Thus, the KNN ceramics produced in this study possess a sufficient d 33 for potential biological applications. The volume distribution for the calcined powder is shown in and the average particle size was determined to be 0.65 \u03bcm. This heterogeneity of particle sizes may be attributed to the two-phase nature of the Nb2O5 precursor. Both orthorhombic and monoclinic Nb2O5 are present in the precursor powder and exhibit different milling behaviour. KNN that has been formed from orthorhombic Nb2O5 particles comprises the majority of the peak centred at 0.1 \u03bcm, whilst KNN from monoclinic Nb2O5 particles comprises the majority of the peak centred at 1 \u03bcm. This two-phase, bimodal precursor distribution also affects the reaction kinetics, causing orthorhombic-derived KNN to have excess sodium, and monoclinic-derived KNN to have excess potassium. These local stoichiometric heterogeneities further contribute to the formation of the aforementioned secondary phase K4Nb6O17. Zeta potential refers to the electric potential difference between the dispersion medium and the stationary layer of fluid that surrounds a dispersed particle; the term \u201crepulsion\u201d refers to the degree of aversion between adjacent particles with identical charges within a dispersion. In the present study, the KNN suspension exhibited a negative zeta potential of 19.6 mV at a pH of 7.4 for PBS, indicating some degree of stability. In this study, the low degree of modification ranging from 30 % to 40 % was employed to comprehend the fundamental characteristics of the tested parameters, especially those obtained from the hybrid scaffolds made of MeHA and KNN. The MeHA concentration was set at 4 % and the photoinitiator LAP was added to the gel solution in a 1:3 ratio for the photopolymerization process. The measured intensity was found to be one-third of the intensity provided by the manufacturer, which is 1200 mW/cmE^{2} and the same light source was used throughout the experiment. The total gel-forming time for MeHA alone scaffolds was 120 seconds; however, when combined with KNN, it was reduced to 80 seconds under the light intensity of 398 mW/cmE^{2}. The faster gelation time of hybrid scaffolds may be attributed to the high solubility of ions, resulting in a shorter duration for the rapid reaction to dissociate from KNN. In addition, the dissociated ions, such as sodium derived from KNN, may likely act as co-initiators, thereby reducing the gelation time. We also conducted a retrospective study to gain insights into the gelation time using the emitted light intensity (1100 mW/cmE^{2}), which closely matched the aforementioned manufacturer\u2019s specified intensity of 1200 mW/cmE^{2}. Upon retrospective confirmation, the intensity of 1100 mW/cmE^{2} was shown to be associated with the gelation time of 20 seconds for hybrid scaffolds, whereas the gelation time for MeHA alone scaffolds was 40 seconds. Hence, it is crucial to give priority to the assessment of the actual emitted light intensity rather than just relying on the initial intensity indicated by the manufacturer to fully comprehend the correlation between the emitted light intensity and gelation time, which affects the mechanical properties associated with the scaffolds\u2019 architecture, as well as to effectively interpret the obtained results. Having the correct pore size is an important parameter and if the pores were too minuscule, the cells would obstruct them, impeding cell penetration, the generation of ECM, and the formation of new blood vessels inside the scaffolds. It has been reported that the most suitable pore size for neovascularization is 5 \u03bcm , while the ideal pore size for fibroblast ingrowth ranges from 5 to 15 \u03bcm. For hepatocyte ingrowth, the optimal pore size is 20 \u03bcm. Adult mammalian skin regeneration requires pore sizes ranging from 20 to 125 \u03bcm , whereas osteoconduction necessitates pore sizes between 200 and 350 \u03bcm. The SEM micromorphological analysis of the present study showed an insignificant difference in pore sizes (P >.05). MeHA alone scaffolds had a mean pore size of 203.96 \u03bcm ( B), and hybrid scaffolds with KNN had a mean porous size of 156.9 \u03bcm ( D). Both MeHA alone and the hybrid scaffold samples had surfaces with tiny plateaus, but no significant holes or beads were found on the surfaces ( A and C). Light scatters across material interfaces , especially when hydrogel and KNN powder have different refractive indices. Light scattering increases with decreasing wavelength, and larger auxiliary particles, which are larger than 0.47 \u03bcm, cause light beams to scatter and deviate from their intended course. And thus, the particle size of the KNN powder and the wavelength of the light may potentially be the confounding factors in this study, indicating that the smaller particle size and longer wavelength be used. Another potential reason may be the disruption of dissociated ions from KNN to the crosslinking system. The pore structure of the investigated scaffold is only indicative of freeze-dried material, so SEM images do not accurately depict the functional microstructure of the hydrogel. In the present study, the roughness of the scaffolds\u2019 surfaces, as determined by the root mean square roughness (Rrms) values, was 52.67 nm for MeHA alone scaffolds and 10.8 nm for hybrid scaffolds that included KNN ( ). MeHA alone scaffolds also exhibited significant projections in comparison to the hybrid scaffolds. Although the exact mechanism generating a smoother surface in hybrid scaffolds is unclear, the dissociated cations from KNN may enhance the attractive force by binding to the negative end of water molecules in the hydrogel. Hydrogels with suitable mechanical properties have the potential to not only provide stabilization to the networking system when positioned between two separate hard-tissue structures but also to emulate characteristics of the natural ECM that influence cellular activities. Nevertheless, prior investigations have established that hydrogels based on HA undergo rapid biodegradation in vivo and lack appropriate mechanical stability, which is primarily attributed to the elevated hydrophilicity and subsequent swelling capacity of HA. And thus, HA-based hydrogel scaffolds should exhibit not only elevated regenerative potential and biocompatibility but also mechanical characteristics that are comparable to those of native physiological tissues. Significant differences were observed between the MeHA alone groups at 1 day and 1 week (.A), however the hybrid group at 2 weeks had a significantly lower value compared to the other hybrid groups (P <.05). The corresponding time intervals of the two scaffold types at 1 week and 2 weeks showed significant differences. The hybrid scaffolds exhibited a substantial greater swelling ratio at 1 week, whereas the HA alone scaffolds had a significantly higher swelling ratio at 2 weeks (P <.05), indicating the lower density of crosslinking. The pore size, which correspond to the mesh size between crosslinks, may contribute to the swelling ratio to some extent in this investigation; this phenomenon might be a result of the hydrogel\u2019s heightened capacity to absorb a greater amount of water. A substantial difference in volume change was only seen between MeHA groups at 1 week and 1 month (P <.05) (.B). The median and interquartile range (IQR) of the compressive strength for each of the experimental groups were shown in. The set of scaffolds, consisting of both types, had a significantly reduced compressive strength after 1 month immersed in PBS (P <.05). A substantial difference was observed between two types of scaffolds after 1 day (P <.05). The same pattern of reduced elastic modulus was also seen after a period of one month with significant difference (P <.05) ( ). There was no notable disparity in the elastic modulus between the two distinct types of scaffolds at the time points that were examined (P >.05). The results showed that compared to the 1-month group, the other groups had higher compressive strength and elastic modulus, with or without significant differences. This indicated that they were capable of withstanding deformation within a specific range of elastic strength or loads, therefore demonstrating the deterioration characteristics of the 1-month group. This may be because the addition of KNN could compensate for a certain degree of strength. In this study, amplitude sweep experiment was conducted to identify the linear viscoelastic region (LVR) or Newtonian behavior of the investigated scaffolds. The low shear stress conditions caused the hybrid scaffolds to develop LVR. The process demonstrated the dependence of the scaffolds\u2019 moduli on the increasing stress. The mean and standard error of the total storage modulus (G\u2032) and yield point (tan \u03b4) of the tested scaffolds were presented in A and C. The mean value of the total storage modulus (G\u2032) of MeHA alone scaffolds was 738.94 Pa, whereas the hybrid scaffolds had a much lower total mean value of 177.88 Pa. The inclusion of KNN impacted the yield points, which may be due to the solid content of KNN in the hybrid scaffolds and/or the disruption caused by KNN to the crosslinking system. To ascertain the correlation between the frequency of testing and the storage (G\u2032) and loss (G\u2032\u2032) moduli of a material, a frequency sweep was conducted. Additionally, it provides valuable information on the viscoelastic characteristics and condition of a material by comparing the values of G\u2032 and G\u2032\u2032 across different frequencies. The G\u2032 and G\u2032\u2032 values of the examined scaffolds exhibited a high degree of frequency independence, with the loss modulus being consistently larger than the storage modulus over the almost entire range of frequencies (Fig. 11 C and D). Both types of scaffolds had G\u2032 and G\u2032\u2032 values that were independent of the frequency; however, MeHA alone scaffolds showed a crossover point, indicating reversible crosslinking. The mean and standard error of the total storage modulus (G\u2032) and yield point (tan \u03b4) of the frequency sweep of the tested scaffolds were presented in B and D. MeHA alone scaffolds had an average total storage modulus (G\u2032) of 46181.94 Pa, whereas the hybrid scaffolds had a much higher average total value of 142381.9 Pa. The incorporation of KNN into MeHA hydrogel shows promise for biological application, although it causes the partial pore formation and affects the yield point of the rheological properties, which paves the way for further investigations, such as biocompatibility, cell proliferation and differentiation, using different degrees of modifications and cross-linking agents, as well as various KNN particle sizes, wavelengths, and compositions.

# TITLE
Synthesis and characterization of photopolymerizable piezoelectric KNN-based methacrylated hyaluronic acid hydrogel scaffolds

# ABSTRACT
The use of methacrylated hyaluronic acid hydrogel (MeHA) has tremendous promise for regeneration purposes, while potassium sodium niobate (KNN) exhibits biocompatibility properties that make it suitable for biomedical applications. This study examined the synthesis and characterization of hybrid scaffolds composed of MeHA and KNN. The investigation focused on various aspects, including gelation time, micromorphology, topographic analysis, swelling behavior, changes in volume and degradation profiles, as well as mechanical properties, compared to MeHA alone scaffolds, along with the synthesis and characterization of KNN. The findings demonstrated that the incorporation of KNN into MeHA influenced some properties, including shorter gelation time and partial pore development. Nevertheless, a few notable differences between hybrid scaffolds and MeHA alone scaffolds were observed, while there were no substantial disparities overall. As a result, integrating KNN into MeHA has the potential to lead to further investigation, such as biological testing using different degrees of modification of MeHA, crosslinking systems, and KNN with variable sizes and piezoelectricity.

# INTRODUCTION
Over the past two decades, tissue engineering has been developed to address the lack of organ and tissue donors for patients with illnesses or injuries; a variety of materials can serve as scaffolds, which function as synthetic extracellular matrix (ECM) , to create synthetic alternatives that facilitate cell adhesion and provide a favorable milieu for cell proliferation, organization, and ultimately tissue regeneration. These scaffolds play a crucial role in organizing cells into a three-dimensional (3D) structure and facilitating the presentation of cues that guide the growth and development of a desired tissue; the achievement of effective tissue regeneration relies fundamentally on the intricate interaction between the scaffold, cells, and bioactive signals. The main goal of using scaffolds is to mimic the characteristics present in the ECM of different human tissues. Besides, the natural 3D environment within hydrogels has the ability to accurately reflect the ECM of different tissues, as well as the distribution of cell ligands and nutrients. Multiple studies have shown that the extensive use of HA, including MeHA, has significant promise for various applications, including cancer therapy, regeneration, face correction, spinal fusion, dental disease management, and hemostasis. Hyaluronic acid (HA), which is a naturally sourced glycosaminoglycan that possesses properties such as non-immunogenicity, non-adhesiveness, and bioactivity, offers a distinctive set of benefits for biomaterial formulations. HA has been associated with several cellular processes, such as angiogenesis and inflammatory regulation, and plays a vital role in regulating cell adherence, migration, and differentiation through various binding proteins and cell-surface receptors, such as CD44. Chemical alterations can be made to three specific functional groups (the carboxylic acid of glucuronic acid, the primary and secondary hydroxyl groups, and the N-acetyl group) on a HA chain using reactive molecules such as acrylates, methacrylates, and maleimides. The utilization of methacrylate HA (MeHA) hydrogels has demonstrated an increase in rigidity and heightened resistance to deterioration when compared to non-derivatized HA hydrogels. These MeHA hydrogels also maintain a desirable level of biocompatibility. As a result, there has been significant interest in both natural and synthetic variations of HA within the realm of tissue engineering scaffolds in recent years. Potassium sodium niobate (K,Na)0.5NbO3, commonly known as KNN, is a lead-free piezoelectric material that may be used as a replacement for lead-based ferroelectric materials. While still in the early stages of examination, KNN-based ceramics exhibit potential properties as biomaterials compared to other piezoelectric materials due to their positive impact on biological responses, such as improved adhesion and proliferation of osteoblast-like or mesenchymal stem cells. In a prior investigation, hydrogel and ultra-porous scaffold composites were synthesized by using different proportions of HA, KNN, and chitosan. While all composites were shown to be biocompatible, samples containing 90 % KNN exhibited elevated metabolic activity in osteoblast-like MG-63 cells even without external stimulation. The formulation containing 1.26 g of KNN, 0.14 g of HA, and 30 mL of chitosan showed the highest antibacterial activity against the fungal strain C. albicans and S. aureus among all the formulations tested in the same study. Hence, the studies have shown that both hydrogel and KNN possess the ability to be used for diverse applications in the field of biomedicine. However, the impact of incorporating KNN into MeHA hydrogel scaffolds on their synthesis and characterization is yet unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the synthesis and characterization, including gelation time, swelling, degradation, rheology, micromorphological, and topographical analyses of hybrid scaffolds consisting of MeHA hydrogel and KNN, in contrast to scaffolds made solely of MeHA hydrogel, together with the synthesis and characterization of KNN powder. The hypothesis was that integrating KNN into MeHA hydrogel scaffolds provides comparable structural and mechanical properties as opposed to scaffolds made of MeHA hydrogel alone without significant differences.

# CONCLUSION
Under the experimental condition, this study showed that there were some notable changes between hybrid scaffolds and MeHA alone scaffolds. The characterized KNN ceramics in this study have a sufficient d 33 for potential biological uses. The hybrid scaffolds exhibited a gelation time that was 30 % shorter compared to the MeHA alone scaffolds. After a week, the hybrid scaffolds exhibited a much higher swelling ratio, and after two weeks, MeHA alone scaffolds had an even greater swelling ratio. After 1 month, the degradation profile exhibited significantly reduced compressive strength and elastic modulus compared to the fresh samples. The hybrid scaffolds developed LVR in response to low shear stress conditions. Both types of scaffolds displayed G\u2032 and G\u2032\u2032 values independent of frequency, while MeHA alone scaffolds showed a crossover point, suggesting reversible crosslinking.

The volume distribution for the calcined powder is shown in and the average particle size was determined to be 0.65 \u03bcm. This heterogeneity of particle sizes may be attributed to the two-phase nature of the Nb2O5 precursor. Both orthorhombic and monoclinic Nb2O5 are present in the precursor powder and exhibit different milling behaviour. KNN that has been formed from orthorhombic Nb2O5 particles comprises the majority of the peak centred at 0.1 \u03bcm, whilst KNN from monoclinic Nb2O5 particles comprises the majority of the peak centred at 1 \u03bcm. This two-phase, bimodal precursor distribution also affects the reaction kinetics, causing orthorhombic-derived KNN to have excess sodium, and monoclinic-derived KNN to have excess potassium. These local stoichiometric heterogeneities further contribute to the formation of the aforementioned secondary phase K4Nb6O17. Zeta potential refers to the electric potential difference between the dispersion medium and the stationary layer of fluid that surrounds a dispersed particle; the term \u201crepulsion\u201d refers to the degree of aversion between adjacent particles with identical charges within a dispersion. In the present study, the KNN suspension exhibited a negative zeta potential of 19.6 mV at a pH of 7.4 for PBS, indicating some degree of stability. In this study, the low degree of modification ranging from 30 % to 40 % was employed to comprehend the fundamental characteristics of the tested parameters, especially those obtained from the hybrid scaffolds made of MeHA and KNN. The MeHA concentration was set at 4 % and the photoinitiator LAP was added to the gel solution in a 1:3 ratio for the photopolymerization process. The measured intensity was found to be one-third of the intensity provided by the manufacturer, which is 1200 mW/cmE^{2} and the same light source was used throughout the experiment. The total gel-forming time for MeHA alone scaffolds was 120 seconds; however, when combined with KNN, it was reduced to 80 seconds under the light intensity of 398 mW/cmE^{2}. The faster gelation time of hybrid scaffolds may be attributed to the high solubility of ions, resulting in a shorter duration for the rapid reaction to dissociate from KNN. In addition, the dissociated ions, such as sodium derived from KNN, may likely act as co-initiators, thereby reducing the gelation time. We also conducted a retrospective study to gain insights into the gelation time using the emitted light intensity (1100 mW/cmE^{2}), which closely matched the aforementioned manufacturer\u2019s specified intensity of 1200 mW/cmE^{2}. Upon retrospective confirmation, the intensity of 1100 mW/cmE^{2} was shown to be associated with the gelation time of 20 seconds for hybrid scaffolds, whereas the gelation time for MeHA alone scaffolds was 40 seconds. Hence, it is crucial to give priority to the assessment of the actual emitted light intensity rather than just relying on the initial intensity indicated by the manufacturer to fully comprehend the correlation between the emitted light intensity and gelation time, which affects the mechanical properties associated with the scaffolds\u2019 architecture, as well as to effectively interpret the obtained results. Having the correct pore size is an important parameter and if the pores were too minuscule, the cells would obstruct them, impeding cell penetration, the generation of ECM, and the formation of new blood vessels inside the scaffolds. It has been reported that the most suitable pore size for neovascularization is 5 \u03bcm , while the ideal pore size for fibroblast ingrowth ranges from 5 to 15 \u03bcm. For hepatocyte ingrowth, the optimal pore size is 20 \u03bcm. Adult mammalian skin regeneration requires pore sizes ranging from 20 to 125 \u03bcm , whereas osteoconduction necessitates pore sizes between 200 and 350 \u03bcm. The SEM micromorphological analysis of the present study showed an insignificant difference in pore sizes (P >.05). MeHA alone scaffolds had a mean pore size of 203.96 \u03bcm ( B), and hybrid scaffolds with KNN had a mean porous size of 156.9 \u03bcm ( D). Both MeHA alone and the hybrid scaffold samples had surfaces with tiny plateaus, but no significant holes or beads were found on the surfaces ( A and C). Light scatters across material interfaces , especially when hydrogel and KNN powder have different refractive indices. Light scattering increases with decreasing wavelength, and larger auxiliary particles, which are larger than 0.47 \u03bcm, cause light beams to scatter and deviate from their intended course. And thus, the particle size of the KNN powder and the wavelength of the light may potentially be the confounding factors in this study, indicating that the smaller particle size and longer wavelength be used. Another potential reason may be the disruption of dissociated ions from KNN to the crosslinking system. The pore structure of the investigated scaffold is only indicative of freeze-dried material, so SEM images do not accurately depict the functional microstructure of the hydrogel. In the present study, the roughness of the scaffolds\u2019 surfaces, as determined by the root mean square roughness (Rrms) values, was 52.67 nm for MeHA alone scaffolds and 10.8 nm for hybrid scaffolds that included KNN ( ). MeHA alone scaffolds also exhibited significant projections in comparison to the hybrid scaffolds. Although the exact mechanism generating a smoother surface in hybrid scaffolds is unclear, the dissociated cations from KNN may enhance the attractive force by binding to the negative end of water molecules in the hydrogel. Hydrogels with suitable mechanical properties have the potential to not only provide stabilization to the networking system when positioned between two separate hard-tissue structures but also to emulate characteristics of the natural ECM that influence cellular activities. Nevertheless, prior investigations have established that hydrogels based on HA undergo rapid biodegradation in vivo and lack appropriate mechanical stability, which is primarily attributed to the elevated hydrophilicity and subsequent swelling capacity of HA. And thus, HA-based hydrogel scaffolds should exhibit not only elevated regenerative potential and biocompatibility but also mechanical characteristics that are comparable to those of native physiological tissues. Significant differences were observed between the MeHA alone groups at 1 day and 1 week (.A), however the hybrid group at 2 weeks had a significantly lower value compared to the other hybrid groups (P <.05). The corresponding time intervals of the two scaffold types at 1 week and 2 weeks showed significant differences. The hybrid scaffolds exhibited a substantial greater swelling ratio at 1 week, whereas the HA alone scaffolds had a significantly higher swelling ratio at 2 weeks (P <.05), indicating the lower density of crosslinking. The pore size, which correspond to the mesh size between crosslinks, may contribute to the swelling ratio to some extent in this investigation; this phenomenon might be a result of the hydrogel\u2019s heightened capacity to absorb a greater amount of water. A substantial difference in volume change was only seen between MeHA groups at 1 week and 1 month (P <.05) (.B). The median and interquartile range (IQR) of the compressive strength for each of the experimental groups were shown in. The set of scaffolds, consisting of both types, had a significantly reduced compressive strength after 1 month immersed in PBS (P <.05). A substantial difference was observed between two types of scaffolds after 1 day (P <.05). The same pattern of reduced elastic modulus was also seen after a period of one month with significant difference (P <.05) ( ). There was no notable disparity in the elastic modulus between the two distinct types of scaffolds at the time points that were examined (P >.05). The results showed that compared to the 1-month group, the other groups had higher compressive strength and elastic modulus, with or without significant differences. This indicated that they were capable of withstanding deformation within a specific range of elastic strength or loads, therefore demonstrating the deterioration characteristics of the 1-month group. This may be because the addition of KNN could compensate for a certain degree of strength. In this study, amplitude sweep experiment was conducted to identify the linear viscoelastic region (LVR) or Newtonian behavior of the investigated scaffolds. The low shear stress conditions caused the hybrid scaffolds to develop LVR. The process demonstrated the dependence of the scaffolds\u2019 moduli on the increasing stress. The mean and standard error of the total storage modulus (G\u2032) and yield point (tan \u03b4) of the tested scaffolds were presented in A and C. The mean value of the total storage modulus (G\u2032) of MeHA alone scaffolds was 738.94 Pa, whereas the hybrid scaffolds had a much lower total mean value of 177.88 Pa. The inclusion of KNN impacted the yield points, which may be due to the solid content of KNN in the hybrid scaffolds and/or the disruption caused by KNN to the crosslinking system. To ascertain the correlation between the frequency of testing and the storage (G\u2032) and loss (G\u2032\u2032) moduli of a material, a frequency sweep was conducted. Additionally, it provides valuable information on the viscoelastic characteristics and condition of a material by comparing the values of G\u2032 and G\u2032\u2032 across different frequencies. The G\u2032 and G\u2032\u2032 values of the examined scaffolds exhibited a high degree of frequency independence, with the loss modulus being consistently larger than the storage modulus over the almost entire range of frequencies (Fig. 11 C and D). Both types of scaffolds had G\u2032 and G\u2032\u2032 values that were independent of the frequency; however, MeHA alone scaffolds showed a crossover point, indicating reversible crosslinking. The mean and standard error of the total storage modulus (G\u2032) and yield point (tan \u03b4) of the frequency sweep of the tested scaffolds were presented in B and D. MeHA alone scaffolds had an average total storage modulus (G\u2032) of 46181.94 Pa, whereas the hybrid scaffolds had a much higher average total value of 142381.9 Pa. The incorporation of KNN into MeHA hydrogel shows promise for biological application, although it causes the partial pore formation and affects the yield point of the rheological properties, which paves the way for further investigations, such as biocompatibility, cell proliferation and differentiation, using different degrees of modifications and cross-linking agents, as well as various KNN particle sizes, wavelengths, and compositions.

Synthesis and characterization of photopolymerizable piezoelectric KNN-based methacrylated hyaluronic acid hydrogel scaffolds

# ABSTRACT
The use of methacrylated hyaluronic acid hydrogel (MeHA) has tremendous promise for regeneration purposes, while potassium sodium niobate (KNN) exhibits biocompatibility properties that make it suitable for biomedical applications. This study examined the synthesis and characterization of hybrid scaffolds composed of MeHA and KNN. The investigation focused on various aspects, including gelation time, micromorphology, topographic analysis, swelling behavior, changes in volume and degradation profiles, as well as mechanical properties, compared to MeHA alone scaffolds, along with the synthesis and characterization of KNN. The findings demonstrated that the incorporation of KNN into MeHA influenced some properties, including shorter gelation time and partial pore development. Nevertheless, a few notable differences between hybrid scaffolds and MeHA alone scaffolds were observed, while there were no substantial disparities overall. As a result, integrating KNN into MeHA has the potential to lead to further investigation, such as biological testing using different degrees of modification of MeHA, crosslinking systems, and KNN with variable sizes and piezoelectricity.

# INTRODUCTION
Over the past two decades, tissue engineering has been developed to address the lack of organ and tissue donors for patients with illnesses or injuries; a variety of materials can serve as scaffolds, which function as synthetic extracellular matrix (ECM) , to create synthetic alternatives that facilitate cell adhesion and provide a favorable milieu for cell proliferation, organization, and ultimately tissue regeneration. These scaffolds play a crucial role in organizing cells into a three-dimensional (3D) structure and facilitating the presentation of cues that guide the growth and development of a desired tissue; the achievement of effective tissue regeneration relies fundamentally on the intricate interaction between the scaffold, cells, and bioactive signals. The main goal of using scaffolds is to mimic the characteristics present in the ECM of different human tissues. Besides, the natural 3D environment within hydrogels has the ability to accurately reflect the ECM of different tissues, as well as the distribution of cell ligands and nutrients. Multiple studies have shown that the extensive use of HA, including MeHA, has significant promise for various applications, including cancer therapy, regeneration, face correction, spinal fusion, dental disease management, and hemostasis. Hyaluronic acid (HA), which is a naturally sourced glycosaminoglycan that possesses properties such as non-immunogenicity, non-adhesiveness, and bioactivity, offers a distinctive set of benefits for biomaterial formulations. HA has been associated with several cellular processes, such as angiogenesis and inflammatory regulation, and plays a vital role in regulating cell adherence, migration, and differentiation through various binding proteins and cell-surface receptors, such as CD44. Chemical alterations can be made to three specific functional groups (the carboxylic acid of glucuronic acid, the primary and secondary hydroxyl groups, and the N-acetyl group) on a HA chain using reactive molecules such as acrylates, methacrylates, and maleimides. The utilization of methacrylate HA (MeHA) hydrogels has demonstrated an increase in rigidity and heightened resistance to deterioration when compared to non-derivatized HA hydrogels. These MeHA hydrogels also maintain a desirable level of biocompatibility. As a result, there has been significant interest in both natural and synthetic variations of HA within the realm of tissue engineering scaffolds in recent years. Potassium sodium niobate (K,Na)0.5NbO3, commonly known as KNN, is a lead-free piezoelectric material that may be used as a replacement for lead-based ferroelectric materials. While still in the early stages of examination, KNN-based ceramics exhibit potential properties as biomaterials compared to other piezoelectric materials due to their positive impact on biological responses, such as improved adhesion and proliferation of osteoblast-like or mesenchymal stem cells. In a prior investigation, hydrogel and ultra-porous scaffold composites were synthesized by using different proportions of HA, KNN, and chitosan. While all composites were shown to be biocompatible, samples containing 90 % KNN exhibited elevated metabolic activity in osteoblast-like MG-63 cells even without external stimulation. The formulation containing 1.26 g of KNN, 0.14 g of HA, and 30 mL of chitosan showed the highest antibacterial activity against the fungal strain C. albicans and S. aureus among all the formulations tested in the same study. Hence, the studies have shown that both hydrogel and KNN possess the ability to be used for diverse applications in the field of biomedicine. However, the impact of incorporating KNN into MeHA hydrogel scaffolds on their synthesis and characterization is yet unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the synthesis and characterization, including gelation time, swelling, degradation, rheology, micromorphological, and topographical analyses of hybrid scaffolds consisting of MeHA hydrogel and KNN, in contrast to scaffolds made solely of MeHA hydrogel, together with the synthesis and characterization of KNN powder. The hypothesis was that integrating KNN into MeHA hydrogel scaffolds provides comparable structural and mechanical properties as opposed to scaffolds made of MeHA hydrogel alone without significant differences.

# CONCLUSION
Under the experimental condition, this study showed that there were some notable changes between hybrid scaffolds and MeHA alone scaffolds. The characterized KNN ceramics in this study have a sufficient d 33 for potential biological uses. The hybrid scaffolds exhibited a gelation time that was 30 % shorter compared to the MeHA alone scaffolds. After a week, the hybrid scaffolds exhibited a much higher swelling ratio, and after two weeks, MeHA alone scaffolds had an even greater swelling ratio. After 1 month, the degradation profile exhibited significantly reduced compressive strength and elastic modulus compared to the fresh samples. The hybrid scaffolds developed LVR in response to low shear stress conditions. Both types of scaffolds displayed G\u2032 and G\u2032\u2032 values independent of frequency, while MeHA alone scaffolds showed a crossover point, suggesting reversible crosslinking.
