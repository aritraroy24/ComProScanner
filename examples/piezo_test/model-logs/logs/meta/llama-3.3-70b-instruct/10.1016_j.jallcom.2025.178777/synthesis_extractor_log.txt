BCZT ceramics were prepared by the traditional solid-phase reaction method. According to the stoichiometric ratio, the raw materials of BaCO3 (99.90 %), CaCO3 (99.99 %), TiO2 (99.00 %) and ZrO2 (99.00 %) were accurately weighed. Then, the weighed powder and moderate ethanol were mixed and ball-milled for 12 hours. The mixture was placed into an oven and dried at 120 \xb0C. After the powder was completely dried, the powder was calcined at 1250 \xb0C for 5 h. The calcined powder was ball-milled again for 12 hours. The ball-milled powder was pressed into a desired size and shape by a cold isostatic press machine at 30 MPa for 15 minutes. Finally, the sample was kept at a sintering temperature of 1400\u20131500 \xb0C for 4 hours to obtain a dense ceramic plate. The ordinary ceramic plate was a cylinder, the radii of the upper and lower circles were both 4 mm, and the height of the cylinder was 0.6 mm. For the asymmetric-shaped ceramic plate, the radius of the lower circle was set to be 4 mm. The radius of the upper circle was determined by the designed angle, e.g., the radius of the upper circle was 1.5 mm with an angle being 12.5\xb0. Moreover, the height of the plate was 0.6 mm. The crystalline structures of BCZT ceramics were detected by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD, D/MAX 2500 V, Rigaku, Japan) with Cu K\u03b1 radiation and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM, Sigma 500, Zeiss, Germany). In order to characterize its electrical properties, the ceramic sample was sanded and polished to obtain a smooth surface with a thickness of about 0.6 mm. Then, the ceramic plate was coated with silver paste on both sides, and finally calcined at 600 \xb0C for 30 minutes to fix the silver paste on the surfaces of the ceramic plate. Before measuring electrical properties, the ceramic plate placed in silicone was polarized by a Direct-Current (DC) bias of 2\u20133 kV/mm for 30 min under room temperature. Polarization-Electric-field (P-E) hysteresis loops were obtained using a ferroelectric analyzer (TF analyzer 3000, AixACCT, Germany). A precision impedance analyzer (6500B, Wayne Kerr, China) was employed to measure the temperature-dependent dielectric constant of ceramics. The piezoelectric constant d 33 was measured by using a quasi-static d 33 meter (ZJ-6A, IACAS, China).

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
a shows the summarized XRD patterns of BCZT ceramics sintered at different temperatures from 1400 to 1500 \xb0C. According to the XRD patterns, all samples exhibit pure perovskite structures without any other heterogeneous peaks. It can be considered that CaE^{2+} has diffused to the A position of BaE^{2+}, ZrE^{4+} has diffused to the B position of TiE^{4+}, and CaE^{2+} and ZrE^{4+} have completely diffused into the BaTiO3 lattice to form a solid solution. The XRD patterns were profile-matched using Fullprof, refined using the Rietveld refinement method, and displayed in a\u2212e. The refined results show a good agreement between the measured XRD spectra and the fitted theoretical results. According to the lattice parameters obtained by refined results, the ceramics sintered from 1400 to 1500 \xb0C exhibit the coexistence of tetragonal (T) and orthorhombic (O) phases, which are very consistent with the P4mm and Amm2 models, respectively. The analyzed lattice parameters (i.e., a, b, c), refinement parameters (i.e., \uab53 E^{2}, R p, R wp , R exp ), and phase composition were summarized in. Then, the Debye-Scherrer formula was used to calculate the average size of particle size at different sintering temperatures, which could be expressed as follows , where k (k = 0.89) is the Scherrer constant, \u03b2 is the width at half maximum (FWHM) of the XRD peak, \u03b8 is the Bragg angle, \u03bb is the wavelength of X-ray (i.e, 1.5406 \xc5). For each sintering temperature, we have calculated the above parameters, i.e., 2\u03b8 (in degree), FWHM (in degree), \u03b2 (in rad), D (in nm), hkl, d hkl (in \xc5), and displayed in Tabs. S1-S5. Here, Bragg's law, i.e., 2 d hklsin\u03b8=n\u03bb, is employed to calculate d hkl with n being the diffraction order. The average particle sizes (D) calculated by the Debye-Scherrer formula are 28.24, 29.58, 29.85, 30.64, and 31.02 nm for the sintering temperatures of 1400, 1425, 1450, 1475 and 1500 \u2103, respectively. To further confirm the phase structures of BCZT ceramics sintered under different temperatures, Raman spectra were measured and shown in. It is worth noting that, BCZT has a basic matrix of BTO with the perovskite structure, so that the Raman modes are considered to be the same with that of the pure BTO. The Raman peaks of BTO with T phase are detected at approximately 250, 300, 520, and 720 cmE^{\u22121}, which correspond to the Raman modes of A1(TO2), E(TO2), A1(TO3) and A1(LO3)/E(LO3), respectively. The broadening and weakening of the Raman peaks at 150\u2013350 cmE^{\u22121} indicate the coexistence of the T and O phases. Therefore, the results of Raman spectroscopy also show the coexistence of T and O phases, which is consistent with the previous discussion of XRD results. Furthermore, we focus on the influence of sintering temperature on the microstructures of cylinder-shaped BCZT ceramics. The microstructures of BCZT ceramic plates sintered from 1400 to 1500 \xb0C were characterized by SEM and were shown in a to e, respectively. The SEM images indicate that the microstructures of BCZT ceramics would be significantly affected by the sintering temperatures. The microstructure of BCZT ceramic sintered at 1400 \xb0C is loose with the appearance of pores, and the grains are not uniform with a small average grain size of 16.52 \u03bcm, as shown in a. From b, we can observe that the grains of ceramic sintered at 1425 \xb0C are still not dense. However, the average grain size has increased to 17.81 \u03bcm. When the sintering temperature increased to 1450 \xb0C, the SEM image demonstrates that the grains are dense without obvious pores. More importantly, the distribution of grain size becomes more uniform and the average grain size increases to 22.30 \u03bcm. As the sintering temperature continually increased to 1475 \xb0C, the grain keeps rising with the appearance of some small voids, resulting in the abnormal growth of some grains. The average grain size has increased to 24.68 \u03bcm, as displayed in d. At 1500 \xb0C in f, the average grain size increases to 28.22 \u03bcm. Finally, the average grain sizes G a of BCZT ceramics sintered under various temperatures have been plotted in f. Based on the analyzation of microstructures of sintered ceramics, the optimal sintering temperature is considered as 1450 \xb0C to obtain the ceramic with dense and uniform grains. To demonstrate the performance of sintered ceramic plates, the ferroelectric properties of the plates were tested with a maximum electric field of 30 kV/cm at room temperature. While, the values of polarization at 30 kV/cm and the residual polarization are highly related to the sintering temperature. The maximum polarization values at 30 kV/cm are 21.14, 21.39, 22.02, 21.02, and 20.44 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} for the plates sintered at 1400, 1425, 1450, 1475, and 1500 \xb0C, respectively. Correspondingly, the residual polarizations are measured as 11.14, 10.67, 12.42, 10.95, and 8.87 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}. b shows the electroinduced strains under an electric field for the BCZT ceramic plates sintered under different temperatures. Based on the butterfly curves, the maximum values of plates sintered at 1400, 1425, 1450, 1475, and 1500 \xb0C could reach 0.117, 0.131, 0.141, 0.132, and 0.115 %, respectively. Therefore, the results indicate that the ceramic plate sintered at 1450 \xb0C exhibits the best ferroelectric and electrostriction properties, which have demonstrated the determination of microstructure on the ferroelectric property. According to previous characterizations of sintered ceramic powder and cylinder-shaped ceramic plates, the optimal sintering temperature would be 1450 \xb0C to obtain pure phase and high-quality sintered ceramic plates. Here, the plate with a cylinder shape and the plate with a specific frustum of a cone with an angle of 12.5\xb0 were selected as examples to indicate the effect of flexoelectricity on the piezoelectric performance. The cross-sectional SEM images of these two ceramic plates are shown in a and b. a shows the cross-sectional SEM image of an ordinary cylinder-shaped ceramic plate. The labeled angle exhibits 90\xb0. The cross-sectional SEM image of the plate with a specific frustum of a cone is shown in b and demonstrates the strong asymmetry of the plate. The angle labeled in b is about 12.5\xb0. After measuring the sizes, we could clearly observe that the radii of the lower and upper circles are 4 mm and 1.5 mm, respectively. Meanwhile, the height of the plate is measured as 0.6 mm. Then, the ferroelectric, electrostriction, and dielectric properties of BCZT ceramic plates sintered at 1450 \xb0C with different shapes were studied, as shown in a-c. Here, the cylinder-shaped plate is defined as 1450-C, while the frustum-of-a-cone-shaped plate is labeled as 1450-F. From a, the values of polarization values at 30 kV/cm for 1450-C and 1450-F are 22 and 20.74 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, respectively. The values of remanent polarization are 11.53 and 11.45 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, respectively. However, as shown in b, there is a significant difference between the butterfly curves of 1450-C and 1450-F. The maximum values of electroinduced strain under the electric field of 30 kV/cm are 0.141 % and 0.15 %, respectively, indicating a significant increase in the asymmetrical shape of the frustum of a cone. This result may be attributed to the asymmetric-shape-induced strain gradient. c shows the temperature-dependent relative dielectric constant and dielectric loss of 1450-C and 1450-F at a frequency of 1 kHz. As seen from the curves, a peak of dielectric constant is at around 40 \xb0C for both samples of 1450-C and 1450-F, which corresponds to the phase transition from the O phase to the T phase. Moreover, the Curie temperatures T c (i.e., from ferroelectric T phase to paraelectric phase) for the ceramic plates of both shapes are around 90 \xb0C. In order to have a comparison of piezoelectric performance of traditional cylinder-shaped plate (labeled as \u201cC\u201d in a and b) and frustum-of-a-cone-shaped plate (labeled as \u201cF\u201d in a and b), cylinder-shaped and frustum-of-a-cone-shaped ceramic plates sintered under various temperatures from 1400 to 1500 \xb0C were fabricated and measured. The converse piezoelectric coefficient d 33* (calculated by d 33*=S max /E max with S max being the maximum strain under the maximum electric field E max ) and piezoelectric coefficient d 33 were plotted in a and b, respectively. The d 33* of cylinder-shaped BCZT ceramics sintered at 1400, 1425, 1450, 1475, and 1500 \xb0C are 391.2, 437.7, 470.3, 437.8 and 387.7 pm/V, respectively. Meanwhile, the d 33 are 385.5, 417, 467.1, 435.8 and 373.3 pC/N, respectively. Importantly, for the plates sintered at 1400, 1425, 1450, 1475 and 1500 \xb0C with the shape of a frustum of a cone shape, the d 33* of plates are 414.6, 458.5, 501.4, 463.7, and 426.9 pm/V, respectively. The d 33 are 451.5, 460.8, 524.7, 479.8 and 434.9 pC/N, respectively. For the frustum-of-a-cone-shaped plate sintered at 1400 \xb0C, the performance of ceramic arrived at an excellent level of d 33* =501.4 pm/V and d 33= 524.7 pC/N. The increases of piezoelectric coefficient \u0394d 33 reach 66.0, 43.8, 57.6, 44.0, and 61.6 pC/N between the frustum-of-a-cone-shaped plate and the cylinder-shaped plate sintered from 1400 \xb0C to 1500 \xb0C, respectively. Meanwhile, the corresponding increase rates are 17.1 %, 10.5 %, 12.3 %, 10.1 %, and 16.5 %, respectively. To analyze the determination of shape on piezoelectric response, the finite element simulations were performed by using COMSOL Multiphysics 6.2 to obtain the strain distribution in plates under mechanical loads. Similar to the configurations in the piezoelectric coefficient measurement using a quasi-static d 33 meter, spherical indenters were employed to apply the mechanical loads at the upper and lower surfaces. Finally, we also revealed the performance of ceramic plates with various shapes of frustum of a cone by changing the angle from 12.5\xb0 to 90\xb0 (i.e., cylinder-shaped). Then, the electrostrictive butterfly curves and piezoelectric coefficient d 33 were measured for the plates with different shapes (i.e., the angle from 12.5\xb0 to 90\xb0), as depicted in. Here, all measured ceramics were sintered at 1450 \xb0C. the electrostrictive butterfly curves indicate that the electroinduced strains are symmetrical for the cylinder-shaped plates under the 30 kV/cm and \u221230 kV/cm. While the electroinduced strains exhibit a strong asymmetry for the plates with other shapes under the 30 kV/cm and \u221230 kV/cm. Under the applied electric field of \u221230 kV/cm, the electroinduced strain decreases with the rising of the angle. According to the results, the plate with 12.5\xb0 exhibits the best performance in electroinduced strain and piezoelectric response. The piezoelectric coefficient of the plate with 12.5\xb0 is as high as 520.1 \xb1 3.30 pC/N. With the increase of the angle, the piezoelectric coefficient is gradually decreasing to 462.2 \xb1 3.61 pC/N. From the SEM images, we could clearly obvious that the grains are dense and with uniform grain sizes, indicating the high-quality of as-prepared plates. The ceramic densities are 5.376, 5.395, 5.434, 5.285, and 5.333 g/cmE^{3} for the plates with the angles of 12.5\xb0, 25\xb0, 50\xb0, 75\xb0, and 90\xb0, respectively. In addition, the BCZT ceramics studied in this work were prepared by the traditional solid-phase reaction method. On the other hand, if the sol-gel method is employed to synthesize the BCZT ceramic powders, the results may have significant differences. The quality of the ceramic plate should be improved, which benefits to further improve the piezoelectric performance of BCZT ceramic.

The ordinary ceramic plate was a cylinder, the radii of the upper and lower circles were both 4 mm, and the height of the cylinder was 0.6 mm. For the asymmetric-shaped ceramic plate, the radius of the lower circle was set to be 4 mm.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
a shows the summarized XRD patterns of BCZT ceramics sintered at different temperatures from 1400 to 1500 \xb0C. According to the XRD patterns, all samples exhibit pure perovskite structures without any other heterogeneous peaks. It can be considered that CaE^{2+} has diffused to the A position of BaE^{2+}, ZrE^{4+} has diffused to the B position of TiE^{4+}, and CaE^{2+} and ZrE^{4+} have completely diffused into the BaTiO3 lattice to form a solid solution. The XRD patterns were profile-matched using Fullprof, refined using the Rietveld refinement method, and displayed in a\u2212e. The refined results show a good agreement between the measured XRD spectra and the fitted theoretical results.

The analyzed lattice parameters (i.e., a, b, c), refinement parameters (i.e., \uab53 E^{2}, R p, R wp , R exp ), and phase composition were summarized in. Then, the Debye-Scherrer formula was used to calculate the average size of particle size at different sintering temperatures, which could be expressed as follows , where k (k = 0.89) is the Scherrer constant, \u03b2 is the width at half maximum (FWHM) of the XRD peak, \u03b8 is the Bragg angle, \u03bb is the wavelength of X-ray (i.e, 1.5406 \xc5). For each sintering temperature, we have calculated the above parameters, i.e., 2\u03b8 (in degree), FWHM (in degree), \u03b2 (in rad), D (in nm), hkl, d hkl (in \xc5), and displayed in Tabs. S1-S5. Here, Bragg's law, i.e., 2 d hklsin\u03b8=n\u03bb, is employed to calculate d hkl with n being the diffraction order. The average particle sizes (D) calculated by the Debye-Scherrer formula are 28.24, 29.58, 29.85, 30.64, and 31.02 nm for the sintering temperatures of 1400, 1425, 1450, 1475 and 1500 \u2103, respectively. To further confirm the phase structures of BCZT ceramics sintered under different temperatures, Raman spectra were measured and shown in. It is worth noting that, BCZT has a basic matrix of BTO with the perovskite structure, so that the Raman modes are considered to be the same with that of the pure BTO. The Raman peaks of BTO with T phase are detected at approximately 250, 300, 520, and 720 cmE^{\u22121}, which correspond to the Raman modes of A1(TO2), E(TO2), A1(TO3) and A1(LO3)/E(LO3), respectively. The broadening and weakening of the Raman peaks at 150\u2013350 cmE^{\u22121} indicate the coexistence of the T and O phases. Therefore, the results of Raman spectroscopy also show the coexistence of T and O phases, which is consistent with the previous discussion of XRD results. Furthermore, we focus on the influence of sintering temperature on the microstructures of cylinder-shaped BCZT ceramics. The microstructures of BCZT ceramic plates sintered from 1400 to 1500 \xb0C were characterized by SEM and were shown in a to e, respectively. The SEM images indicate that the microstructures of BCZT ceramics would be significantly affected by the sintering temperatures. The microstructure of BCZT ceramic sintered at 1400 \xb0C is loose with the appearance of pores, and the grains are not uniform with a small average grain size of 16.52 \u03bcm, as shown in a. From b, we can observe that the grains of ceramic sintered at 1425 \xb0C are still not dense. However, the average grain size has increased to 17.81 \u03bcm. When the sintering temperature increased to 1450 \xb0C, the SEM image demonstrates that the grains are dense without obvious pores. More importantly, the distribution of grain size becomes more uniform and the average grain size increases to 22.30 \u03bcm. As the sintering temperature continually increased to 1475 \xb0C, the grain keeps rising with the appearance of some small voids, resulting in the abnormal growth of some grains. The average grain size has increased to 24.68 \u03bcm, as displayed in d. At 1500 \xb0C in f, the average grain size increases to 28.22 \u03bcm. Finally, the average grain sizes G a of BCZT ceramics sintered under various temperatures have been plotted in f. Based on the analyzation of microstructures of sintered ceramics, the optimal sintering temperature is considered as 1450 \xb0C to obtain the ceramic with dense and uniform grains. To demonstrate the performance of sintered ceramic plates, the ferroelectric properties of the plates were tested with a maximum electric field of 30 kV/cm at room temperature. While, the values of polarization at 30 kV/cm and the residual polarization are highly related to the sintering temperature. The maximum polarization values at 30 kV/cm are 21.14, 21.39, 22.02, 21.02, and 20.44 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} for the plates sintered at 1400, 1425, 1450, 1475, and 1500 \xb0C, respectively. Correspondingly, the residual polarizations are measured as 11.14, 10.67, 12.42, 10.95, and 8.87 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}. b shows the electroinduced strains under an electric field for the BCZT ceramic plates sintered under different temperatures. Based on the butterfly curves, the maximum values of plates sintered at 1400, 1425, 1450, 1475, and 1500 \xb0C could reach 0.117, 0.131, 0.141, 0.132, and 0.115 %, respectively. Therefore, the results indicate that the ceramic plate sintered at 1450 \xb0C exhibits the best ferroelectric and electrostriction properties, which have demonstrated the determination of microstructure on the ferroelectric property. According to previous characterizations of sintered ceramic powder and cylinder-shaped ceramic plates, the optimal sintering temperature would be 1450 \xb0C to obtain pure phase and high-quality sintered ceramic plates. Here, the plate with a cylinder shape and the plate with a specific frustum of a cone with an angle of 12.5\xb0 were selected as examples to indicate the effect of flexoelectricity on the piezoelectric performance. The cross-sectional SEM images of these two ceramic plates are shown in a and b. a shows the cross-sectional SEM image of an ordinary cylinder-shaped ceramic plate. The labeled angle exhibits 90\xb0. The cross-sectional SEM image of the plate with a specific frustum of a cone is shown in b and demonstrates the strong asymmetry of the plate. The angle labeled in b is about 12.5\xb0. After measuring the sizes, we could clearly observe that the radii of the lower and upper circles are 4 mm and 1.5 mm, respectively. Meanwhile, the height of the plate is measured as 0.6 mm. Then, the ferroelectric, electrostriction, and dielectric properties of BCZT ceramic plates sintered at 1450 \xb0C with different shapes were studied, as shown in a-c. Here, the cylinder-shaped plate is defined as 1450-C, while the frustum-of-a-cone-shaped plate is labeled as 1450-F. From a, the values of polarization values at 30 kV/cm for 1450-C and 1450-F are 22 and 20.74 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, respectively. The values of remanent polarization are 11.53 and 11.45 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, respectively. However, as shown in b, there is a significant difference between the butterfly curves of 1450-C and 1450-F. The maximum values of electroinduced strain under the electric field of 30 kV/cm are 0.141 % and 0.15 %, respectively, indicating a significant increase in the asymmetrical shape of the frustum of a cone. This result may be attributed to the asymmetric-shape-induced strain gradient. c shows the temperature-dependent relative dielectric constant and dielectric loss of 1450-C and 1450-F at a frequency of 1 kHz. As seen from the curves, a peak of dielectric constant is at around 40 \xb0C for both samples of 1450-C and 1450-F, which corresponds to the phase transition from the O phase to the T phase. Moreover, the Curie temperatures T c (i.e., from ferroelectric T phase to paraelectric phase) for the ceramic plates of both shapes are around 90 \xb0C. In order to have a comparison of piezoelectric performance of traditional cylinder-shaped plate (labeled as \u201cC\u201d in a and b) and frustum-of-a-cone-shaped plate (labeled as \u201cF\u201d in a and b), cylinder-shaped and frustum-of-a-cone-shaped ceramic plates sintered under various temperatures from 1400 to 1500 \xb0C were fabricated and measured. The converse piezoelectric coefficient d 33* (calculated by d 33*=S max /E max with S max being the maximum strain under the maximum electric field E max ) and piezoelectric coefficient d 33 were plotted in a and b, respectively. The d 33* of cylinder-shaped BCZT ceramics sintered at 1400, 1425, 1450, 1475, and 1500 \xb0C are 391.2, 437.7, 470.3, 437.8 and 387.7 pm/V, respectively. Meanwhile, the d 33 are 385.5, 417, 467.1, 435.8 and 373.3 pC/N, respectively. Importantly, for the plates sintered at 1400, 1425, 1450, 1475 and 1500 \xb0C with the shape of a frustum of a cone shape, the d 33* of plates are 414.6, 458.5, 501.4, 463.7, and 426.9 pm/V, respectively. The d 33 are 451.5, 460.8, 524.7, 479.8 and 434.9 pC/N, respectively. For the frustum-of-a-cone-shaped plate sintered at 1400 \xb0C, the performance of ceramic arrived at an excellent level of d 33* =501.4 pm/V and d 33= 524.7 pC/N. The increases of piezoelectric coefficient \u0394d 33 reach 66.0, 43.8, 57.6, 44.0, and 61.6 pC/N between the frustum-of-a-cone-shaped plate and the cylinder-shaped plate sintered from 1400 \xb0C to 1500 \xb0C, respectively. Meanwhile, the corresponding increase rates are 17.1 %, 10.5 %, 12.3 %, 10.1 %, and 16.5 %, respectively. To analyze the determination of shape on piezoelectric response, the finite element simulations were performed by using COMSOL Multiphysics 6.2 to obtain the strain distribution in plates under mechanical loads. Similar to the configurations in the piezoelectric coefficient measurement using a quasi-static d 33 meter, spherical indenters were employed to apply the mechanical loads at the upper and lower surfaces. Finally, we also revealed the performance of ceramic plates with various shapes of frustum of a cone by changing the angle from 12.5\xb0 to 90\xb0 (i.e., cylinder-shaped). Then, the electrostrictive butterfly curves and piezoelectric coefficient d 33 were measured for the plates with different shapes (i.e., the angle from 12.5\xb0 to 90\xb0), as depicted in. Here, all measured ceramics were sintered at 1450 \xb0C. the electrostrictive butterfly curves indicate that the electroinduced strains are symmetrical for the cylinder-shaped plates under the 30 kV/cm and \u221230 kV/cm. While the electroinduced strains exhibit a strong asymmetry for the plates with other shapes under the 30 kV/cm and \u221230 kV/cm. Under the applied electric field of \u221230 kV/cm, the electroinduced strain decreases with the rising of the angle. According to the results, the plate with 12.5\xb0 exhibits the best performance in electroinduced strain and piezoelectric response. The piezoelectric coefficient of the plate with 12.5\xb0 is as high as 520.1 \xb1 3.30 pC/N. With the increase of the angle, the piezoelectric coefficient is gradually decreasing to 462.2 \xb1 3.61 pC/N. From the SEM images, we could clearly obvious that the grains are dense and with uniform grain sizes, indicating the high-quality of as-prepared plates. The ceramic densities are 5.376, 5.395, 5.434, 5.285, and 5.333 g/cmE^{3} for the plates with the angles of 12.5\xb0, 25\xb0, 50\xb0, 75\xb0, and 90\xb0, respectively. In addition, the BCZT ceramics studied in this work were prepared by the traditional solid-phase reaction method. On the other hand, if the sol-gel method is employed to synthesize the BCZT ceramic powders, the results may have significant differences. The quality of the ceramic plate should be improved, which benefits to further improve the piezoelectric performance of BCZT ceramic.
