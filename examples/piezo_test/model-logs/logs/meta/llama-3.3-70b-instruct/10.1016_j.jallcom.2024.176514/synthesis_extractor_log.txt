The BNT-based thin films were prepared using the chemical solution deposition (CSD) method. Sodium acetate, strontium acetate, bismuth acetate, and barium acetate were weighed in turn according to the stoichiometric ratio by an analytical balance and added to the solvents. 12 mol% excess sodium acetate and 2 mol% excess bismuth acetate were used to compensate for the possible evaporation of sodium and bismuth during high-temperature annealing. The precursor solution of BNT-ST-100xBT solution was obtained after stirring the mixture at 80\xb0C for one hour. A solution concentration of 0.4 mol/L was achieved by adjusting the solvent content. BNT-ST-100xBT solution was deposited on pretreated Pt/TiO2/SiO2/Si substrates by a spin coating method. The solution was dropped onto the substrate, followed by rotating the substrate at 1500 r/min for 10 s and then 3000 r/min for 40 s to make the precursor solution cover the substrate surface uniformly and completely. The deposited film was placed in a rapid thermal treatment (RTP) furnace for heat treatment. Two pyrolysis processes were taken out, at 150\xb0C for 3 min to evaporate the solvent and then at 410\xb0C for 10 min to remove organic components. The annealing process was taken out at 725\xb0C for 3 min for crystallization. The deposition and heating procedures were repeated 6 times to prepare BNT-ST-100xBT thin films with the designed thickness. Au electrodes with a diameter of 0.3 mm were prepared onto the surface of thin films by DC sputtering. Using a high-resolution X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Empyrean, Panalytical) with Cu K\u03b11 radiation (\u03bb = 1.5406 \xc5), the measurement of the crystal structure of BNT-ST-100xBT films was completed. The surface morphology and cross-sectional morphology of the films were observed by scanning electron microscope (FESEM, 250 FEG, FEI Quanta). The surface topography, piezoresponse amplitude, and phase images were characterized using scanning probe microscopy (SPM, Dimension Icon, Bruker). The dielectric properties as a function of frequency, DC voltage, and temperature of the thin films were collected by using a precision impedance analyzer (E4980a, Agilent Technologies Inc). The polarization-electric field ferroelectric hysteresis loops at room temperature were measured using a ferroelectric analyzer (TF analyzer 2000, aixACCT). The bipolar strain curves and unipolar strain curves of the films were measured at room temperature using a ferroelectric analyzer equipped with a double-beam laser interferometer (aixDBLI, aixACCT).

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
shows the XRD 2\u03b8 patterns ranging from 20\xb0 to 65\xb0 of BNT-ST-100xBT lead-free piezoelectric thin films. It can be seen in (a) that four peaks appear at 2\u03b8 = 22.8\xb0, 32.5\xb0, 46.6\xb0, and 57.9\xb0, corresponding to the (001), (110), (002), and (112) reflections of the BNT-ST-100xBT films respectively. The diffraction peak of Pt (111) was detected at 39.9\xb0. There no second-phase peaks were detected by XRD, indicating that BT had completely dissolved in the BNT-20ST crystal matrix, forming a uniform and stable solid solution with a single perovskite structure. The XRD patterns confirm the polycrystalline structure in all thin films without any preferred orientation. Analysis of the (111) and (002) peaks is a useful method to distinguish the tetragonal and rhombohedral phases in BNT-based materials. In order to better understand the symmetry structure of BNT-ST-100xBT, the XRD slow scan results of the thin films at 2\u03b8 = 45.7\xb0 - 47.4\xb0 were plotted in (b). Prado et al. , the amplified (002) peaks of all the thin films were fitted well using a single peak without obvious splitting characteristics, indicating that the thin films have a pseudocubic structure. It was reported that a pseudocubic structure existed in BNT-ST-BT ceramics with low BT content, while when the BT content increased by more than 8 %, a tetragonal structure arose. However, in our BNT-ST-BT thin film with BT ranging from 2 % to 11 %, pseudocubic dominant. It is commonly observed in BNT-based thin films as an approach-cubic structure due to the tiny lattice distortion of BNT-based material and small grains of thin films. In addition, with the increase of BT content, the BaE^{2+}(r=1.35 \xc5) enters the BNT-ST lattice and replaces the original NaE^{+} (r = 0.95 \xc5), BiE^{3+} (r = 1.08 \xc5) and SrE^{2+} (r = 1.13 \xc5) at A site. The larger ionic radius of BaE^{2+} expands the crystal lattice of the film, causing the XRD peaks to shift to lower 2\u03b8 values. The surface morphologies of BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.11) thin films were shown in (a-e), and the related corresponding grain size count were exhibited in (f). The particles of all films were uniform, with a statistical distribution size below 70 nm, and varied little in the film composition. (g-k) shows the cross-sectional morphologies of BNT-ST-100xBT films with Pt/TiO2/SiO2/Si structure. The thickness of thin films was determined from the images in the range of 0.69\u20130.76 \u03bcm. One is the Scherrer equation based on XRD patterns , and another is dimensioning from the SEM images. Except for a discrepancy in BNT-ST-11BT thin film, the mean grain sizes were around 40 nm for the films. depicts the dielectric constant and loss versus temperature for the BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.11) thin films from 25\xb0C to 200\xb0C at various frequencies of 1 kHz, 10 kHz and 100 kHz. As shown in (a)-(e), the dielectric constants of all films exhibited similar behavior as a function of the temperature, i.e., firstly increased and then decreased, while at the same temperature, the dielectric constant (\u03b5r) decreased when increasing the frequency. At room temperature, BNT-ST-6BT thin films represented the largest value among all films at each frequency, demonstrating their good polarization property. All films showed rather low dielectric loss (<0.04), which is related to the high quality and dense structure of the film prepared in this work. One dielectric anomaly appeared at the temperature of T m, at which the maximum permittivity (\u03b5m) was observed in all the thin films. In the thin films with x = 0.02\u20130.08, as the BT content increased, the dielectric peak moved toward lower temperatures. To further explore the relaxation properties of the films, the relaxation degree was calculated through the modified Curie-Weiss law : Where \u03b5 r is the relative dielectric permittivity at the temperature T (T > T m ), and C is the Curie-like constant. The coefficient \u03b3 reflects the ferroelectricity degree or relaxation degree of the material, for which close to 1 means ideal normal ferroelectricity, and close to 2 indicates that the material has classic relaxation properties. The BNT-ST-2BT thin film with a lower \u03b3 value is due to the coexistence of ferroelectric and relaxor state, while the thin films with BT content of more than 4 % with \u03b3 value close to 2 demonstrate an approach-ergodic relaxor characteristic. (a-j) exhibits the curves of the dielectric constant and dielectric loss of the BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.11) thin films as a function of DC electric field from \u2212300 kV\xb7cmE^{\u22121} to 300 kV\xb7cmE^{\u22121} (\u03b5 r-E curves) at room temperature. The \u03b5 r-E curves of BNT-ST-2BT thin film presented a "butterfly" shape with obvious hysteresis, while, when the BT content increased, a \u201cdouble butterfly\u201d shape appeared, and the feature became more apparent. The dielectric loss vs. electric field curves exhibited a \u201cdouble butterfly\u201d shape in all films, and the feature became more apparent with BT content increasing. The dielectric constant and loss curves of BNT-ST-2BT thin films in (a) and (f) show two broadened \u03b5 peaks and four loss peaks. The characteristics are similar to those reported in BNT-based materials around depoling temperature , where nonergodic and ergodic relaxation states coexist. For BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.04\u20130.11) thin films in (b-e) and (g-j), four peaks in the dielectric constant and loss curves appeared due to the branches on the decreasing field, which is the feature of BNT-based materials at a temperature higher than depoling temperature with ergodic relaxor state. The ferroelectric properties of BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.11) thin films were characterized, and the P-E loos, maximum polarization (P max), remanent polarization (P r), P max-P r and coercive field (E c) values at a maximum applied electric field (E max) of 600 kV/cm were displayed in (a, b). With the increase of BT content, the ordered ferroelectric domain was destroyed, while the P max and P r showed a decreasing trend. The BNT-ST-2BT thin film exhibited the strongest ferroelectricity, with the P max and P r larger than the other four films, indicating that more ferroelectric domains along the polarization field are maintained after the electric field is removed in the film. The minimum \u03b3 in  for BNT-ST-2BT thin film conforms with the strongest ferroelectricity related to domain motion. The thin films with x = 0.04 \u223c 0.11 exhibited low-hysteresis P-E loops with a slim shape, low P r, and high E c, related to the relaxor ferroelectric feature with ergodic polar nanoregions (PNRs). The redirect of the PNRs when an electric field is applied contributes to the generation of polarization. The weakly correlated ergodic PNRs return to the disordered state upon the removal of the applied field, thus giving rise to the near-zero remanent polarization. The P max and P r of other components (x = 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, and 0.11) were not much different, but relatively large P max and P r can still be observed at x = 0.06, which is closely related to the maximum dielectric constant shown in (c). Moreover, the composition x = 0.06 exhibited a low E c , demonstrating the dominative of ergodic relaxor phase, which is in favor of hysteresis-free electrostrain. (c-g) describes the polarization loops of BNT-ST-100xBT thin films under different E max. Bipolar strain curves were obtained by applying 600 kV/cm for the BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.11) thin films. The fitting of the strain curve at x = 0.11 with a parabolic function was shown in (a) as an example. Based on the data of the S-E loops in (a) and the corresponding P-E loops at an E max of 600 kV/cm in (a), the S-P E^{2} curves were calculated and shown in (b). The strain to the square of the polarization for the film at x = 0.02 deviated slightly from linearity, which is related to its strongest ferroelectricity. Films of other components (x = 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, and 0.11) all showed a highly linear relationship of S-P E^{2} curves, indicating pure electrostrictive behavior with short-range ordered polarization. The electrostrictive coefficients Q were calculated from the S-P E^{2} curves according to formula (1) and shown in. BNT-ST-6BT thin films have achieved the largest electrostrictive coefficient, 0.21 mE^{4}/CE^{2}, which is an order of magnitude higher than that obtained in ceramics. The unipolar strain of BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.11) thin films at an E max of 600 kV/cm and 1800 kV/cm were shown in (c). The unipolar strain curves measured at 600 kV/cm exhibited a parabolic shape behavior, which is similar to that of bipolar strain curves. With the increase of the applied electric field from 600 kV/cm to 1800 kV/cm, the strains increased linearly, which is an advantage for actuating applications. Furthermore, the hysteresis of the unipolar strain curve was small, which indicates a good application potential of BNT-ST-100xBT thin films. By linearly fitting the strain curve under the electric field from 600 kV/cm to 1800 kV/cm in (c), the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 of each component can be obtained, as shown in. The largest d 33 value was obtained in x = 0.02 film. Beyond that, the x = 0.06 films exhibited the biggest d 33 value in the besides components. Furthermore, by changing the E max, a series of unipolar S-E curves of BNT-ST-6BT thin films were acquired and presented in (d). The S-E curves below 600 kV/cm appeared parabolic in shape, while, as the applied electric field increased to 2400 kV/cm, the strain increased linearly until a remarkable strain value of 0.82 % was achieved. To understand the domain and polarization behavior in these relaxor thin films, the BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.02, 0.06, 0.11) films were studied by PFM. Clear grain boundaries can be observed in the topography images, with the grain size being tens of nanometers, which is in agreement with that calculated from SEM images. The phase images of the three films in (d-f) emerged as a \u201cmosaic-like\u201d form, meaning no domain feature can be determined from the phase images. The blue circled region in (h) of BNT-ST-2BT thin films appeared to have a distinct amplitude response in nm-sized, which would be likely related to nanodomains. The remaining region without amplitude signal may be related to PNRs, which are below the resolution of PFM measurements (tens of nanometers, depending on the tip and measurement parameters), appearing as noise form. No mesoscopic domain feature can be observed for BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.06, 0.11) films in (i, j), which could be in PNRs form. The domain characterization of these films was in the size of tens of nanometers or in PNRs, which was related to their relaxor behavior increasing with BT content. The BNT-ST-BT thin films in this work exhibit outstanding electrostrictive coefficients. Furthermore, the BNT-ST-6BT thin films can take both sides of high giant electrostrictive coefficients and excellent electrostrain properties. The binary BNT-ST solid solution is regarded as a potential base for high strain performance, with composition located on the ferroelectric and relaxor phase boundary with an ST content of 20\u223c25 %. By introducing BT into the binary solid solution to form ternary materials, the polarization decreased with increasing BT content. When the BT content increased higher than 2 %, the P-E loops became slim, and diffusion coefficient \u03b3 was close to 2, which are characteristics of a relaxor material. In this work, as expected, except for the BNT-ST-2BT thin film, the compositions, including x from 0.04 to 0.11, exhibited a predominant relaxor behavior with \u03b3 approaching 2. The polarization distribution of these ergodic relaxor thin films is in the form of nanodomains/PNRs, as shown in (b). As a result, giant Q values were obtained in the BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.11) thin films, largely higher than the results reported. Compared to the above composition, the lower electrostrictive coefficient in x = 0.02 is due to its lower relaxor degree, which, in turn, is beneficial to the highest piezoelectric coefficient in this film. The low dielectric constant, lower than 200 at 1 kHz in the BNT-ST-BT thin films, is beneficial in reaching a large electrostrictive coefficient. In addition, the largest Q was obtained in BNT-ST-6BT thin films, higher than the other components in the deep ergodic relaxation zone. It was reported in BNT-based materials that the BT content played an effective role in regular polarization and piezoelectric properties. The phase boundary of a ferroelectric/relaxor or nonergodic/ergodic relaxor can be constructed by varying the BT content. The phase diagram of BNT-ST-100xBT ceramics has reported that the pseudocubic and tetragonal phases coexist in the x range of 0.04\u20130.06, in which the composition of a large electrostrain can be obtained by constructing ferroelectrics with ergodic relaxation characteristics. In our BNT-ST-100xBT thin films, a single pseudocubic phase was observed in the films with BT content ranging from 2 % to 11 %. The absence of obvious phase transition in these films from XRD analysis is likely due to the small lattice distortion in this system, a phenomenon which was reported in the BNT-BT-NN ternary solid solutions. An evident performance variation with BT content were pronounced that, which is in BNT-ST-6BT thin films, the largest dielectric constant, the largest polarization variability, the highest piezoelectric coefficient, and the largest strain response were obtained. It is believed the BaE^{2+} diffused into the BNT-ST lattice, increasing the A-site disorder and resulting in a phase disorder transition in microscale at the BNT-ST-6BT compositions. The largest Q obtained in BNT-ST-6BT thin films is due to the largest strain response and low polarization according to formula (1).

The BNT-ST-2BT thin film exhibited the strongest ferroelectricity, with the P max and P r larger than the other four films, indicating that more ferroelectric domains along the polarization field are maintained after the electric field is removed in the film. The minimum \u03b3 in  for BNT-ST-2BT thin film conforms with the strongest ferroelectricity related to domain motion. The thin films with x = 0.04 \u223c 0.11 exhibited low-hysteresis P-E loops with a slim shape, low P r, and high E c, related to the relaxor ferroelectric feature with ergodic polar nanoregions (PNRs). The redirect of the PNRs when an electric field is applied contributes to the generation of polarization. The weakly correlated ergodic PNRs return to the disordered state upon the removal of the applied field, thus giving rise to the near-zero remanent polarization. The P max and P r of other components (x = 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, and 0.11) were not much different, but relatively large P max and P r can still be observed at x = 0.06, which is closely related to the maximum dielectric constant shown in (c). Moreover, the composition x = 0.06 exhibited a low E c , demonstrating the dominative of ergodic relaxor phase, which is in favor of hysteresis-free electrostrain. (c-g) describes the polarization loops of BNT-ST-100xBT thin films under different E max. Bipolar strain curves were obtained by applying 600 kV/cm for the BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.11) thin films. The fitting of the strain curve at x = 0.11 with a parabolic function was shown in (a) as an example. Based on the data of the S-E loops in (a) and the corresponding P-E loops at an E max of 600 kV/cm in (a), the S-P E^{2} curves were calculated and shown in (b). The strain to the square of the polarization for the film at x = 0.02 deviated slightly from linearity, which is related to its strongest ferroelectricity. Films of other components (x = 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, and 0.11) all showed a highly linear relationship of S-P E^{2} curves, indicating pure electrostrictive behavior with short-range ordered polarization. The electrostrictive coefficients Q were calculated from the S-P E^{2} curves according to formula (1) and shown in. BNT-ST-6BT thin films have achieved the largest electrostrictive coefficient, 0.21 mE^{4}/CE^{2}, which is an order of magnitude higher than that obtained in ceramics. The unipolar strain of BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.11) thin films at an E max of 600 kV/cm and 1800 kV/cm were shown in (c). The unipolar strain curves measured at 600 kV/cm exhibited a parabolic shape behavior, which is similar to that of bipolar strain curves. With the increase of the applied electric field from 600 kV/cm to 1800 kV/cm, the strains increased linearly, which is an advantage for actuating applications. Furthermore, the hysteresis of the unipolar strain curve was small, which indicates a good application potential of BNT-ST-100xBT thin films. By linearly fitting the strain curve under the electric field from 600 kV/cm to 1800 kV/cm in (c), the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 of each component can be obtained, as shown in. The largest d 33 value was obtained in x = 0.02 film. Beyond that, the x = 0.06 films exhibited the biggest d 33 value in the besides components. Furthermore, by changing the E max, a series of unipolar S-E curves of BNT-ST-6BT thin films were acquired and presented in (d). The S-E curves below 600 kV/cm appeared parabolic in shape, while, as the applied electric field increased to 2400 kV/cm, the strain increased linearly until a remarkable strain value of 0.82 % was achieved. To understand the domain and polarization behavior in these relaxor thin films, the BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.02, 0.06, 0.11) films were studied by PFM. Clear grain boundaries can be observed in the topography images, with the grain size being tens of nanometers, which is in agreement with that calculated from SEM images. The phase images of the three films in (d-f) emerged as a \u201cmosaic-like\u201d form, meaning no domain feature can be determined from the phase images. The blue circled region in (h) of BNT-ST-2BT thin films appeared to have a distinct amplitude response in nm-sized, which would be likely related to nanodomains. The remaining region without amplitude signal may be related to PNRs, which are below the resolution of PFM measurements (tens of nanometers, depending on the tip and measurement parameters), appearing as noise form. No mesoscopic domain feature can be observed for BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.06, 0.11) films in (i, j), which could be in PNRs form. The domain characterization of these films was in the size of tens of nanometers or in PNRs, which was related to their relaxor behavior increasing with BT content. The BNT-ST-BT thin films in this work exhibit outstanding electrostrictive coefficients. Furthermore, the BNT-ST-6BT thin films can take both sides of high giant electrostrictive coefficients and excellent electrostrain properties. The binary BNT-ST solid solution is regarded as a potential base for high strain performance, with composition located on the ferroelectric and relaxor phase boundary with an ST content of 20\u223c25 %. By introducing BT into the binary solid solution to form ternary materials, the polarization decreased with increasing BT content. When the BT content increased higher than 2 %, the P-E loops became slim, and diffusion coefficient \u03b3 was close to 2, which are characteristics of a relaxor material. In this work, as expected, except for the BNT-ST-2BT thin film, the compositions, including x from 0.04 to 0.11, exhibited a predominant relaxor behavior with \u03b3 approaching 2. The polarization distribution of these ergodic relaxor thin films is in the form of nanodomains/PNRs, as shown in (b). As a result, giant Q values were obtained in the BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.11) thin films, largely higher than the results reported. Compared to the above composition, the lower electrostrictive coefficient in x = 0.02 is due to its lower relaxor degree, which, in turn, is beneficial to the highest piezoelectric coefficient in this film. The low dielectric constant, lower than 200 at 1 kHz in the BNT-ST-BT thin films, is beneficial in reaching a large electrostrictive coefficient. In addition, the largest Q was obtained in BNT-ST-6BT thin films, higher than the other components in the deep ergodic relaxation zone. It was reported in BNT-based materials that the BT content played an effective role in regular polarization and piezoelectric properties. The phase boundary of a ferroelectric/relaxor or nonergodic/ergodic relaxor can be constructed by varying the BT content. The phase diagram of BNT-ST-100xBT ceramics has reported that the pseudocubic and tetragonal phases coexist in the x range of 0.04\u20130.06, in which the composition of a large electrostrain can be obtained by constructing ferroelectrics with ergodic relaxation characteristics. In our BNT-ST-100xBT thin films, a single pseudocubic phase was observed in the films with BT content ranging from 2 % to 11 %. The absence of obvious phase transition in these films from XRD analysis is likely due to the small lattice distortion in this system, a phenomenon which was reported in the BNT-BT-NN ternary solid solutions. An evident performance variation with BT content were pronounced that, which is in BNT-ST-6BT thin films, the largest dielectric constant, the largest polarization variability, the highest piezoelectric coefficient, and the largest strain response were obtained. It is believed the BaE^{2+} diffused into the BNT-ST lattice, increasing the A-site disorder and resulting in a phase disorder transition in microscale at the BNT-ST-6BT compositions. The largest Q obtained in BNT-ST-6BT thin films is due to the largest strain response and low polarization according to formula (1).
