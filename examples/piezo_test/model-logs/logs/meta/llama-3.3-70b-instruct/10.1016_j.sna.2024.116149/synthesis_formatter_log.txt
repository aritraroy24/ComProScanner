Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'slicing and poling', 'precursors': ['Pb(In1/2Nb1/2)O3-Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3', 'Pb(Zr0.5Ti0.5)O3'], 'steps': ['The PIMNT samples were sliced into 5xd75xd70.5 mmE^{3} wafers', 'Then, silver electrodes were painted onto sample surfaces and fired at 750 °C for 30 min to form electrodes', 'The samples were then poled with an electric field of 10 kV/cm at 140 °C for 15 min in silicone oil and then slowly cooled to room temperature while electric field was halved'], 'characterization_techniques': ['d 33 meter', 'impedance analyzer', 'ferroelectric analyzer', 'laser vibrometer']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
