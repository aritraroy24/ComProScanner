The material investigated in this experiment is the Nb/Mn co\u2010doped CBT ceramics with the following chemical formula: CaBi4Ti4-x (Nb2/3Mn1/3) x O15 (abbreviated as CBTNM-100x, where x = 0, 0.04, 0.08, 0.12, 0.20). In the present study, the powder was compacted into a bulk of dimensions of 15 mm \xd7 2 mm \xd7 2 mm, and the specimens were poled along the thickness direction. The bending strength of CBTNM ceramics was measured using a three-point bending beam setup with a span of 12 mm and a loading speed of 0.5 mm/min. This measurement was conducted on a dynamic thermomechanical analyzer (DMA, Boss, USA). The fracture strength (\u03c3 m) is calculated using the formula : where, F is the fracture load (maximum applied stress), and b, \u210e, and L represent the width, thickness, and length of the specimen (distance between two supports), respectively. The fracture surface images of the samples were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (Sigma 300, Zeiss). Elemental distribution mappings were obtained using the same SEM equipped with an EDS detector. Additionally, the domain structures were examined via TEM and HRTEM (JEM-ARM200F). The compression test was conducted using an electric universal testing machine (AGS-X-10kN, SHIMADZU, Japan). A 1 MPa preload was applied to the specimen to ensure its stability during testing. The procedure was carried out under displacement control, maintaining a stroke rate of 1 mm/min. An extensometer with a 10 mm gauge length was mounted on both sides of the specimen to measure its macroscopic strain. The material's compression failure point, defined as its compression strength (\u03c3 cf), was determined through the recorded data and calculated using the following formula: where, P is the crushing load (N), and S is the cross-sectional area of the specimen (mmE^{2}). The multi-field coupling uniaxial compression test on CBTNM ceramics was performed to evaluate the material behavior under simultaneous mechanical, electrical, and thermal condition. This assessment utilizes a sophisticated setup involving various control systems as illustrated in (a1-a3). A specialized tubular alumina heater with operating temperatures from 0 \xb0C to 500 \xb0C, was integrated into the system to provide a controlled thermal environment for the specimens. The high voltage DC power (0 kV\u201320 kV) supplied by a voltage control system could be applied to the specimen with silver paste electrodes.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(b) shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the pristine surface of CBTNM ceramics, depicting the characteristic grain morphology with a plate-like structure. (c1-c6) illustrate the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis of the pristine surface of CBTNM ceramics, showing a homogeneous distribution of the constituent elements (Ca, Bi, Ti, O, Nb, and Mn) throughout the sample. Additionally, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to analyze the domain structures in CBTNM-12 ceramics, as shown in (d1). This analysis reveals numerous small layered domain walls on the surface of plate-like grains, ranging in size from approximately 10 nm\u201350 nm, which are similar to the ferroelectric domain patterns seen in other bismuth layer-structured ferroelectrics. (d2) presents a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of CBTNM-12 ceramics viewed along the [110] zone axis. This image experimentally demonstrates the layered crystal structure of CBT ceramics, featuring periodic stripe-like patterns without any dislocations in the examined area. The atomic-scale details of the crystal structure clearly show the positions of the Bi2O2 and TiO6 layers and their interleaved arrangement along the c-axis. Combined with the fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern, it reveals that the lattice spacing of d (002) is 2.037 nm, which is approximately half of the c-axis lattice parameter. presents the piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) at room temperature and the ferroelectric residual polarization (2P r) measured at 1 Hz and 180 \xb0C for CBTNM-100x ceramics. The d 33 value initially increases and then decreases with increasing doping content, reaching a peak of 26.8 pC/N in CBTNM-12 ceramics. The 2P r value shows a consistent upward trend with increased doping, reaching a maximum of 19.9 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at x = 0.12. Further details on the electrical performance can be found in our previous work. (a) illustrates the fracture strength of CBTNM ceramics with varying doping levels. To examine the fracture characteristics of CBTNM ceramics with different doping levels, SEM was employed to observe their fracture surfaces. The overall fracture morphology is depicted in (b1-b5). The undoped CBTNM-0 exhibits a smooth fracture surface, indicative of a homogeneous and intact microstructure that contributes to its higher fracture strength. However, with the introduction of dopants, micro-defects such as pores appear on the fracture surface, especially in samples with moderate doping levels, as shown in (b2-b5), which adversely affect the fracture strength. Additionally, both transgranular and intergranular fracture modes are present in all specimens, as illustrated in (c1-c3). This observation suggests that CBTNM ceramics primarily exhibit mixed failure modes, and doping does not alter their fracture modes. Previous research on CBTNM ceramics has shown that as doping content increases, grain size initially increases and then decreases, while relative density first decreases and then increases. Therefore, the initial decrease in fracture strength is associated with increased grain size and decreased relative density, whereas the subsequent increase in fracture strength is due to decreased grain size and increased relative density of CBTNM ceramics. This indicates that grain size, defects, and densification are key factors influencing the fracture behavior of CBTNM ceramics with varying doping levels. (a) displays the stress-strain response curves of CBTNM ceramics under uniaxial compression with varying doping contents. This behavior is predominantly governed by ferroelastic deformation, arising from non-180\xb0 domain switching during the mechanical loading. According to the polarization switch model proposed by Hwang et al. , the switch occurs when the product of the stress tensor \u03c3 ij and the switching strain tensor \u0394 \u03b5 ij meets the criterion:  Threshold energy 2 Ps Ec (Ps, the magnitude of spontaneous polarization, Ec, the coercive field) for polarization switching is given in this expression. In this context, the typical domain wall movement involves non-180\xb0 domain switching (such as 90\xb0 domain switching) , as illustrated in the inset of (a). In contrast, 180\xb0 domain switching does not significantly alter the internal stress or domain shape, and thus it is not a major contributor to the observed nonlinearity. With the further increase of compressive stress, non-180\xb0 domain switching gradually reaches its maximum with an induced strain, and the stress-strain curve transitions to linear deformation. The domain-induced strain is obtained by simply subtracting the elastic strain from the total strain. (b) illustrates the total strain (dashed line curve), elastic strain (black line curve), and domain-induced strain resulting from non-180\xb0 domain switching (solid line curve) of CBTNM ceramics under uniaxial compressive stress, across varying doping levels. From (b1), it is evident that the strain curves of CBTNM ceramics can be segmented into two parts, OA and AB. In the OA segment, the domain-induced strain component is higher than the elastic strain component (solid line above black line), indicating that the total strain is predominantly influenced by deformation due to domain switching. In the AB segment the elastic strain component linearly increases with stress and surpasses the domain-induced strain component, signifying that elastic deformation primarily dictates the total strain in this segment. Moreover, the critical stress for these two deformation mechanisms depends on the doping level in CBTNM ceramics. Specifically, the critical stress for the different dominating deformation mechanisms varies with the B-site Nb/Mn doping level, with low doping levels dropping to 80.56 MPa, and high doping levels reaching up to 110.87 MPa. These experimental outcomes suggest that the deformation behavior of CBTNM ceramics can be effectively modulated through doping levels, potentially related to changes in the microstructure of CBT-based piezoelectric ceramics, such as domains and crystal structures. (c) presents the variation of domain-induced strain due to domain switching in CBTNM ceramics under uniaxial compressive stress. Saturation stress is defined as the stress level where the curve initially remains parallel to the horizontal axis, indicating the completion of domain switching in the specimen. (d) shows the variation of saturation stress with doping content, revealing that the saturation stress of CBTNM ceramics initially increases and then decreases with increasing doping levels, with CBTNM-20 ceramics exhibiting the lowest saturation stress values (109 MPa). Additionally, the saturation strain (the strain corresponding to the saturation stress) of CBTNM ceramics was analyzed from the curves in (c) and is shown in (e). The saturation strain of CBTNM ceramics varies with doping content, reaching a maximum of 0.32 % for CBTNM-20. In high-doping CBTNM ceramics, the domains are finer, more flexible, and easier to switch compared to those in low-doping CBTNM ceramics. Therefore, the lowest saturation stress observed in CBTNM-20 ceramics suggests an easier domain switching process, which in turn results in a higher saturation strain. (f) also shows the stress-strain curves of CBTNM ceramics derived from elastic deformation for different doping contents, illustrating significant variations in the maximum stress values, indicating that the compressive strength changes with doping content. To better understanding of the relationship between compressive strength and doping content, the compressive strength of CBTNM ceramics with varying doping levels was statistically analyzed, as depicted in (g). The results show that the average compressive strength of CBTNM ceramics initially decreases and then slightly increases with increasing doping content. The lowest compressive strength, observed in the CBTNM-12 sample at 215 MPa, can be attributed to its low density and large grain size. Additionally, compressive strength is related to the ability of CBTNM ceramics to resist elastic deformation. (h) presents the elastic modulus (E = \u03c3/\u03b5) of CBTNM ceramics under uniaxial compression, calculated from the slope of the elastic deformation stress-strain curves in (f). The elastic modulus of CBTNM ceramics depends on their Nb/Mn doping level, with values initially decreasing continuously from 43.29 GPa (CBTNM-0) to 34.13 GPa (CBTNM-12), then increasing to 35.84 GPa (CBTNM-20). These findings suggest that changes in doping content can adjust the resistance of CBTNM ceramics to elastic deformation, potentially due to the alteration in chemical bonding forces caused by the incorporation of doping ions into the lattice. Variations in the ability of CBTNM ceramics to resist elastic deformation might be another significant factor contributing to the differences in compressive strength. To gain a deeper understanding of the mechanical properties and ferroelastic behavior of CBT ceramics, its elastic modulus, compressive strength, fractural strength, saturation stress, and saturation strain were compared with other bismuth-layered structured ferroelectrics (BLSFs), as shown in. CBT exhibits a relatively high elastic modulus and compressive strength; therefore, it has a strong ability to resist elastic deformation and a considerable ability to withstand compression. In terms of fractural strength, the CBT sample exhibits a high value of 76.4 MPa, nearly matching that of CaBi2Nb2O9 and significantly exceeding that of Bi4Ti3O12 (38.0 MPa). This indicates the excellent resistance of CBT ceramics to crack propagation under stress, reinforcing its potential for applications in demanding environments. Furthermore, when comparing the saturation stresses of CBT ceramics and BIT ceramics, it is evident that CBT ceramics possesses a saturation stress level nearly twice as high as that of BIT ceramics. This significant difference suggests that the ferroelastic domains within CBT ceramics are considerably more resistant to switching under applied stress. CBT ceramics also exhibit a reduced saturation strain attributed to such switching events. These comparisons demonstrate that CBT ceramics not only offer balanced mechanical properties but also surpass some counterparts in ferroelastic behavior, making them a promising material for high-temperature piezoelectric applications. To reveal compressive fracture mechanism, shows the morphological characteristics of CBTNM-8 ceramics after uniaxial compression failure. It can be seen that there are three primary types of cracks on the fracture surface of CBTNM ceramics: random cracks ((b1)), longitudinal cracks ( (c1)), and complex intersecting cracks ((d1)). Additionally, microcracks were also observed on the fracture surface ((c3)), playing a crucial role in the fracture process. To mitigate these detrimental effects, it better keep the applied load below coercive stress (such as 50 MPa), which significantly reduces the risk of microcrack initiation and growth, thereby contributing to the stability of piezoelectric performance during practical use. Close examination reveals that the main types of cracks and the microcracks near the fracture surface in CBTNM-8 ceramics exhibit a mixed fracture mode, combining transgranular and intergranular fractures, with transgranular fracture being predominant (as shown in (b2), (c2), (d2), and (c4)). To further understand the ferroelastic behaviors, (a) shows the stress-strain curves of CBTNM ceramics at different cyclic loadings. At the onset of the mechanical loading, a marked non-linearity in the initial cycle of the stress-strain curves is observed for all compositions within the CBTNM ceramics. In an endeavor to precisely quantify the residual strain\u2014decoupled from the recoverable elastic deformation\u2014a non-continuous loading methodology is employed in this experimental setup. In the case of CBTNM-0, the domain switching initiates with a residual strain of 0.12 %, which significantly decreases to a marginal level by the tenth cycle, indicating rapid domain switching stabilization after the initial load. CBTNM-4 and CBTNM-8, with initial domain switching strains of 0.07 % and 0.14 % respectively, also demonstrate a quick reduction, reflecting efficient domain switching realignment within the initial cycle, followed by stabilization. Conversely, CBTNM-12 and CBTNM-20 exhibit substantial initial domain switching strains of 0.27 % and 0.30 %, respectively, denoting a considerable degree of irreversible domain switching during the first cycle. (c) outlines the cumulative residual strain, which tracks the overall permanent deformation resulting from continuous domain switching across the cycling process. CBTNM-0 shows a steady increase in cumulative domain switching strain, reaching about 0.25 %. Both CBTNM-4 and CBTNM-8 show similar trends, initially displaying higher cumulative strains and more extensive domain switching activity compared to CBTNM-0. However, their growth rates slow down over time, ultimately resulting in cumulative strains comparable to CBTNM-0. Remarkably, CBTNM-12 and CBTNM-20 start with noticeable cumulative strains and rise to the highest final values of around 0.45 %, aligning with the significant irreversible domain switching observed initially. These analyses reveal that while all CBTNM compositions undergo domain switching, it is especially pronounced in the initial cycle for CBTNM-12 and CBTNM-20, followed by a significant decline and eventual stabilization. For example, for PZT piezoelectric ceramics, under 150 MPa cyclic compression, the initial residual strain is 0.20 %, and after 10 cycles, the residual strain is 0.24 %. This pronounced domain switching in the initial cycle for CBTNM-12 and CBTNM-20 is due to the increased flexibility of the domains at higher doping levels. To investigate the effect of poling on the mechanical properties and ferroelastic deformation of CBT-based piezoelectric ceramics, uniaxial compression tests were performed on poled CBTNM samples. The stress-strain curves after poling, depicted in (b1-b5), retained a similar profile to those of the unpoled samples, indicating that poling did not eliminate the material's nonlinear behavior and that ferroelastic deformation persisted under mechanical conditions. Further examination of the effect of poling on the ferroelastic behavior of CBTNM ceramics was conducted by comparing the residual strain between poled and unpoled samples. As evidenced in (c), Residual strains (irreversible domain switching strain) in poled CBTNM ceramics display an ascending trend compared to their unpoled counterparts, indicating the impact of the poling process. The poled samples at different doping levels\u2014CBTNM-0, CBTNM-4, CBTNM-8, CBTNM-12, and CBTNM-20\u2014show residual strains of approximately 0.50 %, 0.45 %, 0.65 %, 0.70 %, and 0.85 %, respectively. These values represent an increase of about 0.40 %\u20130.60 % over the residual strains measured in the unpoled ceramics. To discern the influence of poling on the elastic deformation behavior of CBTNM ceramics, the elastic modulus was calculated from the slope of the unloading segment in the stress-strain curves ((b1-b5)). A comparative analysis of the elastic modulus for poled and unpoled CBTNM-100x ceramics as a function of doping content is shown in (d). The CBTNM-0 and CBTNM-4 samples present a dramatic change, each showing a reduction of around 20 GPa after poling, implying a significant alteration in their microstructural rigidity. Meanwhile, the doped CBTNM-12 and CBTNM-20 samples exhibit reductions of 10 GPa, indicating that while the softening effect of poling is evident across all doping levels, it is less pronounced at higher dopant concentrations. This reduction in elastic modulus upon poling is consistent with findings from Fett  and Ende  regarding poled PZT ceramics, which indicated a decrease in the material's ability to resist elastic deformation after poling. Finally, (e) illustrates the comparative compressive strengths of unpoled and poled CBTNM-100x ceramics across various doping levels. The findings are well consistent with the reports in other BIT-based ceramics that the poling effect decreases the mechanical strength by approximately 30 % and further deteriorates the dynamic fatigue properties and cyclic fatigue behaviors. Notably, poled CBTNM-0 ceramics experience pronounced reductions in strength by 128 MPa. In order to reveal the effect of temperature field on uniaxial compression behavior, the stress-strain characterizations of the CBTNM-100x ceramics at different applied temperatures are shown in (a). This reduction in Ec means that the same level of applied stress can more easily induce domain switching, resulting in higher irreversible strain. (b) shows the temperature-dependent residual strain (irreversible domain switching strain) of the CBTNM ceramics. For CBTNM-0, the residual strain increases from approximately 0.16 % at 100 \xb0C to 0.21 % at 500 \xb0C. This indicates increased domain wall mobility at higher temperatures, making it easier for \u03c3 ij\u0394 \u03b5 ij to reach the polarization switching threshold energy. The residual strain for CBTNM-4, CBTNM-8, CBTNM-12, and CBTNM-20 further supports temperature-dependent domain behavior. Each composition exhibits a continuous increase in residual strain with temperature: CBTNM-4 from approximately 0.07 %\u20130.11 %, CBTNM-8 from approximately 0.13 %\u20130.18 %, CBTNM-12 from approximately 0.27 %\u20130.33 %, and CBTNM-20 from approximately 0.30 %\u20130.34 %. These experimental findings align with temperature-dependent domain wall movement behaviors observed in other ferroelectric ceramics, such as increased domain wall movement in PZT ferroelectric thin films at higher temperatures. This also substantiates the nonlinearity and mechanical softening of the CBTNM ceramics from ferroelastic deformation, which could be exacerbated by thermal conditions. (c\u2013e) demonstrate the macroscopic perspective of CBTNM ceramics after uniaxial compression failure at a high temperature of 500 \xb0C. The images reveal that high temperature failure in CBTNM ceramics mainly exhibits two types of cracks: longitudinal cracks ((d1)) and complex intersecting cracks ((e1)). Additionally, microcracks are observed on the fracture surface ((e2)), which is more than that observed at room temperature. At high temperatures, the fracture surfaces show evidence of grain fragmentation ((d2)) and rougher fracture surfaces ((e3)). Compared with the elastic modulus of CBTNM-8 ceramics at room temperature, it reveals a significant difference at high temperatures. For instance, at 500 \xb0C, the elastic modulus is measured at 35.5 GPa, whereas at room temperature, it is 38.6 GPa. To understand the effects of electric field on uniaxial compression behavior in CBTNM ceramics, (a) illustrates the stress-strain behavior of the CBTNM-100x ceramics under different transverse electric fields. The polarization switch model provides a theoretical framework for this behavior, where the mechanical energy combined with the energy from the electric field must surpass a critical threshold for domain switching to occur : where, Ei and \u0394 Pi denote the electric field and change in polarization, respectively. The electric field directly contributes to the energy term Ei\u0394 Pi in the formula, effectively lowering the total energy required to exceed 2 Ps Ec and thus promoting more pronounced domain switching and resulting in greater material deformation. The residual strain for CBTNM-100x ceramics at 1 kV/mm ranges between approximately 0.15 % and 0.25 %. This residual strain escalates to about 0.20 %\u20130.35 % at 2 kV/mm. However, it also implies that the material may experience higher internal stresses, which could affect long-term durability and performance. (c\u2013f) provide a comprehensive view from macroscopic to microscopic level of the fracture surfaces and microstructural deformations in CBTNM ceramics under a transverse electric field of 2 kV/mm. The images reveal that the failure of CBTNM ceramics under applied electric field primarily exhibits two types of cracks: transverse cracks ((d1)) and longitudinal cracks ((e1)). Further magnified observation of the fracture surfaces reveals numerous microcracks ((d2)) forming a web-like structure that is more complex compared to the cracks observed without the electric field. The investigation on PZT and hot pressed PLZT ferroelectric ceramics have been indicated that microcracks and pores act as stress concentration points, playing a crucial role in crack formation under the additional electric field-induced stress. In addition, under the electric field, the fracture surfaces display severe grain fragmentation ((d3) and 8(e2)). Comparing the elastic modulus of CBTNM ceramics without an electric field, it reveals a notable difference at applied electric field. For example, for the CBTNM-8 ceramics under a 2 kV/mm electric field, the measured elastic modulus is 30.7 GPa, whereas it is 38.6 GPa without the electric field. Finally, we examined the simultaneous effects of temperature, electric, mechanical fields (multi-field) on the ferroelastic deformation and mechanical behaviors of CBTNM ceramics. The stress-strain curves in (a1-a5) display significant differences in material behavior under the simultaneous influence of mechanical stress, electric field, and thermal conditions. This complex interaction between stress, electric field, and temperature modifies the internal domain structures, affecting ferroelastic deformation responses of the ceramic materials. (b) illustrates that the residual strain (irreversible domain switching strain) of CBTNM-100x with transverse electric fields of 0\u20131 kV/mm at 20 \xb0C and 200 \xb0C. For each CBTNM ceramics, the residual strain at multi-field (such as 200 \xb0C, 1 kV/mm, and 100 MPa) is consistently higher than that at any single applied field. For example, CBTNM-0 shows an increase in residual strain from approximately 0.20 % at 20 \xb0C to about 0.35 % at 200 \xb0C under a 1 kV/mm electric field. The similar results have been revealed in BaTiO3 and PZT ceramics. (b) also illustrates the effects of different doping contents on ferroelastic deformation at multi-field loading. Under high temperature (200 \xb0C) and electric field (1 kV/mm) conditions, the incremental increase in residual strain decreases with increasing doping levels. For instance, for CBTNM-4, the residual strain is 0.07 % at room temperature without an electric field. Under a transverse electric field of 1 kV/mm at 200 \xb0C, the residual strain increases to 0.26 %, an increase of 2.7 times. For CBTNM-20, the residual strain is 0.27 % at room temperature without an electric field. Under the same conditions of 200 \xb0C and 1 kV/mm transverse electric field, the residual strain increases to 0.38 %, an increase of only 0.4 times. This shows that the residual strain of the low-doped CBTNM ceramics changes more significantly, while the high-doped CBTNM ceramics exhibit a smaller change in residual strain.

In this context, the typical domain wall movement involves non-180\xb0 domain switching (such as 90\xb0 domain switching) , as illustrated in the inset of (a). In contrast, 180\xb0 domain switching does not significantly alter the internal stress or domain shape, and thus it is not a major contributor to the observed nonlinearity. With the further increase of compressive stress, non-180\xb0 domain switching gradually reaches its maximum with an induced strain, and the stress-strain curve transitions to linear deformation. The domain-induced strain is obtained by simply subtracting the elastic strain from the total strain. (b) illustrates the total strain (dashed line curve), elastic strain (black line curve), and domain-induced strain resulting from non-180\xb0 domain switching (solid line curve) of CBTNM ceramics under uniaxial compressive stress, across varying doping levels. From (b1), it is evident that the strain curves of CBTNM ceramics can be segmented into two parts, OA and AB. In the OA segment, the domain-induced strain component is higher than the elastic strain component (solid line above black line), indicating that the total strain is predominantly influenced by deformation due to domain switching. In the AB segment the elastic strain component linearly increases with stress and surpasses the domain-induced strain component, signifying that elastic deformation primarily dictates the total strain in this segment. Moreover, the critical stress for these two deformation mechanisms depends on the doping level in CBTNM ceramics. Specifically, the critical stress for the different dominating deformation mechanisms varies with the B-site Nb/Mn doping level, with low doping levels dropping to 80.56 MPa, and high doping levels reaching up to 110.87 MPa. These experimental outcomes suggest that the deformation behavior of CBTNM ceramics can be effectively modulated through doping levels, potentially related to changes in the microstructure of CBT-based piezoelectric ceramics, such as domains and crystal structures. (c) presents the variation of domain-induced strain due to domain switching in CBTNM ceramics under uniaxial compressive stress. Saturation stress is defined as the stress level where the curve initially remains parallel to the horizontal axis, indicating the completion of domain switching in the specimen. (d) shows the variation of saturation stress with doping content, revealing that the saturation stress of CBTNM ceramics initially increases and then decreases with increasing doping levels, with CBTNM-20 ceramics exhibiting the lowest saturation stress values (109 MPa). Additionally, the saturation strain (the strain corresponding to the saturation stress) of CBTNM ceramics was analyzed from the curves in (c) and is shown in (e). The saturation strain of CBTNM ceramics varies with doping content, reaching a maximum of 0.32 % for CBTNM-20. In high-doping CBTNM ceramics, the domains are finer, more flexible, and easier to switch compared to those in low-doping CBTNM ceramics. Therefore, the lowest saturation stress observed in CBTNM-20 ceramics suggests an easier domain switching process, which in turn results in a higher saturation strain. (f) also shows the stress-strain curves of CBTNM ceramics derived from elastic deformation for different doping contents, illustrating significant variations in the maximum stress values, indicating that the compressive strength changes with doping content. To better understanding of the relationship between compressive strength and doping content, the compressive strength of CBTNM ceramics with varying doping levels was statistically analyzed, as depicted in (g). The results show that the average compressive strength of CBTNM ceramics initially decreases and then slightly increases with increasing doping content. The lowest compressive strength, observed in the CBTNM-12 sample at 215 MPa, can be attributed to its low density and large grain size. Additionally, compressive strength is related to the ability of CBTNM ceramics to resist elastic deformation. (h) presents the elastic modulus (E = \u03c3/\u03b5) of CBTNM ceramics under uniaxial compression, calculated from the slope of the elastic deformation stress-strain curves in (f). The elastic modulus of CBTNM ceramics depends on their Nb/Mn doping level, with values initially decreasing continuously from 43.29 GPa (CBTNM-0) to 34.13 GPa (CBTNM-12), then increasing to 35.84 GPa (CBTNM-20). These findings suggest that changes in doping content can adjust the resistance of CBTNM ceramics to elastic deformation, potentially due to the alteration in chemical bonding forces caused by the incorporation of doping ions into the lattice. Variations in the ability of CBTNM ceramics to resist elastic deformation might be another significant factor contributing to the differences in compressive strength. To gain a deeper understanding of the mechanical properties and ferroelastic behavior of CBT ceramics, its elastic modulus, compressive strength, fractural strength, saturation stress, and saturation strain were compared with other bismuth-layered structured ferroelectrics (BLSFs), as shown in. CBT exhibits a relatively high elastic modulus and compressive strength; therefore, it has a strong ability to resist elastic deformation and a considerable ability to withstand compression. In terms of fractural strength, the CBT sample exhibits a high value of 76.4 MPa, nearly matching that of CaBi2Nb2O9 and significantly exceeding that of Bi4Ti3O12 (38.0 MPa). This indicates the excellent resistance of CBT ceramics to crack propagation under stress, reinforcing its potential for applications in demanding environments. Furthermore, when comparing the saturation stresses of CBT ceramics and BIT ceramics, it is evident that CBT ceramics possesses a saturation stress level nearly twice as high as that of BIT ceramics. This significant difference suggests that the ferroelastic domains within CBT ceramics are considerably more resistant to switching under applied stress. CBT ceramics also exhibit a reduced saturation strain attributed to such switching events. These comparisons demonstrate that CBT ceramics not only offer balanced mechanical properties but also surpass some counterparts in ferroelastic behavior, making them a promising material for high-temperature piezoelectric applications. To reveal compressive fracture mechanism, shows the morphological characteristics of CBTNM-8 ceramics after uniaxial compression failure. It can be seen that there are three primary types of cracks on the fracture surface of CBTNM ceramics: random cracks ((b1)), longitudinal cracks ( (c1)), and complex intersecting cracks ((d1)). Additionally, microcracks were also observed on the fracture surface ((c3)), playing a crucial role in the fracture process. To mitigate these detrimental effects, it better keep the applied load below coercive stress (such as 50 MPa), which significantly reduces the risk of microcrack initiation and growth, thereby contributing to the stability of piezoelectric performance during practical use. Close examination reveals that the main types of cracks and the microcracks near the fracture surface in CBTNM-8 ceramics exhibit a mixed fracture mode, combining transgranular and intergranular fractures, with transgranular fracture being predominant (as shown in (b2), (c2), (d2), and (c4)). To further understand the ferroelastic behaviors, (a) shows the stress-strain curves of CBTNM ceramics at different cyclic loadings. At the onset of the mechanical loading, a marked non-linearity in the initial cycle of the stress-strain curves is observed for all compositions within the CBTNM ceramics. In an endeavor to precisely quantify the residual strain\u2014decoupled from the recoverable elastic deformation\u2014a non-continuous loading methodology is employed in this experimental setup. In the case of CBTNM-0, the domain switching initiates with a residual strain of 0.12 %, which significantly decreases to a marginal level by the tenth cycle, indicating rapid domain switching stabilization after the initial load. CBTNM-4 and CBTNM-8, with initial domain switching strains of 0.07 % and 0.14 % respectively, also demonstrate a quick reduction, reflecting efficient domain switching realignment within the initial cycle, followed by stabilization. Conversely, CBTNM-12 and CBTNM-20 exhibit substantial initial domain switching strains of 0.27 % and 0.30 %, respectively, denoting a considerable degree of irreversible domain switching during the first cycle. (c) outlines the cumulative residual strain, which tracks the overall permanent deformation resulting from continuous domain switching across the cycling process. CBTNM-0 shows a steady increase in cumulative domain switching strain, reaching about 0.25 %. Both CBTNM-4 and CBTNM-8 show similar trends, initially displaying higher cumulative strains and more extensive domain switching activity compared to CBTNM-0. However, their growth rates slow down over time, ultimately resulting in cumulative strains comparable to CBTNM-0. Remarkably, CBTNM-12 and CBTNM-20 start with noticeable cumulative strains and rise to the highest final values of around 0.45 %, aligning with the significant irreversible domain switching observed initially. These analyses reveal that while all CBTNM compositions undergo domain switching, it is especially pronounced in the initial cycle for CBTNM-12 and CBTNM-20, followed by a significant decline and eventual stabilization. For example, for PZT piezoelectric ceramics, under 150 MPa cyclic compression, the initial residual strain is 0.20 %, and after 10 cycles, the residual strain is 0.24 %. This pronounced domain switching in the initial cycle for CBTNM-12 and CBTNM-20 is due to the increased flexibility of the domains at higher doping levels. To investigate the effect of poling on the mechanical properties and ferroelastic deformation of CBT-based piezoelectric ceramics, uniaxial compression tests were performed on poled CBTNM samples. The stress-strain curves after poling, depicted in (b1-b5), retained a similar profile to those of the unpoled samples, indicating that poling did not eliminate the material's nonlinear behavior and that ferroelastic deformation persisted under mechanical conditions. Further examination of the effect of poling on the ferroelastic behavior of CBTNM ceramics was conducted by comparing the residual strain between poled and unpoled samples. As evidenced in (c), Residual strains (irreversible domain switching strain) in poled CBTNM ceramics display an ascending trend compared to their unpoled counterparts, indicating the impact of the poling process. The poled samples at different doping levels\u2014CBTNM-0, CBTNM-4, CBTNM-8, CBTNM-12, and CBTNM-20\u2014show residual strains of approximately 0.50 %, 0.45 %, 0.65 %, 0.70 %, and 0.85 %, respectively. These values represent an increase of about 0.40 %\u20130.60 % over the residual strains measured in the unpoled ceramics. To discern the influence of poling on the elastic deformation behavior of CBTNM ceramics, the elastic modulus was calculated from the slope of the unloading segment in the stress-strain curves ((b1-b5)). A comparative analysis of the elastic modulus for poled and unpoled CBTNM-100x ceramics as a function of doping content is shown in (d). The CBTNM-0 and CBTNM-4 samples present a dramatic change, each showing a reduction of around 20 GPa after poling, implying a significant alteration in their microstructural rigidity. Meanwhile, the doped CBTNM-12 and CBTNM-20 samples exhibit reductions of 10 GPa, indicating that while the softening effect of poling is evident across all doping levels, it is less pronounced at higher dopant concentrations. This reduction in elastic modulus upon poling is consistent with findings from Fett  and Ende  regarding poled PZT ceramics, which indicated a decrease in the material's ability to resist elastic deformation after poling. Finally, (e) illustrates the comparative compressive strengths of unpoled and poled CBTNM-100x ceramics across various doping levels. The findings are well consistent with the reports in other BIT-based ceramics that the poling effect decreases the mechanical strength by approximately 30 % and further deteriorates the dynamic fatigue properties and cyclic fatigue behaviors. Notably, poled CBTNM-0 ceramics experience pronounced reductions in strength by 128 MPa. In order to reveal the effect of temperature field on uniaxial compression behavior, the stress-strain characterizations of the CBTNM-100x ceramics at different applied temperatures are shown in (a). This reduction in Ec means that the same level of applied stress can more easily induce domain switching, resulting in higher irreversible strain. (b) shows the temperature-dependent residual strain (irreversible domain switching strain) of the CBTNM ceramics. For CBTNM-0, the residual strain increases from approximately 0.16 % at 100 \xb0C to 0.21 % at 500 \xb0C. This indicates increased domain wall mobility at higher temperatures, making it easier for \u03c3 ij\u0394 \u03b5 ij to reach the polarization switching threshold energy. The residual strain for CBTNM-4, CBTNM-8, CBTNM-12, and CBTNM-20 further supports temperature-dependent domain behavior. Each composition exhibits a continuous increase in residual strain with temperature: CBTNM-4 from approximately 0.07 %\u20130.11 %, CBTNM-8 from approximately 0.13 %\u20130.18 %, CBTNM-12 from approximately 0.27 %\u20130.33 %, and CBTNM-20 from approximately 0.30 %\u20130.34 %. These experimental findings align with temperature-dependent domain wall movement behaviors observed in other ferroelectric ceramics, such as increased domain wall movement in PZT ferroelectric thin films at higher temperatures. This also substantiates the nonlinearity and mechanical softening of the CBTNM ceramics from ferroelastic deformation, which could be exacerbated by thermal conditions. (c\u2013e) demonstrate the macroscopic perspective of CBTNM ceramics after uniaxial compression failure at a high temperature of 500 \xb0C. The images reveal that high temperature failure in CBTNM ceramics mainly exhibits two types of cracks: longitudinal cracks ((d1)) and complex intersecting cracks ((e1)). Additionally, microcracks are observed on the fracture surface ((e2)), which is more than that observed at room temperature. At high temperatures, the fracture surfaces show evidence of grain fragmentation ((d2)) and rougher fracture surfaces ((e3)). Compared with the elastic modulus of CBTNM-8 ceramics at room temperature, it reveals a significant difference at high temperatures. For instance, at 500 \xb0C, the elastic modulus is measured at 35.5 GPa, whereas at room temperature, it is 38.6 GPa. To understand the effects of electric field on uniaxial compression behavior in CBTNM ceramics, (a) illustrates the stress-strain behavior of the CBTNM-100x ceramics under different transverse electric fields. The polarization switch model provides a theoretical framework for this behavior, where the mechanical energy combined with the energy from the electric field must surpass a critical threshold for domain switching to occur : where, Ei and \u0394 Pi denote the electric field and change in polarization, respectively. The electric field directly contributes to the energy term Ei\u0394 Pi in the formula, effectively lowering the total energy required to exceed 2 Ps Ec and thus promoting more pronounced domain switching and resulting in greater material deformation. The residual strain for CBTNM-100x ceramics at 1 kV/mm ranges between approximately 0.15 % and 0.25 %. This residual strain escalates to about 0.20 %\u20130.35 % at 2 kV/mm. However, it also implies that the material may experience higher internal stresses, which could affect long-term durability and performance. (c\u2013f) provide a comprehensive view from macroscopic to microscopic level of the fracture surfaces and microstructural deformations in CBTNM ceramics under a transverse electric field of 2 kV/mm. The images reveal that the failure of CBTNM ceramics under applied electric field primarily exhibits two types of cracks: transverse cracks ((d1)) and longitudinal cracks ((e1)). Further magnified observation of the fracture surfaces reveals numerous microcracks ((d2)) forming a web-like structure that is more complex compared to the cracks observed without the electric field. The investigation on PZT and hot pressed PLZT ferroelectric ceramics have been indicated that microcracks and pores act as stress concentration points, playing a crucial role in crack formation under the additional electric field-induced stress. In addition, under the electric field, the fracture surfaces display severe grain fragmentation ((d3) and 8(e2)). Comparing the elastic modulus of CBTNM ceramics without an electric field, it reveals a notable difference at applied electric field. For example, for the CBTNM-8 ceramics under a 2 kV/mm electric field, the measured elastic modulus is 30.7 GPa, whereas it is 38.6 GPa without the electric field. Finally, we examined the simultaneous effects of temperature, electric, mechanical fields (multi-field) on the ferroelastic deformation and mechanical behaviors of CBTNM ceramics. The stress-strain curves in (a1-a5) display significant differences in material behavior under the simultaneous influence of mechanical stress, electric field, and thermal conditions. This complex interaction between stress, electric field, and temperature modifies the internal domain structures, affecting ferroelastic deformation responses of the ceramic materials. (b) illustrates that the residual strain (irreversible domain switching strain) of CBTNM-100x with transverse electric fields of 0\u20131 kV/mm at 20 \xb0C and 200 \xb0C. For each CBTNM ceramics, the residual strain at multi-field (such as 200 \xb0C, 1 kV/mm, and 100 MPa) is consistently higher than that at any single applied field. For example, CBTNM-0 shows an increase in residual strain from approximately 0.20 % at 20 \xb0C to about 0.35 % at 200 \xb0C under a 1 kV/mm electric field. The similar results have been revealed in BaTiO3 and PZT ceramics. (b) also illustrates the effects of different doping contents on ferroelastic deformation at multi-field loading. Under high temperature (200 \xb0C) and electric field (1 kV/mm) conditions, the incremental increase in residual strain decreases with increasing doping levels. For instance, for CBTNM-4, the residual strain is 0.07 % at room temperature without an electric field. Under a transverse electric field of 1 kV/mm at 200 \xb0C, the residual strain increases to 0.26 %, an increase of 2.7 times. For CBTNM-20, the residual strain is 0.27 % at room temperature without an electric field. Under the same conditions of 200 \xb0C and 1 kV/mm transverse electric field, the residual strain increases to 0.38 %, an increase of only 0.4 times. This shows that the residual strain of the low-doped CBTNM ceramics changes more significantly, while the high-doped CBTNM ceramics exhibit a smaller change in residual strain.
