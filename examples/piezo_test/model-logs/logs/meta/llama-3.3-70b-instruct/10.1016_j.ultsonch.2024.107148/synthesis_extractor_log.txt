In this section, an integrated sandwich HPUT is introduced, and its structure is shown in , which consists of the damping back cover, piezoelectric ceramic stack, flange plate, amplifying front cover, fixture rod, and tool rod. The HPUT\u2019s structure and electromechanical equivalent circuit are shown in , where Z i 1, Z i 2, Z i 3 and Z i 4 (i represents 1, 2, 3, and 4) are defined as the impedances of the damping back cover, flange plate, fixture rod, and tool rod, respectively; Z e 1, Z e 2, and Z e 3 represent the impedances of the exponential amplifying front cover; Z fl and Z bl represents the front radiant impedance, back radiant impedance of the transducer, respectively. The impedances of HPUT\u2019s damping back cover, flange plate, fixture rod, and tool rod are calculated by where \u03c1 1, \u03c1 2, \u03c1 3, and \u03c1 4 are the density of the damping back cover, flange plate, fixture rod, and tool rod, respectively. The impedance of exponential amplifying front cover is calculated by where \u03c1e , ce , Se 1, Se 2, ke , k e\u2032 and le are the density, longitudinal ultrasonic speed, the largest and the smallest cross-section areas, circular wavenumber, equivalent circular wave number and thickness of the exponential amplifying front cover. Essentially, Z fl represents the effect of the thermo-mechanical coupling load which ultimately acts on piezoelectric stacks and causes HPUT\u2019s resonance frequency drift. The piezoelectric stack consisting of several piezoelectric rings adopts the k 33 vibration mode. (a) shows that each piezoelectric ceramic ring adopts the k 33 vibration mode which keeps the direction of electric field, vibration, and polarization parallel to the z-axis. Therefore, the piezoelectric ceramic ring is only subjected to axial stress X 3 and axial electric field E 3, namely X 3 \u2260 0 and E 3 \u2260 0. The piezoelectric equation of a piezoelectric ceramic ring is expressed as where x3, D3, d33, s 33E, and \u03b5 33X is the axial strain, axial electric displacement, piezoelectric strain constant, short-circuit elastic compliance constant, and free dielectric constant, respectively. According to the piezoelectric equation, a six-terminal electromechanical equivalent equation of single piezoelectric ceramic ring excited by the simple harmonic alternating current is expressed as where F p1 and F p2 are the force of two ends of the piezoelectric ceramic ring, respectively; Vp and Ip is the input voltage and current, respectively;\u03be\u0307 p1 and \u03be\u0307 p2 is the vibration speed of two ends of the piezoelectric ceramic ring, respectively; Sp, \u03c1p, cp, \u03c4, and kp are the cross-section area, density, longitudinal ultrasonic speed, thickness and circular wavenumber of the piezoelectric ring, respectively;n= Sp d33/\u03c4 s 33E and C0 = Sp\u03b5 33x/\u03c4 represent the electromechanical turn ratio and clamped capacitance of piezoelectric ring in which \u03b5 33x represents the clamped dielectric constant. Based on the connection mode of mechanical series and circuit parallel , the electromechanical equivalent topology of piezoelectric ceramic stack including m piezoelectric ceramic rings is shown in (b), where Fp ( m+ 1) and \u03be\u0307 p(m+1) is the force, vibration speed of the right end of No.m piezoelectric ceramic ring, respectively; Z 1 p , Z 2 p , and Z 3 p are the impedance of piezoelectric ceramic stack which can be calculated by where c pe and k pe is the longitudinal ultrasonic speed and equivalent circular wavenumber of piezoelectric stacks. Therefore, the electromechanical equivalent model in (b) is generally used to design HPUT\u2019s initial dimensions. When the loss factor is less than 0.1, the comparatively accurate complex loss factor model of piezoelectric transducers used for the precision control of the resonance tracking and constant amplitude , is expressed as where tan \u03b4\u2032, \u03b4\u2032, tan \u03d5\u2032, \u03d5\u2032, tan \u03b8\u2032 and \u03b8\u2032 represent the dielectric loss factor, dielectric loss angle, elastic loss factor, elastic loss angle, piezoelectric loss factor, and piezoelectric loss angle of piezoelectric stacks without the additional load, respectively. The parameters of the dielectric loss factor, dielectric loss angle, elastic loss factor, elastic loss angle, piezoelectric loss factor, and piezoelectric loss angle of the piezoelectric ceramic stack with the thermo-mechanical coupling load is expressed as where F, T, and Tb are the force, operating temperature, and ambient temperature of an external thermo-mechanical coupling load, respectively;a 1m and a 1t is the mechanical load factor, thermal load factor of dielectric constant, respectively;a 2m and a 2t is the mechanical load factor, thermal load factor of elastic constant, respectively; a 3m and a 3t is the mechanical load factor, thermal load factor of piezoelectric constant, respectively; b 1m and b 1t is the mechanical load factor, thermal load factor of dielectric loss, respectively; b 2m and b 2t is the mechanical load factor, thermal load factor of elastic loss, respectively; b 3m and b 3t is the mechanical load factor, thermal load factor of piezoelectric loss, respectively. Therefore, based on equations (6) and (7), the complex dielectric constant, the complex elastic constant, and the complex piezoelectric constant under the thermo-mechanical coupling load are expressed as  The complex forms of the clamped capacitance, electromechanical turn ratio, wave velocity, and wavenumber of a piezoelectric ring under the thermo-mechanical coupling load are expressed as where C 0_Tm represents the energy storage capacitance, R 0_Tm represents the dielectric loss, n Tm represents the real part of the electromechanical turn ratio,c Tm represents the real part of wave velocity, k Tm represents the real part of wavenumber, \u03c6 Tm= \u03b8 Tm\u2032- \u03d5 Tm\u2032 represents the phase shift. All of them can be calculated by  The electromechanical equivalent impedance of piezoelectric stacks under the thermo-mechanical coupling load is expressed as where the R 1p_Tm and R 3p_Tm represent the equivalent mechanical losses; X 1p_Tm and X 3p_Tm represent the equivalent mechanical energy storage. Therefore, the simplified solution equations of R 1p_Tm, R 3p_Tm,X 1p_Tm and X 3p_Tm are expressed as  In this section, based on HPUT\u2019s thermo-mechanical coupling load model, a high-frequency piezoelectric transducer was designed. The damping back cover, piezoelectric ceramic stack, flange plate, amplifying front cover, fixture rod, and tool rod are combined into a whole with a high-strength bolt made of 45-gauge steel. The main parameters of PZT-8 piezoelectric ceramic measured by impedance analyzer and LCR meter are shown in. HPUT\u2019s design geometric dimensions are shown in. When the temperature is less than 100\xb0C, the loss factor, dielectric constant, piezoelectric constant, and elastic constant increase approximately linearly with the temperature increasing. Therefore, to avoid the nonlinear effect of piezoelectric ceramic, the temperature of thermo-mechanical coupling load is limited to 25\u201395\xb0C. Besides, considering high-frequency working state, the force of thermo-mechanical coupling load is limited to 0\u201340 N. HPUT\u2019s electromechanical equivalent circuit under thermo-mechanical coupling loads includes pure electrical parameters and equivalent electromechanical parameters simultaneously. Therefore, for convenience of further electrical analysis, the total impedance of HPUT\u2019s electromechanical equivalent circuit based on Kirchhoff\u2019s law can be expressed as where Re= R 0_Tm/m, Ze=1/j\u03c9 Ce, Ce=m C 0_Tm, Zm= R 3p_Tm+j X 3p_Tm+ Zb Z f1/ ( Zb +Z f1), Zb= Z12+ R 1p_Tm+j X 1p_Tm+ Z13 ( Z11+ Z bl)/ ( Z13+ Z11+ Z bl), Z f1= Z21+ R 1p_Tm+j X 1p_Tm+ Z23 ( Z22+ Z f2)/ ( Z23+ Z22+ Z f2), Z f2= Z e1+ Z e3 ( Z e2+ Z f3)/ ( Z e3+ Z e2+ Z f3), Z f3= Z31+ Z33 ( Z32+ Z f4)/ ( Z33+ Z32+ Z f4), Z f4= Z41+ Z43 ( Z42+ Z fl)/ ( Z43+ Z42+ Z fl). Based on equation (12), the simplified Butterworth-Van Dyke equivalent circuit of piezoelectric transducer is shown in (a), where R e, C e, L m, C m, and R m are the electrical resistance, clamped capacitance, motional inductance, motional capacitance, and motional resistance, respectively. Compared the impedance change trend of (a) with that of (c), the change trend of impedance caused by thermal load is approximately linear when temperature is lower than 75\xb0C, but the overall change trend of impedance caused by force load is approximately exponential. Especially, when force is less than 10 N, the impedance change caused by force load is dramatically. Besides, (b) shows that when the force exceeds 20 N, the phase quality is starting to deteriorate seriously. According to the series frequency f s and its corresponding impedance Z s, the parallel resonance frequency f p and its corresponding impedance Z p, the effective electromechanical coupling coefficient K eff can be obtained by  Besides, according to the admittance curve, the mechanical quality factor Q m can be calculated by where (\u0394f s)3dB is the bandwidth corresponding to the decrease of 3 dB in the absolute value of the admittance. Based on the Eq. (13), the clamped capacitance C e of piezoelectric transducer can be calculated by and the motional resistance R m can be obtained by  In this section, the designed high-frequency piezoelectric ultrasonic transducer is measured to verify the proposed thermo-mechanical coupling load model under different axial forces and temperatures. However, with the increases in the input voltage, the vibration amplitude first increases and then decreases, but once the input voltage exceeds 52 V, the vibration amplitude begins to increase slowly. Therefore, the vibration amplitude increases with the input electrical apparent power under the condition of input voltage less than 45 V. To explain this phenomenon, is divided into light blue region (5\u201320 V), light purple region (20\u201345 V), and light brown region (45\u201360 V). The temperature rise of the light blue region is less than 41.6\xb0C, and the thermal effect is dominated by mechanical vibration loss. The temperature rise of the light purple region is less than 90.3\xb0C, so the piezoelectric transducer can still operate safely. The temperature rise of the light purple region exceeds 90.3\xb0C, so the HPUT cannot operate safely without the forced cooling systems. Therefore, the maximum power without forced cooling systems is about 59 W, where the vibration amplitude is approximately 2.6 \u03bcm. Finally, the experimental temperature range is set below 95\xb0C. Besides, the experimental environment temperature and humidity are 25\xb0C and 46 %, respectively. However, the contour gradient changes irregularly when the force is greater than 15 N, which indicates that the performance of the high-frequency piezoelectric ceramic transducer deteriorates and cannot remain stable. In addition, the gradient change of the contour line also shows an irregular state when the temperature is higher than 75\xb0C, indicating that the resonant frequency drifting of the high-frequency piezoelectric ceramic transducer is a nonlinear change at high temperatures. When the temperature is in the range of 25\u201375\xb0C and the force is in the range of 0\u201315 N, the contour projection gradient changes uniformly, indicating that the f s and f p change approximately linearly with temperature and axial pressure which verified the accuracy of the theoretical analysis. In addition, the parameters of C e, R m, Q m, and K eff are also of great significance for evaluating HPUT\u2019s performance. As shown in (a), when the force is greater than 10 N or the temperature is greater than 70\xb0C, the capacitance value of the static capacitor C e oscillatively increases with the increase of temperature and force, and overall, the fluctuation amplitude of the C e value is relatively stable. According to the projection distribution of its contour gradients, when the force is less than 10 N and the temperature is less than 70\xb0C, the C e value increases approximately linearly with the increase of temperature and force, and it should be noted that the fluctuation amplitude of the C e value is relatively larger when the force is less than 2 N and the temperature is less than 35\xb0C. Overall, when the force is less than 15 N and the temperature is less than 65\xb0C, the contour gradients are relatively uniform where the R m increases approximately linearly with increasing temperature and force, and the maximum value of R m does not exceed 120 \u03a9. Besides, when the force is greater than 15 N and the temperature is greater than 40\xb0C, the Q m value is basically less than 100 which indicates that the transducer has a worse operating state in this region. But when the force is less than 10 N and the temperature is less than 60\xb0C, the Q m value is basically greater than 150 and performs high stability. When the force is less than 10 N and the temperature is less than 60\xb0C, the projection distribution of contour gradients indicates that the K eff is relatively stable, approximately equal to 30 %. Overall, the experimental results indicate that the parameters of f s, f p, C e, R m, Q m, and K eff have a strong linear relationship with the change of axial force and temperature when the force is less than 10 N and the temperature is in the range of 35\u201360\xb0C, which verify the validity of theoretical inferences. To accurately predict the resonance frequency when the force is less than 10 N, further shows the linear fitting relationship between resonance frequency and force load under the conditions of constant operating temperature. (a) shows that the series resonance frequency f s linearly increases with the force load approximately. Comparing the linear fitting curves under temperature conditions of 50\xb0C and 60\xb0C, it can be observed that a temperature frequency drifting of up to 370 Hz between the two, which further indicates that temperature fluctuations have an undeniable impact on frequency drift. In addition, the slope of 50\xb0C linear fitting line is slightly larger than that of 60\xb0C linear fitting line. Comparing the change trends of f s and f p under the condition of 50\xb0C, the slope difference is about 0.011, which indicates that the frequency tracking non-interference bandwidth \u0394f (f p\u2013f s) slowly increases with the force load; Simultaneously, the slope difference of f s and f p under the condition of 60\xb0C is about 0.005, which indicates that the frequency tracking non-interference bandwidth \u0394f more slowly increase with the force load than that of 50\xb0C condition. Overall, the interference influence of the thermo-mechanical coupling load on the frequency tracking non-interference bandwidth \u0394f can be ignored.

Comparing the change trends of f s and f p under the condition of 50\xb0C, the slope difference is about 0.011, which indicates that the frequency tracking non-interference bandwidth \u0394f (f p\u2013f s) slowly increases with the force load; Simultaneously, the slope difference of f s and f p under the condition of 60\xb0C is about 0.005, which indicates that the frequency tracking non-interference bandwidth \u0394f more slowly increase with the force load than that of 50\xb0C condition. Overall, the interference influence of the thermo-mechanical coupling load on the frequency tracking non-interference bandwidth \u0394f can be ignored.

- For precursors, just use the chemical name (no company or purity) and for characterization_techniques, only the instrument name or short name of the instrument for the instruments like XRD, Raman Spectroscopy, SEM, TEM etc.
- For synthesis_methods, use the short name of the method if possible, else write the full name and don't use method/reaction word at the end.
- For precursors, just use the chemical composition (if available) else chemical name (no company or purity)
- For characterization_techniques, try using short name of the characterization techniques like XRD, Raman Spectroscopy, SEM, TEM etc. if possible, else write the full name.
