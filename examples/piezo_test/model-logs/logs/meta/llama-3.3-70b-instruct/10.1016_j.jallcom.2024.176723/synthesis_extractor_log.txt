AlN thin films were deposited by DC reactive magnetron sputtering (Nordiko Ltd, UK) from a 100 \xd7 300 mmE^{2} Al target (99.99 % purity) using N2 and Ar as process gases. The layers were deposited on 0.80-inch single side polished (100)-oriented Si substrates (from University Wafer\xae). Prior to each deposition, substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic cleaning system (UCS, from Optimal Technologies\xae) consisting in a series of ultrasonic baths, comprising: (i) 5 minutes in Decon neutracon\xae solvent (anionic and non-ionic active surface agents in an aqueous polyhydric alcohol base); (ii) 5 minutes in WashBryte\xae solvent: 15\u201330 % anionic surfactants; (iii) 5 minutes in deionized (DI) water. Finally, substrates were dried under N2 flow and loaded into the deposition system under a residual pressure around 10E^{\u22127} mbar, to prevent air contamination. Prior to each deposition, and with the shutter covering the substrate set in close position, the Al target was cleaned in pure Ar (flow of 30 sccm) at 300 W for 10 min to remove potential oxygen contamination from the surface, followed by 5 min carried out in a reactive atmosphere (i.e., Ar/N2 plasma) to reach stable reactive conditions of the plasma, the latter similar to that used during the depositions. The deposition series have been planned via DoE through R-code software (R 4.2.1 version, from Bell Laboratories Inc.) , using magnetron power, N2 gas flow, and Ar gas flow as key input variables (KIV). In this work, DoE approach involving the utilization of an upper and lower limit of each growth parameter i.e., 2-levels study was used, that corresponds therefore to a linear modelling. Specifically, AlN thin films were deposited using magnetron powers of 70 and 400 W, and Ar & N2 flows of 20 and 40 sccm limits as summarized in. Sample S5 has not been carried out since plasma was not stable under those conditions. The thicknesses of the deposited layers, and hence the deposition rate , were obtained by profilometry (Dektak 3ST surface profilometer from Veeco\xae). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) have been carried out in a VEGA 4 from Tescan to study the film morphology and the elemental composition, respectively, operating at 5 keV and 300 pA. The film crystallinity has been studied by XRD using a Siemens D5000 X-Ray diffractometer (Cu K\u03b1, 1.5406 \xc5) at 40 kV/30 mA. The measures were performed in the thin films, in symmetric diffraction geometry, collecting Bragg reflections with a 2D detector. The XRD analysis has been carried out using PANalytical X\u2019Pert HighScore Plus software. In addition, TEM studies have been carried out in a FEI Talos F200X microscope, operating at 200 keV and working in bright field (BF) and dark field (DF) mode. The elemental composition along the cross-section has been studied by Scanning-Transmission electron microscopy (STEM) EDX, using high angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector. TEM analysis has been carried out through Velox software from ThermoFisher\xae. The cross-sectional TEM samples were prepared by lift-off method in a focused ion beam (FIB) dual beam SEM microscope from Tescan, using platinum as protective layer to prepare the lamella. Finally, the piezoelectric properties have been studied by measuring the d 33 coefficient through a Berlincourt method (PM-300 from Piezotest Ltd) adapted for thin film characterization.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
shows the half-normal probability plot obtained from the influence of KIV (i.e., magnetron power, Ar gas flow, and N2 gas flow) and the interaction between them, on the deposition rate (referred in DoE as key output variable, KOV) of the AlN thin films obtained from the profilometry measurements (see ). This plot compares the absolute value of the effect from each KIV (circles in ) and their interactions (squares in ), on the probability scale (see Section B of for further discussion about the half normal plot). For a given factor, the absolute effect is the difference of the average response variable over high factor levels X\u0305(+) minus the average response over the low factor levels X\u0305(\u2212). The absolute effect is calculated by Where X\u0305(+) and X\u0305(\u2212) are high and low factor levels, respectively. If the points are above the line will often indicate a positive effect, which means higher values of the corresponding KIV will contribute positive to KOVs. Here, the DoE demonstrates that both magnetron power and Ar flow are the KIV that most affect the growth rate of the AlN, as are the points that deviate from the line-orange line in. Moreover, power is the only parameter above the alpha level in the half normal scores (0.05). Moreover, AlN tensile stress and stoichiometry is influenced by the deposition rate. (a-g) shows the SEM-EDX spectrum obtained at the surface of samples. For samples #S1, #S2 and #S3, the main peaks correspond to Al and N atoms. On the other hand, samples S4-S8 have a higher intensity of the oxygen peak. (h) shows the N/Al ratio (left axis), obtained through the atomic percentage of nitrogen (N) divided by the atomic percentage of aluminum (Al), and the atomic percentage of oxygen (O) on the right axis. In this regard, samples S1 (4.98 nm/min), S2 (8.70 nm/min) and S3 (5.28 nm/min) exhibit N/Al ratio of around 1, which corresponds to highly stoichiometric crystals (see green dashed line in (h)). On the other hand, samples S4 (2.34 nm/min), S6 (1.02 nm/min) and S8 (0.84 nm/min) show a higher percentage of oxygen in the film structure leading to a stoichiometry highly differing from the ideal 1:1. Sample S7 shows a N:Al stoichiometry closer to 1:1, however the presence of oxygen is quite high, around 25 %. Samples deposited at lower powers have more porosity as a consequence of lower energy of ions and a lower density of ions, which enhance the post-oxidation effects in porous layers. shows the XRD spectra of samples. Samples S1, S2 and S3 are the only ones among all samples exhibiting diffraction peaks corresponding to a crystalline phase of AlN. Diffractograms S4-S8 do not show any diffraction peak. Regarding S1, S2 and S3, the major diffraction peak is observed around 2\u03b8 = 36.06\xb0 corresponds to (002) plane, characteristic of the wurtzite structure of AlN (extracted from Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) n\xba 54697 ). Sample S1 shows (002) peak centered at that 2\u03b8 = 36.00\xb0, whereas both #S2 and #S3 present (002) diffraction peak located at slightly lower angle (35.98\xb0), indicating an increase of the tensile stress on the film. Furthermore, (002) peak is wider in #S2 and #S3 than in #S1, which means a smaller crystallite size in #S2 and #S3. The FWHM of (002) peak shows low values on these samples, being 0.28, 0.43 and 0.32 for S1, S2 and S3 respectively. In a first order approximation, a reduction of the FWHM indicates larger grain size. Although samples have different thickness, a relative comparison of the FWHM indicates that sample S1 is the one showing bigger grains as it has a higher FWHM than S2 and S3. In terms of relative intensities, S1, S2 and S3 samples present 100 % for (002) orientation. Moreover, minimal diffraction signals are detected, mainly in samples #S2 and #S3, corresponding to AlN (100), at 2\u03b8 = 33.204\xb0and to AlN (101) at 2\u03b8 = 37.734\xb0. Sample S2 shows a relative intensity of 17 % for (100) and 7 % for (101), while S3 shows 50 % for (100) and 31 % for (101). These relative intensities deviate from the reference values that are 100 % for (100), 65 % for (002) and 86 % for (101). Additionally, samples #S2 and #S3 have shoulders in the (002) peak, which can be a consequence of crystal strain or heterogeneous grain size in the layer. Consequently, XRD confirms the crystallinity of these 3 samples. To sum up, samples #S1, #S2 and #S3, which are the samples that have more nitrogen incorporated and were deposited at higher deposition speeds, show the peak corresponding to the c-axis, (002) direction. This direction is where the polarization vector is stronger and it is related to the d 33 piezoelectric coefficient, which is the largest among all the d ij. shows TEM micrographs in BF mode of the sputtered AlN thin films with high stoichiometry and low oxygen content, i.e., those deposited under of #S1, #S2 and #S3 conditions (see ). Specifically, (a-c) present HRTEM micrographs of the AlN films and (d-f) their corresponding fast-Fourier transform (FFT). (a-c) show Moir\xe9 fringes, resulting from the interference of two sets of planes. By measuring in the FFT pattern the distance between the main spots and its symmetrical, the interplanar distance is calculated. From these measurements, the deduced interplanar distances are 0.27, 0.25 and 0.24 nm which corresponds to the (100), (002) and (101) families, respectively. Moreover, it is possible to do an approach of the grain size by comparing the FFT patterns. (d) shows a ring pattern with more defined spots than (e) and (f), where the patterns are well defined Debye-Scherrer rings. This indicates that #S1 presents wider grains than #S2 and #S3. This result is in agreement with those obtained in XRD, where S1 was the sample with lower FWHM, which indicates a bigger grain size. h shows the FFT of the grains of g. In this area, a pattern corresponding to the [010] pole is identified (i). Therefore, the TEM lamella is parallel to the (010) planes of a family of grains. These grains have their c-axis (direction [001]) perpendicular to the AlN/Si interface. Specifically, the presence of (002) orientation is crucial, as this orientation is the main responsible of the piezoelectric properties of the film. shows Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED), DF-TEM micrographs of samples (a) #S1, (#b) #S2 and (c) #S3 recorded using the [002], [100] and [101] reflections. SAED technique selects just a certain area of the sample by inserting an aperture (10 \xb5m) above the specimen. The main observed rings correspond to the family of plains (002), (100) and (101). The blue circumference marks the position of the objective aperture used for the DF micrograph. In these cases, the objective aperture is centered in the (002) spot. However, the smallest objective aperture available (10 \xb5m) is too big to select just the contribution of a single spot from the diffraction pattern, so the selected point covers the contributions of spots belonging to three different rings: (002), (100) and (101). Most of the grains that are illuminated have (002) orientation as the aperture is centered in that spot. Additionally, sample #S3 shows slightly tilted grains, 15\xba respect the c-axis, measured by ImageJ software. This is explained in terms of the different deposition conditions compared to samples #S1 and #S2. #S3 has been deposited at a higher pressure (4.15\xb710E^{\u22123} mbar) than #S1 and #S2 (3.4\xb710E^{\u22123} and 3.33\xb710E^{\u22123} mbar, respectively), as its total gas flow is 80 sccm, compared to the 60 sccm of total gas flow of #S1 and #S2. These phenomena will enhance the growth of (100) direction, instead of the c-axis direction (002), as the Al-N bond in the direction of the c-axis is higher. These results agree with XRD results, as the diffractogram #S3 shows a diffraction peak at 2\u03b8= 33.204, that corresponds to (100) orientation. (a) is a HRTEM micrograph of sample #S1 in cross-sectional view, showing the AlN/Si interface. Three sections are distinguished in this micrograph: AlN polycrystalline phase on the top (Zoom 1), an amorphous phase as interlayer (Zoom 2), and Si (100) substrate (Zoom 3). Each zoom has its corresponding FFT, comprising Zoom1-FFT1, Zoom2-FFT2, and Zoom 3-FFT3 presented in (e,d,f), respectively. FFT2-which is the FFT of the Zoom 2- shows less spots than FFT1 and contributions of an amorphous phase, as it shows amorphous circles, different from the polycrystalline rings observed in FFT1. On the other hand, regarding the grain size, Cutout 1, and Cutout 2 of show areas, pointed out with a dashed circumference, where grains of the indicated size are revealed. The deposited film has been divided in two sections for this purpose (Cutout 1 in (b), and Cutout 2 in (c)) as there is a clear difference between the grain size of the very first nanometers (\u223c10nm) of the deposited film and the grain size of the rest of it. The section of Cutout 1 shows larger grains (> 5 nm) than the grains observed in Cutout 2 (<5 nm). These results agree with those of FFT, as FFT1 shows more distinguished spots than FFT2, which indicates a larger grain size. Additionally, EDX through STEM has been carried out to study the elemental composition along the layer of sample #S1 ((g) STEM micrograph using HAADF detector). The section corresponding to Zoom2 in (e) shows a composition of a higher concentration of oxygen than nitrogen, being the opposite composition of Zoom1 ((d)), that presents a higher concentration of nitrogen than oxygen. This HRTEM micrograph indicates that the interlayer of sample #S1 observed in (c) (Cutout 2) corresponds to small grains of AlN (<5 nm) in a matrix of an amorphous phase of AlxNyOz. The native oxygen on Si (100) along with the residual oxygen in the reaction chamber and the low deposition temperature have produced this interlayer, as is reported by Hwang et al.. (a) presents d 33 coefficient measured in AlN thin films with different stoichiometries, i.e., N/Al ratios (see EDX analysis above). From that study, one could easily understand that samples with a better stoichiometry, i.e., samples with a N/Al ratio closer to 1 (S1, S2 and S3), are those AlN thin films exhibiting a higher d 33 coefficient of around 4.5\u20135 pC/N. These results are in good agreement with those of the XRD and TEM, as the samples that present a higher d 33 coefficient match with the ones that show good (002) orientation. A c-axis (002) orientation of the hexagonal AlN is necessary for enhance the d 33 coefficient of the material. Furthermore, as reported by Fei et al., the piezoelectric stress constant is significantly influenced by the c-axis and the (002) orientation distribution. Additionally, the slightly titling angle observed in sample S3 ((c)) may have reduced the d 33 coefficient, i.e., the effective d 33 is reduced by a factor cos \u03b3, where \u03b3 is the angle of the c-axis with respect to the substrate normal (see (c)). The mixture of grains and their size observed in HRTEM micrographs might contribute to reduce the d 33 due to the inversion of domains as it creates dipoles in opposite directions. The DoE demonstrates that magnetron power combined with the nitrogen flow is the factor interaction that affects the most the d 33 of the film, as is the factor interaction with a higher absolute effect and deviates more above the line within the power. However, these points do not affect significantly to the d 33 as they do not deviate drastically from the line.

This HRTEM micrograph indicates that the interlayer of sample #S1 observed in (c) (Cutout 2) corresponds to small grains of AlN (<5 nm) in a matrix of an amorphous phase of AlxNyOz. The native oxygen on Si (100) along with the residual oxygen in the reaction chamber and the low deposition temperature have produced this interlayer, as is reported by Hwang et al.. (a) presents d 33 coefficient measured in AlN thin films with different stoichiometries, i.e., N/Al ratios (see EDX analysis above). From that study, one could easily understand that samples with a better stoichiometry, i.e., samples with a N/Al ratio closer to 1 (S1, S2 and S3), are those AlN thin films exhibiting a higher d 33 coefficient of around 4.5\u20135 pC/N. These results are in good agreement with those of the XRD and TEM, as the samples that present a higher d 33 coefficient match with the ones that show good (002) orientation. A c-axis (002) orientation of the hexagonal AlN is necessary for enhance the d 33 coefficient of the material. Furthermore, as reported by Fei et al., the piezoelectric stress constant is significantly influenced by the c-axis and the (002) orientation distribution. Additionally, the slightly titling angle observed in sample S3 ((c)) may have reduced the d 33 coefficient, i.e., the effective d 33 is reduced by a factor cos \u03b3, where \u03b3 is the angle of the c-axis with respect to the substrate normal (see (c)). The mixture of grains and their size observed in HRTEM micrographs might contribute to reduce the d 33 due to the inversion of domains as it creates dipoles in opposite directions. The DoE demonstrates that magnetron power combined with the nitrogen flow is the factor interaction that affects the most the d 33 of the film, as is the factor interaction with a higher absolute effect and deviates more above the line within the power. However, these points do not affect significantly to the d 33 as they do not deviate drastically from the line.

AlN thin films were deposited by DC reactive magnetron sputtering (Nordiko Ltd, UK) from a 100 \xd7 300 mmE^{2} Al target (99.99 % purity) using N2 and Ar as process gases. The layers were deposited on 0.80-inch single side polished (100)-oriented Si substrates (from University Wafer\xae). Prior to each deposition, substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic cleaning system (UCS, from Optimal Technologies\xae) consisting in a series of ultrasonic baths, comprising: (i) 5 minutes in Decon neutracon\xae solvent (anionic and non-ionic active surface agents in an aqueous polyhydric alcohol base); (ii) 5 minutes in WashBryte\xae solvent: 15\u201330 % anionic surfactants; (iii) 5 minutes in deionized (DI) water. Finally, substrates were dried under N2 flow and loaded into the deposition system under a residual pressure around 10E^{\u22127} mbar, to prevent air contamination. Prior to each deposition, and with the shutter covering the substrate set in close position, the Al target was cleaned in pure Ar (flow of 30 sccm) at 300 W for 10 min to remove potential oxygen contamination from the surface, followed by 5 min carried out in a reactive atmosphere (i.e., Ar/N2 plasma) to reach stable reactive conditions of the plasma, the latter similar to that used during the depositions. The deposition series have been planned via DoE through R-code software (R 4.2.1 version, from Bell Laboratories Inc.) , using magnetron power, N2 gas flow, and Ar gas flow as key input variables (KIV). In this work, DoE approach involving the utilization of an upper and lower limit of each growth parameter i.e., 2-levels study was used, that corresponds therefore to a linear modelling. Specifically, AlN thin films were deposited using magnetron powers of 70 and 400 W, and Ar & N2 flows of 20 and 40 sccm limits as summarized in. Sample S5 has not been carried out since plasma was not stable under those conditions. The thicknesses of the deposited layers, and hence the deposition rate , were obtained by profilometry (Dektak 3ST surface profilometer from Veeco\xae). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) have been carried out in a VEGA 4 from Tescan to study the film morphology and the elemental composition, respectively, operating at 5 keV and 300 pA. The film crystallinity has been studied by XRD using a Siemens D5000 X-Ray diffractometer (Cu K\u03b1, 1.5406 \xc5) at 40 kV/30 mA. The measures were performed in the thin films, in symmetric diffraction geometry, collecting Bragg reflections with a 2D detector. The XRD analysis has been carried out using PANalytical X\u2019Pert HighScore Plus software. In addition, TEM studies have been carried out in a FEI Talos F200X microscope, operating at 200 keV and working in bright field (BF) and dark field (DF) mode. The elemental composition along the cross-section has been studied by Scanning-Transmission electron microscopy (STEM) EDX, using high angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector. TEM analysis has been carried out through Velox software from ThermoFisher\xae. The cross-sectional TEM samples were prepared by lift-off method in a focused ion beam (FIB) dual beam SEM microscope from Tescan, using platinum as protective layer to prepare the lamella. Finally, the piezoelectric properties have been studied by measuring the d 33 coefficient through a Berlincourt method (PM-300 from Piezotest Ltd) adapted for thin film characterization.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
shows the half-normal probability plot obtained from the influence of KIV (i.e., magnetron power, Ar gas flow, and N2 gas flow) and the interaction between them, on the deposition rate (referred in DoE as key output variable, KOV) of the AlN thin films obtained from the profilometry measurements (see ). This plot compares the absolute value of the effect from each KIV (circles in ) and their interactions (squares in ), on the probability scale (see Section B of for further discussion about the half normal plot). For a given factor, the absolute effect is the difference of the average response variable over high factor levels X\u0305(+) minus the average response over the low factor levels X\u0305(\u2212). The absolute effect is calculated by Where X\u0305(+) and X\u0305(\u2212) are high and low factor levels, respectively. If the points are above the line will often indicate a positive effect, which means higher values of the corresponding KIV will contribute positive to KOVs. Here, the DoE demonstrates that both magnetron power and Ar flow are the KIV that most affect the growth rate of the AlN, as are the points that deviate from the line-orange line in. Moreover, power is the only parameter above the alpha level in the half normal scores (0.05). Moreover, AlN tensile stress and stoichiometry is influenced by the deposition rate. (a-g) shows the SEM-EDX spectrum obtained at the surface of samples. For samples #S1, #S2 and #S3, the main peaks correspond to Al and N atoms. On the other hand, samples S4-S8 have a higher intensity of the oxygen peak. (h) shows the N/Al ratio (left axis), obtained through the atomic percentage of nitrogen (N) divided by the atomic percentage of aluminum (Al), and the atomic percentage of oxygen (O) on the right axis. In this regard, samples S1 (4.98 nm/min), S2 (8.70 nm/min) and S3 (5.28 nm/min) exhibit N/Al ratio of around 1, which corresponds to highly stoichiometric crystals (see green dashed line in (h)). On the other hand, samples S4 (2.34 nm/min), S6 (1.02 nm/min) and S8 (0.84 nm/min) show a higher percentage of oxygen in the film structure leading to a stoichiometry highly differing from the ideal 1:1. Sample S7 shows a N:Al stoichiometry closer to 1:1, however the presence of oxygen is quite high, around 25 %. Samples deposited at lower powers have more porosity as a consequence of lower energy of ions and a lower density of ions, which enhance the post-oxidation effects in porous layers. shows the XRD spectra of samples. Samples S1, S2 and S3 are the only ones among all samples exhibiting diffraction peaks corresponding to a crystalline phase of AlN. Diffractograms S4-S8 do not show any diffraction peak. Regarding S1, S2 and S3, the major diffraction peak is observed around 2\u03b8 = 36.06\xb0 corresponds to (002) plane, characteristic of the wurtzite structure of AlN (extracted from Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) n\xba 54697 ). Sample S1 shows (002) peak centered at that 2\u03b8 = 36.00\xb0, whereas both #S2 and #S3 present (002) diffraction peak located at slightly lower angle (35.98\xb0), indicating an increase of the tensile stress on the film. Furthermore, (002) peak is wider in #S2 and #S3 than in #S1, which means a smaller crystallite size in #S2 and #S3. The FWHM of (002) peak shows low values on these samples, being 0.28, 0.43 and 0.32 for S1, S2 and S3 respectively. In a first order approximation, a reduction of the FWHM indicates larger grain size. Although samples have different thickness, a relative comparison of the FWHM indicates that sample S1 is the one showing bigger grains as it has a higher FWHM than S2 and S3. In terms of relative intensities, S1, S2 and S3 samples present 100 % for (002) orientation. Moreover, minimal diffraction signals are detected, mainly in samples #S2 and #S3, corresponding to AlN (100), at 2\u03b8 = 33.204\xb0and to AlN (101) at 2\u03b8 = 37.734\xb0. Sample S2 shows a relative intensity of 17 % for (100) and 7 % for (101), while S3 shows 50 % for (100) and 31 % for (101). These relative intensities deviate from the reference values that are 100 % for (100), 65 % for (002) and 86 % for (101). Additionally, samples #S2 and #S3 have shoulders in the (002) peak, which can be a consequence of crystal strain or heterogeneous grain size in the layer. Consequently, XRD confirms the crystallinity of these 3 samples. To sum up, samples #S1, #S2 and #S3, which are the samples that have more nitrogen incorporated and were deposited at higher deposition speeds, show the peak corresponding to the c-axis, (002) direction. This direction is where the polarization vector is stronger and it is related to the d 33 piezoelectric coefficient, which is the largest among all the d ij. shows TEM micrographs in BF mode of the sputtered AlN thin films with high stoichiometry and low oxygen content, i.e., those deposited under of #S1, #S2 and #S3 conditions (see ). Specifically, (a-c) present HRTEM micrographs of the AlN films and (d-f) their corresponding fast-Fourier transform (FFT). (a-c) show Moir\xe9 fringes, resulting from the interference of two sets of planes. By measuring in the FFT pattern the distance between the main spots and its symmetrical, the interplanar distance is calculated. From these measurements, the deduced interplanar distances are 0.27, 0.25 and 0.24 nm which corresponds to the (100), (002) and (101) families, respectively. Moreover, it is possible to do an approach of the grain size by comparing the FFT patterns. (d) shows a ring pattern with more defined spots than (e) and (f), where the patterns are well defined Debye-Scherrer rings. This indicates that #S1 presents wider grains than #S2 and #S3. This result is in agreement with those obtained in XRD, where S1 was the sample with lower FWHM, which indicates a bigger grain size. h shows the FFT of the grains of g. In this area, a pattern corresponding to the [010] pole is identified (i). Therefore, the TEM lamella is parallel to the (010) planes of a family of grains. These grains have their c-axis (direction [001]) perpendicular to the AlN/Si interface. Specifically, the presence of (002) orientation is crucial, as this orientation is the main responsible of the piezoelectric properties of the film. shows Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED), DF-TEM micrographs of samples (a) #S1, (#b) #S2 and (c) #S3 recorded using the [002], [100] and [101] reflections. SAED technique selects just a certain area of the sample by inserting an aperture (10 \xb5m) above the specimen. The main observed rings correspond to the family of plains (002), (100) and (101). The blue circumference marks the position of the objective aperture used for the DF micrograph. In these cases, the objective aperture is centered in the (002) spot. However, the smallest objective aperture available (10 \xb5m) is too big to select just the contribution of a single spot from the diffraction pattern, so the selected point covers the contributions of spots belonging to three different rings: (002), (100) and (101). Most of the grains that are illuminated have (002) orientation as the aperture is centered in that spot. Additionally, sample #S3 shows slightly tilted grains, 15\xba respect the c-axis, measured by ImageJ software. This is explained in terms of the different deposition conditions compared to samples #S1 and #S2. #S3 has been deposited at a higher pressure (4.15\xb710E^{\u22123} mbar) than #S1 and #S2 (3.4\xb710E^{\u22123} and 3.33\xb710E^{\u22123} mbar, respectively), as its total gas flow is 80 sccm, compared to the 60 sccm of total gas flow of #S1 and #S2. These phenomena will enhance the growth of (100) direction, instead of the c-axis direction (002), as the Al-N bond in the direction of the c-axis is higher. These results agree with XRD results, as the diffractogram #S3 shows a diffraction peak at 2\u03b8= 33.204, that corresponds to (100) orientation. (a) is a HRTEM micrograph of sample #S1 in cross-sectional view, showing the AlN/Si interface. Three sections are distinguished in this micrograph: AlN polycrystalline phase on the top (Zoom 1), an amorphous phase as interlayer (Zoom 2), and Si (100) substrate (Zoom 3). Each zoom has its corresponding FFT, comprising Zoom1-FFT1, Zoom2-FFT2, and Zoom 3-FFT3 presented in (e,d,f), respectively. FFT2-which is the FFT of the Zoom 2- shows less spots than FFT1 and contributions of an amorphous phase, as it shows amorphous circles, different from the polycrystalline rings observed in FFT1. On the other hand, regarding the grain size, Cutout 1, and Cutout 2 of show areas, pointed out with a dashed circumference, where grains of the indicated size are revealed. The deposited film has been divided in two sections for this purpose (Cutout 1 in (b), and Cutout 2 in (c)) as there is a clear difference between the grain size of the very first nanometers (\u223c10nm) of the deposited film and the grain size of the rest of it. The section of Cutout 1 shows larger grains (> 5 nm) than the grains observed in Cutout 2 (<5 nm). These results agree with those of FFT, as FFT1 shows more distinguished spots than FFT2, which indicates a larger grain size. Additionally, EDX through STEM has been carried out to study the elemental composition along the layer of sample #S1 ((g) STEM micrograph using HAADF detector). The section corresponding to Zoom2 in (e) shows a composition of a higher concentration of oxygen than nitrogen, being the opposite composition of Zoom1 ((d)), that presents a higher concentration of nitrogen than oxygen. This HRTEM micrograph indicates that the interlayer of sample #S1 observed in (c) (Cutout 2) corresponds to small grains of AlN (<5 nm) in a matrix of an amorphous phase of AlxNyOz. The native oxygen on Si (100) along with the residual oxygen in the reaction chamber and the low deposition temperature have produced this interlayer, as is reported by Hwang et al.. (a) presents d 33 coefficient measured in AlN thin films with different stoichiometries, i.e., N/Al ratios (see EDX analysis above). From that study, one could easily understand that samples with a better stoichiometry, i.e., samples with a N/Al ratio closer to 1 (S1, S2 and S3), are those AlN thin films exhibiting a higher d 33 coefficient of around 4.5\u20135 pC/N. These results are in good agreement with those of the XRD and TEM, as the samples that present a higher d 33 coefficient match with the ones that show good (002) orientation. A c-axis (002) orientation of the hexagonal AlN is necessary for enhance the d 33 coefficient of the material. Furthermore, as reported by Fei et al., the piezoelectric stress constant is significantly influenced by the c-axis and the (002) orientation distribution. Additionally, the slightly titling angle observed in sample S3 ((c)) may have reduced the d 33 coefficient, i.e., the effective d 33 is reduced by a factor cos \u03b3, where \u03b3 is the angle of the c-axis with respect to the substrate normal (see (c)). The mixture of grains and their size observed in HRTEM micrographs might contribute to reduce the d 33 due to the inversion of domains as it creates dipoles in opposite directions. The DoE demonstrates that magnetron power combined with the nitrogen flow is the factor interaction that affects the most the d 33 of the film, as is the factor interaction with a higher absolute effect and deviates more above the line within the power. However, these points do not affect significantly to the d 33 as they do not deviate drastically from the line.

This plot compares the absolute value of the effect from each KIV (circles in ) and their interactions (squares in ), on the probability scale (see Section B of for further discussion about the half normal plot). For a given factor, the absolute effect is the difference of the average response variable over high factor levels X\u0305(+) minus the average response over the low factor levels X\u0305(\u2212).

In this area, a pattern corresponding to the [010] pole is identified (i). Therefore, the TEM lamella is parallel to the (010) planes of a family of grains. These grains have their c-axis (direction [001]) perpendicular to the AlN/Si interface. Specifically, the presence of (002) orientation is crucial, as this orientation is the main responsible of the piezoelectric properties of the film. shows Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED), DF-TEM micrographs of samples (a) #S1, (#b) #S2 and (c) #S3 recorded using the [002], [100] and [101] reflections. SAED technique selects just a certain area of the sample by inserting an aperture (10 \xb5m) above the specimen. The main observed rings correspond to the family of plains (002), (100) and (101). The blue circumference marks the position of the objective aperture used for the DF micrograph. In these cases, the objective aperture is centered in the (002) spot. However, the smallest objective aperture available (10 \xb5m) is too big to select just the contribution of a single spot from the diffraction pattern, so the selected point covers the contributions of spots belonging to three different rings: (002), (100) and (101). Most of the grains that are illuminated have (002) orientation as the aperture is centered in that spot. Additionally, sample #S3 shows slightly tilted grains, 15\xba respect the c-axis, measured by ImageJ software. This is explained in terms of the different deposition conditions compared to samples #S1 and #S2. #S3 has been deposited at a higher pressure (4.15\xb710E^{\u22123} mbar) than #S1 and #S2 (3.4\xb710E^{\u22123} and 3.33\xb710E^{\u22123} mbar, respectively), as its total gas flow is 80 sccm, compared to the 60 sccm of total gas flow of #S1 and #S2. These phenomena will enhance the growth of (100) direction, instead of the c-axis direction (002), as the Al-N bond in the direction of the c-axis is higher. These results agree with XRD results, as the diffractogram #S3 shows a diffraction peak at 2\u03b8= 33.204, that corresponds to (100) orientation. (a) is a HRTEM micrograph of sample #S1 in cross-sectional view, showing the AlN/Si interface. Three sections are distinguished in this micrograph: AlN polycrystalline phase on the top (Zoom 1), an amorphous phase as interlayer (Zoom 2), and Si (100) substrate (Zoom 3). Each zoom has its corresponding FFT, comprising Zoom1-FFT1, Zoom2-FFT2, and Zoom 3-FFT3 presented in (e,d,f), respectively. FFT2-which is the FFT of the Zoom 2- shows less spots than FFT1 and contributions of an amorphous phase, as it shows amorphous circles, different from the polycrystalline rings observed in FFT1. On the other hand, regarding the grain size, Cutout 1, and Cutout 2 of show areas, pointed out with a dashed circumference, where grains of the indicated size are revealed. The deposited film has been divided in two sections for this purpose (Cutout 1 in (b), and Cutout 2 in (c)) as there is a clear difference between the grain size of the very first nanometers (\u223c10nm) of the deposited film and the grain size of the rest of it. The section of Cutout 1 shows larger grains (> 5 nm) than the grains observed in Cutout 2 (<5 nm). These results agree with those of FFT, as FFT1 shows more distinguished spots than FFT2, which indicates a larger grain size. Additionally, EDX through STEM has been carried out to study the elemental composition along the layer of sample #S1 ((g) STEM micrograph using HAADF detector). The section corresponding to Zoom2 in (e) shows a composition of a higher concentration of oxygen than nitrogen, being the opposite composition of Zoom1 ((d)), that presents a higher concentration of nitrogen than oxygen. This HRTEM micrograph indicates that the interlayer of sample #S1 observed in (c) (Cutout 2) corresponds to small grains of AlN (<5 nm) in a matrix of an amorphous phase of AlxNyOz. The native oxygen on Si (100) along with the residual oxygen in the reaction chamber and the low deposition temperature have produced this interlayer, as is reported by Hwang et al.. (a) presents d 33 coefficient measured in AlN thin films with different stoichiometries, i.e., N/Al ratios (see EDX analysis above). From that study, one could easily understand that samples with a better stoichiometry, i.e., samples with a N/Al ratio closer to 1 (S1, S2 and S3), are those AlN thin films exhibiting a higher d 33 coefficient of around 4.5\u20135 pC/N. These results are in good agreement with those of the XRD and TEM, as the samples that present a higher d 33 coefficient match with the ones that show good (002) orientation. A c-axis (002) orientation of the hexagonal AlN is necessary for enhance the d 33 coefficient of the material. Furthermore, as reported by Fei et al., the piezoelectric stress constant is significantly influenced by the c-axis and the (002) orientation distribution. Additionally, the slightly titling angle observed in sample S3 ((c)) may have reduced the d 33 coefficient, i.e., the effective d 33 is reduced by a factor cos \u03b3, where \u03b3 is the angle of the c-axis with respect to the substrate normal (see (c)). The mixture of grains and their size observed in HRTEM micrographs might contribute to reduce the d 33 due to the inversion of domains as it creates dipoles in opposite directions. The DoE demonstrates that magnetron power combined with the nitrogen flow is the factor interaction that affects the most the d 33 of the film, as is the factor interaction with a higher absolute effect and deviates more above the line within the power. However, these points do not affect significantly to the d 33 as they do not deviate drastically from the line.
