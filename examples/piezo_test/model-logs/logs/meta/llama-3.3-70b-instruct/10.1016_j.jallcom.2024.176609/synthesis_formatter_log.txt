Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'conventional solid-state reaction', 'precursors': ['PbO', 'ZrO2', 'NiO', 'Ta2O5', 'TiO2', 'MnO2'], 'steps': ['Raw materials were accurately weighed according to the stoichiometric ratio', 'Milling in alcohol with zirconia balls for a duration of 12 hours', 'Dried and presintered at a temperature of 750 °C for a period of 2 hours', 'Calcined powder underwent an additional ball-milling process lasting 24 hours', 'Mixed with 7 wt% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and compressed into gray disks measuring 13 mm in diameter', 'Sintered at the temperatures ranging from 1180 to 1270 °C in air for 3 hours'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'SEM', 'LCR test instrument', 'Quasi-static meter', 'Ferroelectric test system', 'Precision Impedance Analyzer']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
