The 0.74 Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.26PbTiO3 (PMN-0.26 PT) single crystals were grown by a modified Bridgeman method. The as-grown single crystals were oriented by the rotating XRD method , and the [001]-oriented square slices were cut with size 4 \xd7 4 \xd7 0.8 mmE^{3}. In order to enhance the binding force between the single crystal and electrode, a layer of Ni was covered on the (001) plane crystal slices, and then, the Au electrode was sputtered on the crystal slices for poling and subsequently electrical performance measurement. All samples were annealed at 600 \xb0C for 10 h and then air-cooled to room temperature. Meanwhile, the samples were placed at room temperature for 2 days to completely release the internal stress. Temperature dependence of dielectric properties of the [001]-oriented PMN-0.26 PT single crystals were measured by an Agilent 4294A impedance analyzer. Polarization-electric field (P-E) and strain-electric field (S-E) hysteresis loops were measured by a TF analyzer 1000 (aix ACCT) at different temperatures (25 \xb0C, 40 \xb0C, 60 \xb0C, 70 \xb0C, 80 \xb0C, 90 \xb0C, 100 \xb0C, 120 \xb0C, 130 \xb0C, and 150 \xb0C). During the DCP procedure, samples were poled at different electric field with dwelling 5 min at 25 \xb0C so that the single crystals could be poled completely. For the ACP procedure, the ACP signal was generated by a Function Generator (Agilent 33320A) and amplified by a high-voltage amplifier (Trek Model 10/40A) to adjust the alternating current poling conditions. Furthermore, the change of voltage can be monitored by the oscilloscope (Keysight, DSOX2014A). a shows the experimental setup for ACP poling process. The symmetry triangular wave was chosen to study the influence of other poling conditions on performance during the ACP procedure. Considering the aging effect of the materials, the electrical performance was measured 24 h after poling. After poling, d33 was measured by a ZJ-4AN d33 m. The electromechanical coupling coefficient (kt) was recorded by an Agilent 4294A impedance analyzer using impedance resonance method, and kt was calculated by following equation : where f r and f a were the resonance and antiresonance frequency, respectively. The free dielectric constant \u03b533/\u03b50 was written as the follows : where C E^{ } was the capacitance of single crystal measured at frequency 1 kHz, S and t represented the area and thickness of the sample with (001) plane, respectively, and \u03b50 was the vacuum permittivity, 8.8542 \xd7 10E^{\u221212} F/m. The converse piezoelectric coefficient d33\u2217 was determined based on the S-E hysteresis loop and was calculated by the equation : where \u201cS\u201d represented the strain responded to the applied external electric filed \u201cE\u201d. The phase structure of PMN-0.26 PT single crystal before poling and poled by different procedure was measured by X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D2 phaser, Bruker, Germany). The domain pattern of PMN-0.26 PT single crystal poled by both the ACP and DCP methods after aging was observed by piezoresponse force microscope (PFM, MFP-3D, Asylum Research, USA).

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
For the ACP process, b shows the impact of loading cycles (N) on d33 and longitudinal mode \u03b5E^{T} 33/\u03b50 when the frequency is 0.1 Hz and the poling electric field maintains 14 kV/cm. It can be seen that the loading cycles N of the ACP (0.1 Hz) procedure exert a notable impact on d33 and \u03b5E^{T} 33/\u03b50. With the increase of N, the d33 value rises first and then falls down, and the maximum d33 value appears in 5 loading cycles, reaching 1780 pC/N. The change trend of \u03b5E^{T} 33/\u03b50 value keeps pace with the fluctuation of d33. The d33 and \u03b5E^{T} 33/\u03b50 values for the [001]-oriented PMN-0.26 PT single crystal exhibit a downward trend when N exceeds 5, showing that appropriate loading cycles are in favor of achieving the best poling effect. Furthermore, when the N value exceeds 5, too much crack may be generated due to too much poling time, which will deteriorate electrical performance. compares the d33 and kt difference for the PMN-0.26 PT single crystal during both the DCP and ACP procedure with different external electric fields. The d33 and kt versus electric field curves have similar variation trend for both the DCP and ACP samples, whereas the maximum values of d33 and kt appear at different external electric field. During the DCP procedure, the d33 value reaches maximum value 1250 pC/N at poling electric field 12 kV/cm, and then decreases slightly. During the ACP process, the d33 value increases further and reaches the maximum d33 value 1780 pC/N at poling electric field 14 kV/cm, which shows close to 42.4 % enhancement in contrast to the DCP sample. As shown in b, when the electric field is elevated from 2 kV/cm to 8 kV/cm, the kt value of DCP sample increases from 0.32 to 0.52, whereas the kt value of ACP sample increases from 0.35 to 0.51. However, as the electric field continues to ascend, the kt value of ACP sample reaches the maximum value 0.58 at poling electric field 14 kV/cm, and then exhibits an obviously decline trend till 20 kV/cm, whereas the DCP sample keeps stable kt value at around 0.51. Therefore, the optimum condition for the low frequency (0.1 Hz) ACP procedure is obtained under electric field 14 kV/cm with 5 cycles. According to the phase diagram of pseudo-binary PMN-xPT ferroelectric single crystal, the unpoled PMN-0.26 PT single crystal (NOP) is away from the MPB region and presents rhombohedral (R) phase at room temperature. shows the temperature dependence of \u03b5E^{T} 33/\u03b50 of the PMN-0.26 PT single crystal before poling and after poling. For the following experiment, the ACP conditions are maintained at 0.1 Hz, 14 kV/cm, and 5 loading cycles. After poling, both the DCP and ACP samples undergo a successive three-phase ferroelectric phase transition during heating, i.e., rhombohedral ferroelectric phase-tetragonal ferroelectric phase-cubic paraelectric phase (R-T-C), showing that the applied electric field along the [001] orientation directly induces the tetragonal ferroelectric phase in the PMN-0.26 PT composition below the Curie temperature (TC). Such phenomenon is consistent with the high-resolution synchrotron diffraction result of the PMN-0.26 PT single crystal recently reported by Qiu et al., which verifies that no monoclinic phase exists in PMN-0.26 PT during the ACP process. Comparing with the DCP sample, the ACP sample has a higher dielectric constant 39800 and a sharper dielectric peak at around 99.7 \xb0C, which may be related to the formation of the polar nano regions (PNRs). Given the equation d33 = 2Q11\u03b533Ps , a larger piezoelectric response d33 can be anticipated in the ACP sample due to its larger dielectric constant. However, when the temperature is above TC, there is almost no difference between the DCP and ACP samples since they all present the high-temperature cubic paraelectric phase (C). provides the basic properties of this work and some relaxor-PbTiO3 ferroelectric single crystals. The ACP PMN-0.26 PT single crystal has a higher ferroelectric phase transition temperature 99.7 \xb0C as compared with some other pseudo-ternary relaxor-PbTiO3 ferroelectric single crystals, suggesting that the PMN-0.26 PT single crystal has better thermal stability. shows the P-E and S-E hysteresis loops of the ACP treated [001]-oriented PMN-0.26 PT single crystal at various temperatures measured at 10 Hz and E = 20 kV/cm, in which the electric field provides enough energy to overcome the energy barrier for the complete switching and reversal of domains. With the increase of temperature, the maximum polarization Pm and coercive field Ec decrease gradually, and the \u201csaturated hysteresis loop\u201d changes to a \u201cslim hysteresis loop\u201d suddenly at 150 \xb0C. By contrast with the P-E hysteresis loop, the change of bipolar S-E hysteresis loop with temperature of the ACP PMN-0.26 PT single crystal shows more intricated behavior. As presented in b, the S-E loop becomes broader, has larger strain and hysteresis, and exhibits obvious negative strain between 60 \xb0C and 90 \xb0C, correlating with the temperature induced R-T ferroelectric phase transition. Above 90 \xb0C, the positive strain tends to increase with further elevating temperature, mainly relating to the increased lattice expansion and easier switching of ferroelectric domains. As the temperature increases, the Ec value decreases slowly from 1.97 kV/cm at room temperature to 1.41 kV/cm at 80 \xb0C. Subsequently, an abnormal slight increase occurs at 100 \xb0C and the Ec value increases to 1.55 kV/cm, correlating with the R-T ferroelectric phase transition. Then, the Ec value decreases significantly and almost linearly to 0.56 kV/cm until 130 \xb0C, and becomes nearly stable of 0.54 kV/cm with further increasing temperature to 150 \xb0C. The change of maximum strain Smax is more obvious around the R-T phase transition temperature (TR-T), which increases greatly from 0.37 % at room temperature and varies around 0.46 % near TR-T (60\u201390 \xb0C), and then decreases sharply to 0.31 % at 100 \xb0C. With further increasing temperature, the Smax value varies slightly till 130 \xb0C (slightly higher than TC), and then decreases to 0.23 % at 150 \xb0C. At 27 \xb0C, there is no obvious strain hysteresis and strain presents nearly linear dependency on electric filed since the R phase is the dominant phase around room temperature and no phase transition is induced by electric field within 0\u201315 kV/cm. Among 40\u201390 \xb0C, the phase coexistence of R and T occurs. Taking the 90 \xb0C unipolar S-E curve as an example, it can be clearly divided into three sections. Significant nonlinear increase of strain accompanied by large hysteresis is caused by electric field within 1.85\u20132.40 kV/cm, generating gigantic converse piezoelectric coefficient d33\u2217 of 5635\u20136771 p.m./V, and relating to the R-T ferroelectric phase transition. With further elevating the external electric field, the content of T phase increases gradually, leading to the gradual decrease of d33\u2217 value (varying within 6768-4858 p.m./V between 2.41 and 6.21 kV/cm). Above 7.5 kV/cm, the strain hysteresis almost disappears, and the d33\u2217 value significantly decreases to 2458 p.m./V at 15 kV/cm, showing that the PMN-0.26 PT single crystal changes to the T phase completely. At 110 \xb0C, the ACP PMN-0.26 PT single crystal experiences the T-C phase transition at zero electric field, and the T phase still coexists with the C phase at low electric field. The Smax value severely reduces between 110 \xb0C and 150 \xb0C, which can be attributed to the contribution of PNRs with high symmetry in the cubic paraelectric matrix. At 180 \xb0C, the dominant phase is the C phase at the zero electric field. Above 2.5 kV/cm, rather large strain is induced and the strain presents nearly linear increase with elevating the external electric field. Similar change characteristic around the ferroelectric phase transition is also observed in the 0.75 Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.25PbTiO3 single crystals reported by Cao et al.. Albeit many scholars have studied the aging behavior of ferroelectric single crystals after DCP , similar research on the ACP treated sample is relatively lacking. The domain patterns of the PMN-0.26 PT single crystals poled by both the ACP and DCP methods after aging for 3 months are shown in studied by PFM. The domain configuration of the ACP sample is considerably different from that of the DCP sample in the observed 20 \xd7 20 \u03bcmE^{2} region. In the amplitude diagram shown in a and c, the ACP sample presents a series of periodic stripe-like domain structure with more regular lamellar and narrower width patterns as compared with the DCP sample. In the phase diagram shown in b and d, it can be seen that ferroelectric domains with different angles are induced in the ACP sample, in which the phase difference is very large, and the domain walls are relatively obvious. As comparison, the DCP sample presents a weaker image since the flipping direction of the electric dipoles tends to be consistent after the DCP poling. Such difference in domain configuration can be explained that during the ACP procedure the electric field is repeatedly applied reversal, which leads to the adjacent 71\xb0 domain walls to flip and eventually merge in the (001)-poled PMN-0.26 PT single crystal. The 71\xb0 domain walls are energetically easily align and reorientate under low-frequency AC electric field due to their lower energy barriers compared to other domain orientations. The enlargement of the 71\xb0 domain width reduces the polarization variation of the <111> polarization and flattens the free energy profile, thereby enhancing the piezoelectricity accordingly. As shown in a, there is no evident splitting of the (100) and (200) diffraction peaks for different PMN-0.26 PT single crystal samples (NOP, DCP, ACP), implying that these samples still present the rhombohedral phase. After poling, the relative XRD intensity of the diffraction peak increases greatly for the DCP and ACP samples as compared with that of the NOP sample. b shows expanded plots of the (100) and (200) diffraction peaks, and the corresponding full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the PMN-0.26 PT single crystal under different states. After poling, FWHM of the (100) and (200) diffraction peaks increases apparently, but has difference on poling methods. For the (100) diffraction peak, there is no apparent difference in terms of FWHM, being 0.216\xb0 and 0.217\xb0 for the DCP and ACP samples, respectively. FWHM of the (200) diffraction peak increases significantly and presents great difference under different poling methods, being 0.274\xb0, 0.510\xb0 and 0.428\xb0 for the NOP, DCP and ACP samples, respectively. Such increase of FWHM indicates that the ACP and DCP poling increase the domain size and decrease the homogeneity of domain structure. Compared with DCP, FWHM of (200) after ACP is 16.1 % smaller, indirectly revealing that the domain size is smaller and the domain structure is more homogeneous after ACP. In addition, the 2\u03b8 degree of both (100) and (200) diffraction peaks moves towards higher angles, being the DCP (22.21\xb0, 45.13\xb0) and ACP (22.17\xb0, 45.11\xb0) samples, respectively, compared with the NOP (22.11\xb0, 44.99\xb0) sample. In brief, the change of diffraction peaks reflects the total free energy variation of the PMN-0.26 PT single crystal under different states caused by poling. This difference also indicates that the crystal structure formed in the ACP sample has a lower energy barrier than that of the DCP sample, which is related to the presence of 71\xb0 domain structure. This conclusion is well consistent with the results of PFM characterization.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
For the ACP process, b shows the impact of loading cycles (N) on d33 and longitudinal mode \u03b5E^{T} 33/\u03b50 when the frequency is 0.1 Hz and the poling electric field maintains 14 kV/cm.

Therefore, the optimum condition for the low frequency (0.1 Hz) ACP procedure is obtained under electric field 14 kV/cm with 5 cycles.

With the increase of temperature, the maximum polarization Pm and coercive field Ec decrease gradually, and the \u201csaturated hysteresis loop\u201d changes to a \u201cslim hysteresis loop\u201d suddenly at 150 \xb0C. By contrast with the P-E hysteresis loop, the change of bipolar S-E hysteresis loop with temperature of the ACP PMN-0.26 PT single crystal shows more intricated behavior. As presented in b, the S-E loop becomes broader, has larger strain and hysteresis, and exhibits obvious negative strain between 60 \xb0C and 90 \xb0C, correlating with the temperature induced R-T ferroelectric phase transition. Above 90 \xb0C, the positive strain tends to increase with further elevating temperature, mainly relating to the increased lattice expansion and easier switching of ferroelectric domains.

The change of maximum strain Smax is more obvious around the R-T phase transition temperature (TR-T), which increases greatly from 0.37 % at room temperature and varies around 0.46 % near TR-T (60\u201390 \xb0C), and then decreases sharply to 0.31 % at 100 \xb0C.

With further elevating the external electric field, the content of T phase increases gradually, leading to the gradual decrease of d33\u2217 value (varying within 6768-4858 p.m./V between 2.41 and 6.21 kV/cm). Above 7.5 kV/cm, the strain hysteresis almost disappears, and the d33\u2217 value significantly decreases to 2458 p.m./V at 15 kV/cm, showing that the PMN-0.26 PT single crystal changes to the T phase completely. At 110 \xb0C, the ACP PMN-0.26 PT single crystal experiences the T-C phase transition at zero electric field, and the T phase still coexists with the C phase at low electric field. The Smax value severely reduces between 110 \xb0C and 150 \xb0C, which can be attributed to the contribution of PNRs with high symmetry in the cubic paraelectric matrix.

Above 2.5 kV/cm, rather large strain is induced and the strain presents nearly linear increase with elevating the external electric field.

As comparison, the DCP sample presents a weaker image since the flipping direction of the electric dipoles tends to be consistent after the DCP poling. Such difference in domain configuration can be explained that during the ACP procedure the electric field is repeatedly applied reversal, which leads to the adjacent 71\xb0 domain walls to flip and eventually merge in the (001)-poled PMN-0.26 PT single crystal. The 71\xb0 domain walls are energetically easily align and reorientate under low-frequency AC electric field due to their lower energy barriers compared to other domain orientations. The enlargement of the 71\xb0 domain width reduces the polarization variation of the <111> polarization and flattens the free energy profile, thereby enhancing the piezoelectricity accordingly. As shown in a, there is no evident splitting of the (100) and (200) diffraction peaks for different PMN-0.26 PT single crystal samples (NOP, DCP, ACP), implying that these samples still present the rhombohedral phase. After poling, the relative XRD intensity of the diffraction peak increases greatly for the DCP and ACP samples as compared with that of the NOP sample. b shows expanded plots of the (100) and (200) diffraction peaks, and the corresponding full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the PMN-0.26 PT single crystal under different states. After poling, FWHM of the (100) and (200) diffraction peaks increases apparently, but has difference on poling methods. For the (100) diffraction peak, there is no apparent difference in terms of FWHM, being 0.216\xb0 and 0.217\xb0 for the DCP and ACP samples, respectively. FWHM of the (200) diffraction peak increases significantly and presents great difference under different poling methods, being 0.274\xb0, 0.510\xb0 and 0.428\xb0 for the NOP, DCP and ACP samples, respectively. Such increase of FWHM indicates that the ACP and DCP poling increase the domain size and decrease the homogeneity of domain structure. Compared with DCP, FWHM of (200) after ACP is 16.1 % smaller, indirectly revealing that the domain size is smaller and the domain structure is more homogeneous after ACP. In addition, the 2\u03b8 degree of both (100) and (200) diffraction peaks moves towards higher angles, being the DCP (22.21\xb0, 45.13\xb0) and ACP (22.17\xb0, 45.11\xb0) samples, respectively, compared with the NOP (22.11\xb0, 44.99\xb0) sample. In brief, the change of diffraction peaks reflects the total free energy variation of the PMN-0.26 PT single crystal under different states caused by poling. This difference also indicates that the crystal structure formed in the ACP sample has a lower energy barrier than that of the DCP sample, which is related to the presence of 71\xb0 domain structure. This conclusion is well consistent with the results of PFM characterization.
**Notes**:
- For precursors, just use the chemical name (no company or purity) and for characterization_techniques, only the instrument name or short name of the instrument for the instruments like XRD, Raman Spectroscopy, SEM, TEM etc.
- For synthesis_methods, use the short name of the method if possible, else write the full name and don't use method/reaction word at the end.
