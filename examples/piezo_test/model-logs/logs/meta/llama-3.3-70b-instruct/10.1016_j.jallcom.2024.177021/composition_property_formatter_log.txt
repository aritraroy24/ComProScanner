**Description**: Format the extracted material composition and properties data. Focus on the 'Notes' if anything is provided. You MUST use 'MaterialParserTool' as tool if there is any variable in the composition in {'composition_extracted_data': {'compositions_property_values': {'Bi3Ti1.5W0.5O9': 7.5, 'Bi3Ti(1.5-0.01)Nb0.01W0.5O9': None, 'Bi3Ti(1.5-0.02)Nb0.02W0.5O9': 13, 'Bi3Ti(1.5-0.04)Nb0.04W0.5O9': None, 'Bi3Ti(1.5-0.06)Nb0.06W0.5O9': None}, 'abbreviations': {'BTW': 'Bi3Ti1.5W0.5O9', 'BTW-xNb': 'Bi3Ti(1.5-x)Nb(x)W0.5O9'}, 'property_unit': 'pC/N', 'family': 'Bismuth Layered Structured Ferroelectric Oxides (BLSFs)'}}. You MUST use the final output from the material parser tool as the final answer for such cases. Just resolve the variables - but don't do any final numerical calculation to get the composition percentage by yourself and keep the formula same as the original.
- If any abbreviated form of composition is present rewrite with the actual composition. But DON'T modify the chemical composition / periodic element with chemical name / element name for e.g., Bi should not be replaced with Bismuth or BaTiO3 should not be replaced with Barium titanate.
- If composition has variables with equation, after resolving the variable the formula should be written in a form of BODMAS rule with only () as brackets, + as addition, - as subtraction, * as multiplication and / as division. For e.g, ABx-2y/5C3 is a chemical formula, where A, B, C are periodic elements and x and y are variables with values x=2, y=3, the final chemical formula should be written as AB(2-((2*3)/5))O3 so that BODMAS rule can be applied later.

However, the observation does not contain the resolved variables and the actual compositions for the abbreviated forms. 

We need to manually resolve the variables and rewrite the abbreviated forms.

The composition 'Bi3Ti(1.5-0.01)Nb0.01W0.5O9' can be rewritten as 'Bi3Ti(1.5-0.01)Nb0.01W0.5O9' = 'Bi3Ti((1.5)-(0.01))Nb(0.01)W0.5O9' = 'Bi3Ti(1.49)Nb0.01W0.5O9'.

Similarly, the composition 'Bi3Ti(1.5-0.02)Nb0.02W0.5O9' can be rewritten as 'Bi3Ti(1.5-0.02)Nb0.02W0.5O9' = 'Bi3Ti((1.5)-(0.02))Nb(0.02)W0.5O9' = 'Bi3Ti(1.48)Nb0.02W0.5O9'.

The composition 'Bi3Ti(1.5-0.04)Nb0.04W0.5O9' can be rewritten as 'Bi3Ti(1.5-0.04)Nb0.04W0.5O9' = 'Bi3Ti((1.5)-(0.04))Nb(0.04)W0.5O9' = 'Bi3Ti(1.46)Nb0.04W0.5O9'.

The composition 'Bi3Ti(1.5-0.06)Nb0.06W0.5O9' can be rewritten as 'Bi3Ti(1.5-0.06)Nb0.06W0.5O9' = 'Bi3Ti((1.5)-(0.06))Nb(0.06)W0.5O9' = 'Bi3Ti(1.44)Nb0.06W0.5O9'.

The 'BTW' abbreviation can be replaced with its actual composition 'Bi3Ti1.5W0.5O9'.

The 'BTW-xNb' abbreviation can be replaced with its actual composition 'Bi3Ti(1.5-x)Nb(x)W0.5O9', but since it is not directly used in the compositions, we do not need to replace it.

Thought: Now that we have resolved the variables and rewritten the abbreviated forms, we can format the data according to the specified output criteria.

The formatted data will contain the compositions with their corresponding properties, the property unit, and the family.
