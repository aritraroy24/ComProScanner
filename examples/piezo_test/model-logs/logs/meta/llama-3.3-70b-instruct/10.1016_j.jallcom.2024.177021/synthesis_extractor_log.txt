In this experiment, Bi3Ti(1.5-x)Nb x W0.5O9 (x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, BTW-xNb) ceramics were prepared. These included Bi2O3(99.999 %, Jiang Su Jincheng Reagent Co., Ltd. China), WO3(99.99 %, Xilong Scientific Co., Ltd), Nb2O5(99.5 %, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd), and TiO2(99.99 %, Xian Tao Zhongxing Electronic Co., Ltd). The BTW-xNb ceramic samples were prepared by ball milling and crushing with zirconia balls and anhydrous ethanol as the media, followed by pre-firing and sintering(KSL-1700X, Hefei Kejing Material Technology Co., Ltd.). The mass ratio of the raw material, ball mill sub and anhydrous ethanol during ball milling was 1:2:1.5, with a ball milling time of 24 h(QM-C1, Nanjing Nanda Instrument Co., Ltd.). The samples were pre-sintered at 800 \xb0C with a holding time of 2 h, and pelletised with 5 wt% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Following a 24-hour ageing period, the material was subjected to a pressure of 16 MPa and subsequently debonded(769YP-24B, Tianjin Keqi High tech Co., Ltd.). The material was then placed in a muffle furnace at temperatures between 1010 and 1030\xb0C for sintering. The crystal structure of BTW-xNb was analysed by X-ray diffraction(XRD, D8 Advance25, Germany Bruker), the local structural changes of the sample were investigated by Raman spectroscopy(LabRAW HR 800 UV, HORIBA Jobin Yvon), and the valence states of (O, Bi) of the sample were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS, Nexsa G2, ThermoFisher). The surface morphology of the samples was observed by scanning electron microscopy(SEM, JSM-6700F, Japan JEOL Ltd.). The dielectric properties, Curie temperature and impedance of the BTW-xNb ceramic were tested using a precision impedance analyser(Agilent4294 A, Agilent Technologies Inc). The resistance of the samples was measured using an insulation resistivity meter (TH 2684, Changzhou Tonghui Electronic Co., Ltd.) and the DC resistivity was calculated. The P-E and I-E curves of the samples were tested with a ferroelectric analyser (TF Analyzer 2000, aixACCT, Germany) at 160 \xb0C and 10 Hz. The samples were coated with silver on both sides to form electrodes, placed in silicone oil at 160 \xb0C and subjected to a DC field of 11\u201318 kV/mm for 30 min. The piezoelectric coefficients(d 33) were then tested at room temperature and at different annealing temperatures using a quasistatic d 33 measuring device (ZJ-3A, The Institute of Acoustics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China).

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
a presents XRD patterns of the BTW-xNb ceramics in the range of 10\u201390\xb0 at room temperature. All diffraction peaks of the components align with the standard diffraction card (PDF#31\u20130204), and it is evident that the most pronounced peak (115) correlates with the most intense peak of the bismuth-layered structure, specifically (112 m+1). The ceramic samples exhibit an orthorhombic bismuth layered structure of the space group A21 am, and there is no detection of a second phase. This indicates that Nb is completely dissolved in the BTW crystals. As illustrated in b, the peak (115) undergoes a gradual shift towards a lower angle with the increase of NbE^{5+} ions. This change is due to the replacement of TiE^{4+} (0.0605 nm, 6 CN) with NbE^{5+} (0.064 nm, 6 CN), which has a larger ionic radius and thus enlarges the ceramic lattice. This is known to have a smaller angle between incoming rays and crystalline surfaces, as demonstrated by Bragg's equation 2dsin\u03b8=n\u03bb. To see how doping affects the structure, the XRD data were subjected to Rietveld refinement using GSASII software. c shows a, b and c of the BTW-xNb ceramics. d illustrates the values of 2(a-b)/(a+b) and the cell volume for each component. For orthorhombic phase BTW ceramics, the cell volume can be obtained from the product of cell parameters a, b and c. This phenomenon is reflected in the shift of the main peak of (115) to a lower angle in b, which is related to the change in crystal spacing. In this study, the value of c is basically unchanged, and an increase in the value of b may be beneficial to the increase of spontaneous polarization, thus optimising the electrical properties of BTW ceramics. For BLSFs, the magnitude of the ratio 2(a-b)/(a+b) represents the degree of orthorhombicity , with larger values indicating greater orthorhombicity. shows that the 2(a-b)/(a+b) ratio decreases with increasing Nb doping, indicating a weakening of the degree of orthorhombic distortion. a\u2013d illustrate the plots of the refinement results for the BTW-xNb ceramics. The calculated refinement factors (R wp, GOF) are deemed to be reasonable, thereby indicating that the results are trustworthy. Consequently, the structure of the [BO6] octahedron is depicted. e\u2013i present the three-dimensional models of [BO6] octahedra derived from X-ray diffraction (XRD) refinement. Variation in the O1-Ti1-O3 pinch angle is indicative of the structural change of [BO6] octahedra within the a-b plane. From the visualised structure (f), it can be observed that the angle of O1-Ti1-O3 increases after doping with NbE^{5+} ions, indicating that NbE^{5+} doping weakens the degree of distortion of the [BO6] octahedra. This may be due to the replacement of TiE^{4+} by NbE^{5+}, which weakens the covalent bonding due to the larger stretching of the Nb-4d orbitals compared to the Ti-3d orbitals, and the weakening of the bonding energy by hybridisation of the Nb-4d orbitals with O-2p. This leads to greater relaxation of the [BO6] octahedra, which in turn leads to weakened structural distortion of the [BO6] octahedra. In the oxygen octahedra, the displacement space of atoms along the c-axis increases, which is beneficial for piezoelectric properties. a-e presents the SEM images of the natural surface of BTW-xNb ceramics after sintering. The figure clearly demonstrates that the BTW-xNb ceramics exhibit significant anisotropy, exhibiting typical bismuth layered structured ceramic lamellar grains. In order to investigate the evolution of grain size in BTW-xNb ceramics, the distributions of grain length and thickness are showed in g and h, respectively. There is a tendency for the average size of ceramic grains to decrease with NbE^{5+} ion doping, which is consistent with the pattern of the effect of NbE^{5+} doping on grain size reported by the previous work. The decrease in grain size due to NbE^{5+} doping may be attributed to a reduction in the mobility of the grain boundary region, which impedes the migration to the grain boundary. This is consistent with the fact that NbE^{5+} doping in bismuth layered piezoelectric ceramics has been reported to reduce the diffusion kinetics of grain growth, thereby limiting the anisotropy of grain growth. Furthermore, the replacement of TiE^{4+} ions with high-valent NbE^{5+} ions is an effective method for the reduction of oxygen vacancies (which will be discussed subsequently). Raman scattering spectroscopy enables the qualitative analysis of the vibrations of molecules or groups, thus providing insight into the crystal structure. depicts the Raman scattering spectrum of BTW-xNb. All the samples were fitted by a Lorentz function, which could be well fitted into 12 independent Raman modes and labelled as v1-v12 sequentially. For bismuth layer structure piezoelectric ceramics, modes at low frequencies (<200 cmE^{\u22121}) are in close contact with A-site ions, and modes at high frequencies (>200 cmE^{\u22121}) depend on the twisted stretching of the [BO6] octahedron. The figure indicates that the Raman mode v1 is essentially free of frequency shifts, which suggests that the NbE^{5+} ions have not replaced the BiE^{3+} ions of the bismuth oxide layer (Bi2O2)E^{2+}.Raman modes v2 and v3 also demonstrated a lack of significant frequency shifts, indicating that NbE^{5+} ions did not enter the A-site in the pseudo-perovskite layer. Raman modes v4 and v5 both exhibit a weak frequency shift, which may be attributed to the substitution of NbE^{5+} (0.064 nm, 6 CN) for TiE^{4+} (0.0605 nm, 6 CN), resulting in the vibration of the octahedron and a consequent alteration in the environment of the A-site. From the figure, it can be observed that there is a weakening of the Raman modes v8 and v12 peak intensities, which indicates that the lattice distortion is reduced. This is in agreement with the XRD refinement. Raman modes v9 and v11 are slightly shifted towards higher frequencies with the doping of NbE^{5+} ions, which may be due to the weak expansion of the octahedra by the substitution of TiE^{4+} by NbE^{5+} ions. The Raman mode v10 is shifted to lower frequencies, which may be due to the larger atomic mass of Nb than Ti , which is consistent with the analysis that the main peak of XRD is shifted to a lower angle, further confirming the substitution of B-site TiE^{4+} by NbE^{5+}. a illustrates a split-peak fit of the XPS energy spectrum of O1s in the BTW-xNb ceramic sample. The peaks at low binding energy correspond to lattice oxygen (OL), while the peaks at higher binding energies are related to oxygen vacancies (OV). The ratio of the peak areas of OV and OL is employed to express the concentration of oxygen vacancies. As illustrated in , the oxygen vacancy concentration of BTW-0.02 Nb ceramics exhibits a reduction from 0.83 to 0.66, which indicates that NbE^{5+} ion doping is an effective method for reducing the oxygen vacancy concentration. This is due to the fact that the electrons generated by the substitution of high-valent NbE^{5+} for TiE^{4+} will eliminate part of the oxygen vacancies. b illustrates the split-peak fitting of the XPS energy spectrum of Bi 4f in the BTW-xNb ceramic sample. This is due to the fact that NbE^{5+} substitutes the B-site and does not displace the ions on the A-site, resulting in no change in the ionic binding energy of the A-site. An increase in resistivity helps to reduce the leakage current, thereby fully polarising the ceramic and enhancing its piezoelectric properties. a illustrates the variation of DC resistivity of BTW-xNb ceramics with temperature. It is worth noting that the resistivity of ceramic samples doped with NbE^{5+} ions is significantly higher than that of the pure component. At 500 \xb0C, the DC resistivity of the BTW-0.02 Nb ceramic is 8.24 \xd7 10E^{6} \u03a9\xb7cm, which is approximately one order of magnitude higher than that of the pure component (9.16 \xd7 10E^{5} \u03a9\xb7cm). At high temperatures, the volatilisation of bismuth (Bi) generates oxygen vacancies (V O \u22c5\u22c5) and bismuth vacancies (V Bi \u2032\u2032\u2032), as illustrated in. With regard to the oxygen vacancies, It should be noted that oxygen in the air during sintering and cooling re-enters the oxygen vacancies at the same time as cavities(h \u22c5) are created, as illustrated by. Conversely, the replacement of TiE^{4+} with NbE^{5+} results in the formation of a positively charged centre at the substitution position(Nb Ti \u22c5). The excess electron is bound in its vicinity, and the resulting electron(e \u2032) also eliminates a certain number of oxygen vacancies, as shown in. The donor ion NbE^{5+} replaces the TiE^{4+} ion to produce electrons that neutralise the holes produced by the oxygen vacancies, as shown in. The incorporation of a moderate quantity of NbE^{5+} facilitates a reduction in the concentration of oxygen vacancies and an enhancement in the resistivity of BTW ceramics, which helps to solve the problem of low piezoelectric performance of the BTW ceramics due to the difficulty of sufficient polarization. The conductivity activation energy (E a) of the ceramic is in accordance with Arrhenius' theorem, as demonstrated by the following : where A is the pre-factor and k is the Boltzmann constant. b\u2013f shows a plot of ln\u03c1 versus 1000/T, fitted to the activation energy E a. In the low-temperature part, the activation energy E a values of the components are 0.47 eV to 0.67 eV. This is comparable to the second-order ionization energy of oxygen vacancies, which is estimated to be between 0.6 eV and 1.2 eV. However, in the high-temperature part, the activation energy is between 1.61 eV and 1.81 eV, which is close to half of the band gap. Consequently, at elevated temperatures, the intrinsic conduction mechanism is the dominant factor in the conduction process. illustrates the complex impedance spectrum of the BTW-xNb ceramic sample across a temperature range of 520\u2013600\xb0C. The test data were fitted by a simplified R-C-CRE parallel equivalent circuit using the Z-View program. The observation of two Cole-Cole semicircles in a and only one Cole-Cole semicircle in b\u2013e indicates that the contribution to the impedance of the pure BTW ceramic is the grains and grain boundaries, whereas the main contribution to the impedance of the ceramic after doping with NbE^{5+} ions is the grains. The value of the curve intersecting the (Z\u2032) axis in the figure represents the total complex impedance value. It can be observed that as the temperature decreases, the impedance value increases, indicating a typical negative impedance effect (NTCR). Furthermore, with the increase in NbE^{5+} doping, the impedance value shows a pattern of increasing then decreasing. This suggests that the appropriate amount of NbE^{5+} ion doping can enhance the impedance of BTW ceramics, with a analogous to that observed in DC resistance. The upper-right insets in a\u2013e illustrate the plots of the conductivity of the corresponding components, taken logarithmically with respect to 1000/T, within the temperature range of 520\u2013600\u2103. The activation energies of the components were calculated in accordance with the Arrhenius equation, which states that \u03c3 = \u03c3 0exp(-E/kB T). The activation energies of all samples ranged from 0.90 to 1.26 eV. The threshold for the involvement of oxygen vacancies in the conductance is approximately 1 eV , so there may be oxygen vacancies involved in conductance. The activation energy increases gradually with the increase of NbE^{5+} ion doping. The replacement of TiE^{4+} with NbE^{5+} effectively diminishes the oxygen vacancy concentration and significantly improves the high temperature impedance. a illustrates \u03b5 r and tan \u03b4 as a function of temperature for BTW-xNb ceramic at a frequency of 1 MHz. The Curie temperature T C of pure BTW ceramics is 730\xb0C, which is consistent with the direct transition of the Aurivilius phase Bi3Ti1.5W0.5O9 from the space group A21 am to I4/mmm at 735\xb0C, as demonstrated by Neil C. The initial increase in the pure system at the doping amount of NbE^{5+} ions (x = 0.04) from 730 \xb0C to 750 \xb0C indicates that NbE^{5+} ion doping significantly increases the T C of BTW ceramics. This may be attributed to the higher electronegativity of the NbE^{5+} ions compared to that of TiE^{4+}, and the increase in the radius of the B-site ions after the substitution of NbE^{5+} (0.064 nm, 6 CN) for TiE^{4+} (0.0605 nm, 6 CN). The substitution of TiE^{4+} results in an increase in the B-site ion radius, which subsequently leads to a decrease in the tolerance factor t. The dielectric constant exhibits relatively stable behaviour prior to 500\xb0C, as evidenced by the dielectric temperature spectrum. In this context, the temperature stability coefficient of the dielectric constant (Tk \u03b5 ) is introduced as a means of investigating the stability of the dielectric constant. The following equation is employed: Where \u03b5 T and \u03b5 T0 are the dielectric constants at temperature T and room temperature T 0, respectively , and b the Tk \u03b5 variation plot for BTW-xNb ceramics. As illustrated in the curves, the Tk \u03b5 of each sample exhibits a slight increase with rising temperature. At a temperature of 500 \xb0C, the Tk \u03b5 remains below 1.50 \xd7 10E^{\u22123} \xb0CE^{\u22121}, suggesting that the moderate doping of the BTW-xNb ceramics has the potential for dielectric service at high temperatures. c shows the dielectric peaks of the BTW-xNb ceramic at varying frequencies. The degree of BTW dispersion was investigated using the Curie-Weiss formula: where \u03b5 r is the relative permittivity at T, \u03b5 m is the relative permittivity at T m (i.e., T C ), and C is a constant. The dispersion factor, \u03b3, has a value between 1 and 2. depicts the plot of ln(1/\u03b5-1/\u03b5 m ) versus ln(T-T C ) at 100 kHz, which is in accordance with the corresponding \u03b3. The value of the dispersion factor \u03b3 gradually increases from 1.15 to 1.39, indicating that the degree of dispersion of this material becomes larger with the increase of NbE^{5+} ion doping. According to the Smolensky compositional fluctuation theory, this may be attributed to the inhomogeneous behaviour of the lattice and composition following B-site doping with NbE^{5+}. Furthermore, all ceramic samples exhibit a low level of dielectric loss up to 400 \xb0C. However, dielectric loss increases after the Curie temperature T C. d illustrates the tan \u03b4 and its ratio to tan \u03b4 (RT) at 500 \xb0C for all components. The tan \u03b4 decreases from 21.1 % (undoped) to 8.2 % (BTW-0.02 Nb), and tan \u03b4/tan \u03b4 (RT) also decreases at 500 \xb0C, indicating that doping NbE^{5+} optimises the tan \u03b4 of the BTW. This may be attributed to the fact that the substitution of NbE^{5+} in place of TiE^{4+} produces electrons which neutralise holes produced by oxygen vacancies, thus increasing the resistivity of the ceramic sample and reducing the losses. a\u2013e shows the P-E and I-E curves of BTW-xNb ceramics at 10 Hz and 160\xb0C. In order to observe more visually the evolution of ferroelectric properties, f presents the trend plots of the coercive electric field (2E c) and the remanent polarization (2P r ) for each component. As the degree of doping increases, the value of P r initially rises, reaches a maximum value at x = 0.02, and then declines. The piezoelectric equation (d = 2\u03b5P r Q ) indicates that high P r values result in elevated piezoelectric coefficients (d 33) in BTW-0.02 Nb, which is consistent with the d 33 law. The remanent polarization intensity (P r ) increases from 4.95 \u03bcC/cm\xb2 (pure system) to 10 \u03bcC/cm\xb2 (BTW \u22120.02 Nb). The improvement of P r in this experiment is attributed to the reduced concentration of oxygen vacancies in the NbE^{5+} doped ceramics, which attenuates the pinning effect of the domains and inhibits the interactions between the domain walls and the oxygen vacancies, leading to a higher degree of domain flipping at the same electric field. It is worthy of note that the P-E return line in is asymmetric (E c+ \u2260 E c-). This is due to the influence of internal bias fields within the material. a illustrates the d 33 of the BTW-xNb ceramic following polarization. With increasing NbE^{5+} doping, the d 33 value reaches a maximum of approximately 13 pC/N at doping level x = 0.02 (about twice undoped) and then subsequently decreases. The analysis of XRD refinement results concludes the successful synthesis of BTW-based ceramics (no second phase generation), and the reduction of the O-Ti-O angle in the oxygen octahedron provides more space for the movement of the B-site ions in the oxygen octahedron, which facilitates the piezoelectric properties. In the case of XPS and resistivity, it is shown that Nb ion doping decreases the concentration of oxygen vacancies in the ceramics and greatly increases the resistivity of the ceramics (8.24\xd710E^{6}\u03a9\xb7cm at 500 \u2103). It is observed from the hysteresis return line that the hysteresis return line is fuller at x=0.02, indicating that Nb doping can effectively enhance the switching of ferroelectric domains in the BTW-based ceramics, which is beneficial to the piezoelectric performance. In addition, the trend of the residual polarization strength (P r ) is the same as that of the piezoelectric constant (d 33). The two, P r and d 33, are tightly correlated, and the increase of P r is beneficial to the enhancement of d 33. Furthermore, it has been observed that excessive Nb doping results in a reduction in d 33. This may be attributed to a decline in resistivity and an increase in dielectric loss, which ultimately leads to a ceramic that is not adequately polarised. b illustrates the d 33 versus depolarization temperature curves for the BTW-xNb ceramic, which were maintained at each temperature point for 30 min and allowed to naturally cool to room temperature. It can be observed that the variation of d 33 with temperature is minimal within the range of room temperature to 700 \xb0C. The ceramic with x = 0.02 demonstrates excellent temperature stability, exhibiting a decrease in d 33 of only 13.84 % at 700 \xb0C in comparison to room temperature. c presents a comparative analysis of the properties of BTW-0.00 Nb and BTW-0.02 Nb ceramics. All properties of the BTW-0.02 Nb sample exhibit marked improvement in comparison to those of the BTW-0.00 Nb sample. Among the observed changes, the d 33, P r , and \u03c1 dc exhibited notable increases, from 7.5 pC/N, 4.95 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, and 9.16 \xd7 10E^{5} \u03a9\xb7cm (500 \xb0C) to 13 pC/N, 10 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, and 8.24 \xd7 10E^{6} \u03a9\xb7cm (500 \xb0C), respectively. Furthermore, the tan\u03b4 value decreased from 21.1 % to 8.2 % (500 \xb0C). In conclusion, the BTW-0.02 Nb ceramic have the potential to be utilised in applications at high temperatures.

All the samples were fitted by a Lorentz function, which could be well fitted into 12 independent Raman modes and labelled as v1-v12 sequentially. For bismuth layer structure piezoelectric ceramics, modes at low frequencies (<200 cmE^{\u22121}) are in close contact with A-site ions, and modes at high frequencies (>200 cmE^{\u22121}) depend on the twisted stretching of the [BO6] octahedron. The figure indicates that the Raman mode v1 is essentially free of frequency shifts, which suggests that the NbE^{5+} ions have not replaced the BiE^{3+} ions of the bismuth oxide layer (Bi2O2)E^{2+}.Raman modes v2 and v3 also demonstrated a lack of significant frequency shifts, indicating that NbE^{5+} ions did not enter the A-site in the pseudo-perovskite layer. Raman modes v4 and v5 both exhibit a weak frequency shift, which may be attributed to the substitution of NbE^{5+} (0.064 nm, 6 CN) for TiE^{4+} (0.0605 nm, 6 CN), resulting in the vibration of the octahedron and a consequent alteration in the environment of the A-site. From the figure, it can be observed that there is a weakening of the Raman modes v8 and v12 peak intensities, which indicates that the lattice distortion is reduced. This is in agreement with the XRD refinement. Raman modes v9 and v11 are slightly shifted towards higher frequencies with the doping of NbE^{5+} ions, which may be due to the weak expansion of the octahedra by the substitution of TiE^{4+} by NbE^{5+} ions. The Raman mode v10 is shifted to lower frequencies, which may be due to the larger atomic mass of Nb than Ti , which is consistent with the analysis that the main peak of XRD is shifted to a lower angle, further confirming the substitution of B-site TiE^{4+} by NbE^{5+}. a illustrates a split-peak fit of the XPS energy spectrum of O1s in the BTW-xNb ceramic sample. The peaks at low binding energy correspond to lattice oxygen (OL), while the peaks at higher binding energies are related to oxygen vacancies (OV). The ratio of the peak areas of OV and OL is employed to express the concentration of oxygen vacancies. As illustrated in , the oxygen vacancy concentration of BTW-0.02 Nb ceramics exhibits a reduction from 0.83 to 0.66, which indicates that NbE^{5+} ion doping is an effective method for reducing the oxygen vacancy concentration. This is due to the fact that the electrons generated by the substitution of high-valent NbE^{5+} for TiE^{4+} will eliminate part of the oxygen vacancies. b illustrates the split-peak fitting of the XPS energy spectrum of Bi 4f in the BTW-xNb ceramic sample. This is due to the fact that NbE^{5+} substitutes the B-site and does not displace the ions on the A-site, resulting in no change in the ionic binding energy of the A-site. An increase in resistivity helps to reduce the leakage current, thereby fully polarising the ceramic and enhancing its piezoelectric properties. a illustrates the variation of DC resistivity of BTW-xNb ceramics with temperature. It is worth noting that the resistivity of ceramic samples doped with NbE^{5+} ions is significantly higher than that of the pure component. At 500 \xb0C, the DC resistivity of the BTW-0.02 Nb ceramic is 8.24 \xd7 10E^{6} \u03a9\xb7cm, which is approximately one order of magnitude higher than that of the pure component (9.16 \xd7 10E^{5} \u03a9\xb7cm). At high temperatures, the volatilisation of bismuth (Bi) generates oxygen vacancies (V O \u22c5\u22c5) and bismuth vacancies (V Bi \u2032\u2032\u2032), as illustrated in. With regard to the oxygen vacancies, It should be noted that oxygen in the air during sintering and cooling re-enters the oxygen vacancies at the same time as cavities(h \u22c5) are created, as illustrated by. Conversely, the replacement of TiE^{4+} with NbE^{5+} results in the formation of a positively charged centre at the substitution position(Nb Ti \u22c5). The excess electron is bound in its vicinity, and the resulting electron(e \u2032) also eliminates a certain number of oxygen vacancies, as shown in. The donor ion NbE^{5+} replaces the TiE^{4+} ion to produce electrons that neutralise the holes produced by the oxygen vacancies, as shown in. The incorporation of a moderate quantity of NbE^{5+} facilitates a reduction in the concentration of oxygen vacancies and an enhancement in the resistivity of BTW ceramics, which helps to solve the problem of low piezoelectric performance of the BTW ceramics due to the difficulty of sufficient polarization. The conductivity activation energy (E a) of the ceramic is in accordance with Arrhenius' theorem, as demonstrated by the following : where A is the pre-factor and k is the Boltzmann constant. b\u2013f shows a plot of ln\u03c1 versus 1000/T, fitted to the activation energy E a. In the low-temperature part, the activation energy E a values of the components are 0.47 eV to 0.67 eV. This is comparable to the second-order ionization energy of oxygen vacancies, which is estimated to be between 0.6 eV and 1.2 eV. However, in the high-temperature part, the activation energy is between 1.61 eV and 1.81 eV, which is close to half of the band gap. Consequently, at elevated temperatures, the intrinsic conduction mechanism is the dominant factor in the conduction process. illustrates the complex impedance spectrum of the BTW-xNb ceramic sample across a temperature range of 520\u2013600\xb0C. The test data were fitted by a simplified R-C-CRE parallel equivalent circuit using the Z-View program. The observation of two Cole-Cole semicircles in a and only one Cole-Cole semicircle in b\u2013e indicates that the contribution to the impedance of the pure BTW ceramic is the grains and grain boundaries, whereas the main contribution to the impedance of the ceramic after doping with NbE^{5+} ions is the grains. The value of the curve intersecting the (Z\u2032) axis in the figure represents the total complex impedance value. It can be observed that as the temperature decreases, the impedance value increases, indicating a typical negative impedance effect (NTCR). Furthermore, with the increase in NbE^{5+} doping, the impedance value shows a pattern of increasing then decreasing. This suggests that the appropriate amount of NbE^{5+} ion doping can enhance the impedance of BTW ceramics, with a analogous to that observed in DC resistance. The upper-right insets in a\u2013e illustrate the plots of the conductivity of the corresponding components, taken logarithmically with respect to 1000/T, within the temperature range of 520\u2013600\u2103. The activation energies of the components were calculated in accordance with the Arrhenius equation, which states that \u03c3 = \u03c3 0exp(-E/kB T). The activation energies of all samples ranged from 0.90 to 1.26 eV. The threshold for the involvement of oxygen vacancies in the conductance is approximately 1 eV , so there may be oxygen vacancies involved in conductance. The activation energy increases gradually with the increase of NbE^{5+} ion doping. The replacement of TiE^{4+} with NbE^{5+} effectively diminishes the oxygen vacancy concentration and significantly improves the high temperature impedance. a illustrates \u03b5 r and tan \u03b4 as a function of temperature for BTW-xNb ceramic at a frequency of 1 MHz. The Curie temperature T C of pure BTW ceramics is 730\xb0C, which is consistent with the direct transition of the Aurivilius phase Bi3Ti1.5W0.5O9 from the space group A21 am to I4/mmm at 735\xb0C, as demonstrated by Neil C. The initial increase in the pure system at the doping amount of NbE^{5+} ions (x = 0.04) from 730 \xb0C to 750 \xb0C indicates that NbE^{5+} ion doping significantly increases the T C of BTW ceramics. This may be attributed to the higher electronegativity of the NbE^{5+} ions compared to that of TiE^{4+}, and the increase in the radius of the B-site ions after the substitution of NbE^{5+} (0.064 nm, 6 CN) for TiE^{4+} (0.0605 nm, 6 CN). The substitution of TiE^{4+} results in an increase in the B-site ion radius, which subsequently leads to a decrease in the tolerance factor t. The dielectric constant exhibits relatively stable behaviour prior to 500\xb0C, as evidenced by the dielectric temperature spectrum. In this context, the temperature stability coefficient of the dielectric constant (Tk \u03b5 ) is introduced as a means of investigating the stability of the dielectric constant. The following equation is employed: Where \u03b5 T and \u03b5 T0 are the dielectric constants at temperature T and room temperature T 0, respectively , and b the Tk \u03b5 variation plot for BTW-xNb ceramics. As illustrated in the curves, the Tk \u03b5 of each sample exhibits a slight increase with rising temperature. At a temperature of 500 \xb0C, the Tk \u03b5 remains below 1.50 \xd7 10E^{\u22123} \xb0CE^{\u22121}, suggesting that the moderate doping of the BTW-xNb ceramics has the potential for dielectric service at high temperatures. c shows the dielectric peaks of the BTW-xNb ceramic at varying frequencies. The degree of BTW dispersion was investigated using the Curie-Weiss formula: where \u03b5 r is the relative permittivity at T, \u03b5 m is the relative permittivity at T m (i.e., T C ), and C is a constant. The dispersion factor, \u03b3, has a value between 1 and 2. depicts the plot of ln(1/\u03b5-1/\u03b5 m ) versus ln(T-T C ) at 100 kHz, which is in accordance with the corresponding \u03b3. The value of the dispersion factor \u03b3 gradually increases from 1.15 to 1.39, indicating that the degree of dispersion of this material becomes larger with the increase of NbE^{5+} ion doping. According to the Smolensky compositional fluctuation theory, this may be attributed to the inhomogeneous behaviour of the lattice and composition following B-site doping with NbE^{5+}. Furthermore, all ceramic samples exhibit a low level of dielectric loss up to 400 \xb0C. However, dielectric loss increases after the Curie temperature T C. d illustrates the tan \u03b4 and its ratio to tan \u03b4 (RT) at 500 \xb0C for all components. The tan \u03b4 decreases from 21.1 % (undoped) to 8.2 % (BTW-0.02 Nb), and tan \u03b4/tan \u03b4 (RT) also decreases at 500 \xb0C, indicating that doping NbE^{5+} optimises the tan \u03b4 of the BTW. This may be attributed to the fact that the substitution of NbE^{5+} in place of TiE^{4+} produces electrons which neutralise holes produced by oxygen vacancies, thus increasing the resistivity of the ceramic sample and reducing the losses. a\u2013e shows the P-E and I-E curves of BTW-xNb ceramics at 10 Hz and 160\xb0C. In order to observe more visually the evolution of ferroelectric properties, f presents the trend plots of the coercive electric field (2E c) and the remanent polarization (2P r ) for each component. As the degree of doping increases, the value of P r initially rises, reaches a maximum value at x = 0.02, and then declines. The piezoelectric equation (d = 2\u03b5P r Q ) indicates that high P r values result in elevated piezoelectric coefficients (d 33) in BTW-0.02 Nb, which is consistent with the d 33 law. The remanent polarization intensity (P r ) increases from 4.95 \u03bcC/cm\xb2 (pure system) to 10 \u03bcC/cm\xb2 (BTW \u22120.02 Nb). The improvement of P r in this experiment is attributed to the reduced concentration of oxygen vacancies in the NbE^{5+} doped ceramics, which attenuates the pinning effect of the domains and inhibits the interactions between the domain walls and the oxygen vacancies, leading to a higher degree of domain flipping at the same electric field. It is worthy of note that the P-E return line in is asymmetric (E c+ \u2260 E c-). This is due to the influence of internal bias fields within the material. a illustrates the d 33 of the BTW-xNb ceramic following polarization. With increasing NbE^{5+} doping, the d 33 value reaches a maximum of approximately 13 pC/N at doping level x = 0.02 (about twice undoped) and then subsequently decreases. The analysis of XRD refinement results concludes the successful synthesis of BTW-based ceramics (no second phase generation), and the reduction of the O-Ti-O angle in the oxygen octahedron provides more space for the movement of the B-site ions in the oxygen octahedron, which facilitates the piezoelectric properties. In the case of XPS and resistivity, it is shown that Nb ion doping decreases the concentration of oxygen vacancies in the ceramics and greatly increases the resistivity of the ceramics (8.24\xd710E^{6}\u03a9\xb7cm at 500 \u2103). It is observed from the hysteresis return line that the hysteresis return line is fuller at x=0.02, indicating that Nb doping can effectively enhance the switching of ferroelectric domains in the BTW-based ceramics, which is beneficial to the piezoelectric performance. In addition, the trend of the residual polarization strength (P r ) is the same as that of the piezoelectric constant (d 33). The two, P r and d 33, are tightly correlated, and the increase of P r is beneficial to the enhancement of d 33. Furthermore, it has been observed that excessive Nb doping results in a reduction in d 33. This may be attributed to a decline in resistivity and an increase in dielectric loss, which ultimately leads to a ceramic that is not adequately polarised. b illustrates the d 33 versus depolarization temperature curves for the BTW-xNb ceramic, which were maintained at each temperature point for 30 min and allowed to naturally cool to room temperature. It can be observed that the variation of d 33 with temperature is minimal within the range of room temperature to 700 \xb0C. The ceramic with x = 0.02 demonstrates excellent temperature stability, exhibiting a decrease in d 33 of only 13.84 % at 700 \xb0C in comparison to room temperature. c presents a comparative analysis of the properties of BTW-0.00 Nb and BTW-0.02 Nb ceramics. All properties of the BTW-0.02 Nb sample exhibit marked improvement in comparison to those of the BTW-0.00 Nb sample. Among the observed changes, the d 33, P r , and \u03c1 dc exhibited notable increases, from 7.5 pC/N, 4.95 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, and 9.16 \xd7 10E^{5} \u03a9\xb7cm (500 \xb0C) to 13 pC/N, 10 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, and 8.24 \xd7 10E^{6} \u03a9\xb7cm (500 \xb0C), respectively. Furthermore, the tan\u03b4 value decreased from 21.1 % to 8.2 % (500 \xb0C). In conclusion, the BTW-0.02 Nb ceramic have the potential to be utilised in applications at high temperatures.

In this experiment, Bi3Ti(1.5-x)Nb x W0.5O9 (x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, BTW-xNb) ceramics were prepared. These included Bi2O3(99.999 %, Jiang Su Jincheng Reagent Co., Ltd. China), WO3(99.99 %, Xilong Scientific Co., Ltd), Nb2O5(99.5 %, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd), and TiO2(99.99 %, Xian Tao Zhongxing Electronic Co., Ltd). The BTW-xNb ceramic samples were prepared by ball milling and crushing with zirconia balls and anhydrous ethanol as the media, followed by pre-firing and sintering(KSL-1700X, Hefei Kejing Material Technology Co., Ltd.). The mass ratio of the raw material, ball mill sub and anhydrous ethanol during ball milling was 1:2:1.5, with a ball milling time of 24 h(QM-C1, Nanjing Nanda Instrument Co., Ltd.). The samples were pre-sintered at 800 \xb0C with a holding time of 2 h, and pelletised with 5 wt% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Following a 24-hour ageing period, the material was subjected to a pressure of 16 MPa and subsequently debonded(769YP-24B, Tianjin Keqi High tech Co., Ltd.). The material was then placed in a muffle furnace at temperatures between 1010 and 1030\xb0C for sintering. The crystal structure of BTW-xNb was analysed by X-ray diffraction(XRD, D8 Advance25, Germany Bruker), the local structural changes of the sample were investigated by Raman spectroscopy(LabRAW HR 800 UV, HORIBA Jobin Yvon), and the valence states of (O, Bi) of the sample were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS, Nexsa G2, ThermoFisher). The surface morphology of the samples was observed by scanning electron microscopy(SEM, JSM-6700F, Japan JEOL Ltd.). The dielectric properties, Curie temperature and impedance of the BTW-xNb ceramic were tested using a precision impedance analyser(Agilent4294 A, Agilent Technologies Inc). The resistance of the samples was measured using an insulation resistivity meter (TH 2684, Changzhou Tonghui Electronic Co., Ltd.) and the DC resistivity was calculated. The P-E and I-E curves of the samples were tested with a ferroelectric analyser (TF Analyzer 2000, aixACCT, Germany) at 160 \xb0C and 10 Hz. The samples were coated with silver on both sides to form electrodes, placed in silicone oil at 160 \xb0C and subjected to a DC field of 11\u201318 kV/mm for 30 min. The piezoelectric coefficients(d 33) were then tested at room temperature and at different annealing temperatures using a quasistatic d 33 measuring device (ZJ-3A, The Institute of Acoustics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China).

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
a presents XRD patterns of the BTW-xNb ceramics in the range of 10\u201390\xb0 at room temperature. All diffraction peaks of the components align with the standard diffraction card (PDF#31\u20130204), and it is evident that the most pronounced peak (115) correlates with the most intense peak of the bismuth-layered structure, specifically (112 m+1). The ceramic samples exhibit an orthorhombic bismuth layered structure of the space group A21 am, and there is no detection of a second phase. This indicates that Nb is completely dissolved in the BTW crystals. As illustrated in b, the peak (115) undergoes a gradual shift towards a lower angle with the increase of NbE^{5+} ions. This change is due to the replacement of TiE^{4+} (0.0605 nm, 6 CN) with NbE^{5+} (0.064 nm, 6 CN), which has a larger ionic radius and thus enlarges the ceramic lattice. This is known to have a smaller angle between incoming rays and crystalline surfaces, as demonstrated by Bragg's equation 2dsin\u03b8=n\u03bb. To see how doping affects the structure, the XRD data were subjected to Rietveld refinement using GSASII software. c shows a, b and c of the BTW-xNb ceramics. d illustrates the values of 2(a-b)/(a+b) and the cell volume for each component. For orthorhombic phase BTW ceramics, the cell volume can be obtained from the product of cell parameters a, b and c. This phenomenon is reflected in the shift of the main peak of (115) to a lower angle in b, which is related to the change in crystal spacing. In this study, the value of c is basically unchanged, and an increase in the value of b may be beneficial to the increase of spontaneous polarization, thus optimising the electrical properties of BTW ceramics. For BLSFs, the magnitude of the ratio 2(a-b)/(a+b) represents the degree of orthorhombicity , with larger values indicating greater orthorhombicity. shows that the 2(a-b)/(a+b) ratio decreases with increasing Nb doping, indicating a weakening of the degree of orthorhombic distortion. a\u2013d illustrate the plots of the refinement results for the BTW-xNb ceramics. The calculated refinement factors (R wp, GOF) are deemed to be reasonable, thereby indicating that the results are trustworthy. Consequently, the structure of the [BO6] octahedron is depicted. e\u2013i present the three-dimensional models of [BO6] octahedra derived from X-ray diffraction (XRD) refinement. Variation in the O1-Ti1-O3 pinch angle is indicative of the structural change of [BO6] octahedra within the a-b plane. From the visualised structure (f), it can be observed that the angle of O1-Ti1-O3 increases after doping with NbE^{5+} ions, indicating that NbE^{5+} doping weakens the degree of distortion of the [BO6] octahedra. This may be due to the replacement of TiE^{4+} by NbE^{5+}, which weakens the covalent bonding due to the larger stretching of the Nb-4d orbitals compared to the Ti-3d orbitals, and the weakening of the bonding energy by hybridisation of the Nb-4d orbitals with O-2p. This leads to greater relaxation of the [BO6] octahedra, which in turn leads to weakened structural distortion of the [BO6] octahedra. In the oxygen octahedra, the displacement space of atoms along the c-axis increases, which is beneficial for piezoelectric properties. a-e presents the SEM images of the natural surface of BTW-xNb ceramics after sintering. The figure clearly demonstrates that the BTW-xNb ceramics exhibit significant anisotropy, exhibiting typical bismuth layered structured ceramic lamellar grains. In order to investigate the evolution of grain size in BTW-xNb ceramics, the distributions of grain length and thickness are showed in g and h, respectively. There is a tendency for the average size of ceramic grains to decrease with NbE^{5+} ion doping, which is consistent with the pattern of the effect of NbE^{5+} doping on grain size reported by the previous work. The decrease in grain size due to NbE^{5+} doping may be attributed to a reduction in the mobility of the grain boundary region, which impedes the migration to the grain boundary. This is consistent with the fact that NbE^{5+} doping in bismuth layered piezoelectric ceramics has been reported to reduce the diffusion kinetics of grain growth, thereby limiting the anisotropy of grain growth. Furthermore, the replacement of TiE^{4+} ions with high-valent NbE^{5+} ions is an effective method for the reduction of oxygen vacancies (which will be discussed subsequently). Raman scattering spectroscopy enables the qualitative analysis of the vibrations of molecules or groups, thus providing insight into the crystal structure. depicts the Raman scattering spectrum of BTW-xNb. All the samples were fitted by a Lorentz function, which could be well fitted into 12 independent Raman modes and labelled as v1-v12 sequentially. For bismuth layer structure piezoelectric ceramics, modes at low frequencies (<200 cmE^{\u22121}) are in close contact with A-site ions, and modes at high frequencies (>200 cmE^{\u22121}) depend on the twisted stretching of the [BO6] octahedron. The figure indicates that the Raman mode v1 is essentially free of frequency shifts, which suggests that the NbE^{5+} ions have not replaced the BiE^{3+} ions of the bismuth oxide layer (Bi2O2)E^{2+}.Raman modes v2 and v3 also demonstrated a lack of significant frequency shifts, indicating that NbE^{5+} ions did not enter the A-site in the pseudo-perovskite layer. Raman modes v4 and v5 both exhibit a weak frequency shift, which may be attributed to the substitution of NbE^{5+} (0.064 nm, 6 CN) for TiE^{4+} (0.0605 nm, 6 CN), resulting in the vibration of the octahedron and a consequent alteration in the environment of the A-site. From the figure, it can be observed that there is a weakening of the Raman modes v8 and v12 peak intensities, which indicates that the lattice distortion is reduced. This is in agreement with the XRD refinement. Raman modes v9 and v11 are slightly shifted towards higher frequencies with the doping of NbE^{5+} ions, which may be due to the weak expansion of the octahedra by the substitution of TiE^{4+} by NbE^{5+} ions. The Raman mode v10 is shifted to lower frequencies, which may be due to the larger atomic mass of Nb than Ti , which is consistent with the analysis that the main peak of XRD is shifted to a lower angle, further confirming the substitution of B-site TiE^{4+} by NbE^{5+}. a illustrates a split-peak fit of the XPS energy spectrum of O1s in the BTW-xNb ceramic sample. The peaks at low binding energy correspond to lattice oxygen (OL), while the peaks at higher binding energies are related to oxygen vacancies (OV). The ratio of the peak areas of OV and OL is employed to express the concentration of oxygen vacancies. As illustrated in , the oxygen vacancy concentration of BTW-0.02 Nb ceramics exhibits a reduction from 0.83 to 0.66, which indicates that NbE^{5+} ion doping is an effective method for reducing the oxygen vacancy concentration. This is due to the fact that the electrons generated by the substitution of high-valent NbE^{5+} for TiE^{4+} will eliminate part of the oxygen vacancies. b illustrates the split-peak fitting of the XPS energy spectrum of Bi 4f in the BTW-xNb ceramic sample. This is due to the fact that NbE^{5+} substitutes the B-site and does not displace the ions on the A-site, resulting in no change in the ionic binding energy of the A-site. An increase in resistivity helps to reduce the leakage current, thereby fully polarising the ceramic and enhancing its piezoelectric properties. a illustrates the variation of DC resistivity of BTW-xNb ceramics with temperature. It is worth noting that the resistivity of ceramic samples doped with NbE^{5+} ions is significantly higher than that of the pure component. At 500 \xb0C, the DC resistivity of the BTW-0.02 Nb ceramic is 8.24 \xd7 10E^{6} \u03a9\xb7cm, which is approximately one order of magnitude higher than that of the pure component (9.16 \xd7 10E^{5} \u03a9\xb7cm). At high temperatures, the volatilisation of bismuth (Bi) generates oxygen vacancies (V O \u22c5\u22c5) and bismuth vacancies (V Bi \u2032\u2032\u2032), as illustrated in. With regard to the oxygen vacancies, It should be noted that oxygen in the air during sintering and cooling re-enters the oxygen vacancies at the same time as cavities(h \u22c5) are created, as illustrated by. Conversely, the replacement of TiE^{4+} with NbE^{5+} results in the formation of a positively charged centre at the substitution position(Nb Ti \u22c5). The excess electron is bound in its vicinity, and the resulting electron(e \u2032) also eliminates a certain number of oxygen vacancies, as shown in. The donor ion NbE^{5+} replaces the TiE^{4+} ion to produce electrons that neutralise the holes produced by the oxygen vacancies, as shown in. The incorporation of a moderate quantity of NbE^{5+} facilitates a reduction in the concentration of oxygen vacancies and an enhancement in the resistivity of BTW ceramics, which helps to solve the problem of low piezoelectric performance of the BTW ceramics due to the difficulty of sufficient polarization. The conductivity activation energy (E a) of the ceramic is in accordance with Arrhenius' theorem, as demonstrated by the following : where A is the pre-factor and k is the Boltzmann constant. b\u2013f shows a plot of ln\u03c1 versus 1000/T, fitted to the activation energy E a. In the low-temperature part, the activation energy E a values of the components are 0.47 eV to 0.67 eV. This is comparable to the second-order ionization energy of oxygen vacancies, which is estimated to be between 0.6 eV and 1.2 eV. However, in the high-temperature part, the activation energy is between 1.61 eV and 1.81 eV, which is close to half of the band gap. Consequently, at elevated temperatures, the intrinsic conduction mechanism is the dominant factor in the conduction process. illustrates the complex impedance spectrum of the BTW-xNb ceramic sample across a temperature range of 520\u2013600\xb0C. The test data were fitted by a simplified R-C-CRE parallel equivalent circuit using the Z-View program. The observation of two Cole-Cole semicircles in a and only one Cole-Cole semicircle in b\u2013e indicates that the contribution to the impedance of the pure BTW ceramic is the grains and grain boundaries, whereas the main contribution to the impedance of the ceramic after doping with NbE^{5+} ions is the grains. The value of the curve intersecting the (Z\u2032) axis in the figure represents the total complex impedance value. It can be observed that as the temperature decreases, the impedance value increases, indicating a typical negative impedance effect (NTCR). Furthermore, with the increase in NbE^{5+} doping, the impedance value shows a pattern of increasing then decreasing. This suggests that the appropriate amount of NbE^{5+} ion doping can enhance the impedance of BTW ceramics, with a analogous to that observed in DC resistance. The upper-right insets in a\u2013e illustrate the plots of the conductivity of the corresponding components, taken logarithmically with respect to 1000/T, within the temperature range of 520\u2013600\u2103. The activation energies of the components were calculated in accordance with the Arrhenius equation, which states that \u03c3 = \u03c3 0exp(-E/kB T). The activation energies of all samples ranged from 0.90 to 1.26 eV. The threshold for the involvement of oxygen vacancies in the conductance is approximately 1 eV , so there may be oxygen vacancies involved in conductance. The activation energy increases gradually with the increase of NbE^{5+} ion doping. The replacement of TiE^{4+} with NbE^{5+} effectively diminishes the oxygen vacancy concentration and significantly improves the high temperature impedance. a illustrates \u03b5 r and tan \u03b4 as a function of temperature for BTW-xNb ceramic at a frequency of 1 MHz. The Curie temperature T C of pure BTW ceramics is 730\xb0C, which is consistent with the direct transition of the Aurivilius phase Bi3Ti1.5W0.5O9 from the space group A21 am to I4/mmm at 735\xb0C, as demonstrated by Neil C. The initial increase in the pure system at the doping amount of NbE^{5+} ions (x = 0.04) from 730 \xb0C to 750 \xb0C indicates that NbE^{5+} ion doping significantly increases the T C of BTW ceramics. This may be attributed to the higher electronegativity of the NbE^{5+} ions compared to that of TiE^{4+}, and the increase in the radius of the B-site ions after the substitution of NbE^{5+} (0.064 nm, 6 CN) for TiE^{4+} (0.0605 nm, 6 CN). The substitution of TiE^{4+} results in an increase in the B-site ion radius, which subsequently leads to a decrease in the tolerance factor t. The dielectric constant exhibits relatively stable behaviour prior to 500\xb0C, as evidenced by the dielectric temperature spectrum. In this context, the temperature stability coefficient of the dielectric constant (Tk \u03b5 ) is introduced as a means of investigating the stability of the dielectric constant. The following equation is employed: Where \u03b5 T and \u03b5 T0 are the dielectric constants at temperature T and room temperature T 0, respectively , and b the Tk \u03b5 variation plot for BTW-xNb ceramics. As illustrated in the curves, the Tk \u03b5 of each sample exhibits a slight increase with rising temperature. At a temperature of 500 \xb0C, the Tk \u03b5 remains below 1.50 \xd7 10E^{\u22123} \xb0CE^{\u22121}, suggesting that the moderate doping of the BTW-xNb ceramics has the potential for dielectric service at high temperatures. c shows the dielectric peaks of the BTW-xNb ceramic at varying frequencies. The degree of BTW dispersion was investigated using the Curie-Weiss formula: where \u03b5 r is the relative permittivity at T, \u03b5 m is the relative permittivity at T m (i.e., T C ), and C is a constant. The dispersion factor, \u03b3, has a value between 1 and 2. depicts the plot of ln(1/\u03b5-1/\u03b5 m ) versus ln(T-T C ) at 100 kHz, which is in accordance with the corresponding \u03b3. The value of the dispersion factor \u03b3 gradually increases from 1.15 to 1.39, indicating that the degree of dispersion of this material becomes larger with the increase of NbE^{5+} ion doping. According to the Smolensky compositional fluctuation theory, this may be attributed to the inhomogeneous behaviour of the lattice and composition following B-site doping with NbE^{5+}. Furthermore, all ceramic samples exhibit a low level of dielectric loss up to 400 \xb0C. However, dielectric loss increases after the Curie temperature T C. d illustrates the tan \u03b4 and its ratio to tan \u03b4 (RT) at 500 \xb0C for all components. The tan \u03b4 decreases from 21.1 % (undoped) to 8.2 % (BTW-0.02 Nb), and tan \u03b4/tan \u03b4 (RT) also decreases at 500 \xb0C, indicating that doping NbE^{5+} optimises the tan \u03b4 of the BTW. This may be attributed to the fact that the substitution of NbE^{5+} in place of TiE^{4+} produces electrons which neutralise holes produced by oxygen vacancies, thus increasing the resistivity of the ceramic sample and reducing the losses. a\u2013e shows the P-E and I-E curves of BTW-xNb ceramics at 10 Hz and 160\xb0C. In order to observe more visually the evolution of ferroelectric properties, f presents the trend plots of the coercive electric field (2E c) and the remanent polarization (2P r ) for each component. As the degree of doping increases, the value of P r initially rises, reaches a maximum value at x = 0.02, and then declines. The piezoelectric equation (d = 2\u03b5P r Q ) indicates that high P r values result in elevated piezoelectric coefficients (d 33) in BTW-0.02 Nb, which is consistent with the d 33 law. The remanent polarization intensity (P r ) increases from 4.95 \u03bcC/cm\xb2 (pure system) to 10 \u03bcC/cm\xb2 (BTW \u22120.02 Nb). The improvement of P r in this experiment is attributed to the reduced concentration of oxygen vacancies in the NbE^{5+} doped ceramics, which attenuates the pinning effect of the domains and inhibits the interactions between the domain walls and the oxygen vacancies, leading to a higher degree of domain flipping at the same electric field. It is worthy of note that the P-E return line in is asymmetric (E c+ \u2260 E c-). This is due to the influence of internal bias fields within the material. a illustrates the d 33 of the BTW-xNb ceramic following polarization. With increasing NbE^{5+} doping, the d 33 value reaches a maximum of approximately 13 pC/N at doping level x = 0.02 (about twice undoped) and then subsequently decreases. The analysis of XRD refinement results concludes the successful synthesis of BTW-based ceramics (no second phase generation), and the reduction of the O-Ti-O angle in the oxygen octahedron provides more space for the movement of the B-site ions in the oxygen octahedron, which facilitates the piezoelectric properties. In the case of XPS and resistivity, it is shown that Nb ion doping decreases the concentration of oxygen vacancies in the ceramics and greatly increases the resistivity of the ceramics (8.24\xd710E^{6}\u03a9\xb7cm at 500 \u2103). It is observed from the hysteresis return line that the hysteresis return line is fuller at x=0.02, indicating that Nb doping can effectively enhance the switching of ferroelectric domains in the BTW-based ceramics, which is beneficial to the piezoelectric performance. In addition, the trend of the residual polarization strength (P r ) is the same as that of the piezoelectric constant (d 33). The two, P r and d 33, are tightly correlated, and the increase of P r is beneficial to the enhancement of d 33. Furthermore, it has been observed that excessive Nb doping results in a reduction in d 33. This may be attributed to a decline in resistivity and an increase in dielectric loss, which ultimately leads to a ceramic that is not adequately polarised. b illustrates the d 33 versus depolarization temperature curves for the BTW-xNb ceramic, which were maintained at each temperature point for 30 min and allowed to naturally cool to room temperature. It can be observed that the variation of d 33 with temperature is minimal within the range of room temperature to 700 \xb0C. The ceramic with x = 0.02 demonstrates excellent temperature stability, exhibiting a decrease in d 33 of only 13.84 % at 700 \xb0C in comparison to room temperature. c presents a comparative analysis of the properties of BTW-0.00 Nb and BTW-0.02 Nb ceramics. All properties of the BTW-0.02 Nb sample exhibit marked improvement in comparison to those of the BTW-0.00 Nb sample. Among the observed changes, the d 33, P r , and \u03c1 dc exhibited notable increases, from 7.5 pC/N, 4.95 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, and 9.16 \xd7 10E^{5} \u03a9\xb7cm (500 \xb0C) to 13 pC/N, 10 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, and 8.24 \xd7 10E^{6} \u03a9\xb7cm (500 \xb0C), respectively. Furthermore, the tan\u03b4 value decreased from 21.1 % to 8.2 % (500 \xb0C). In conclusion, the BTW-0.02 Nb ceramic have the potential to be utilised in applications at high temperatures.

In this experiment, Bi3Ti(1.5-x)Nb x W0.5O9 (x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, BTW-xNb) ceramics were prepared. These included Bi2O3(99.999 %, Jiang Su Jincheng Reagent Co., Ltd. China), WO3(99.99 %, Xilong Scientific Co., Ltd), Nb2O5(99.5 %, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd), and TiO2(99.99 %, Xian Tao Zhongxing Electronic Co., Ltd). The BTW-xNb ceramic samples were prepared by ball milling and crushing with zirconia balls and anhydrous ethanol as the media, followed by pre-firing and sintering(KSL-1700X, Hefei Kejing Material Technology Co., Ltd.). The mass ratio of the raw material, ball mill sub and anhydrous ethanol during ball milling was 1:2:1.5, with a ball milling time of 24 h(QM-C1, Nanjing Nanda Instrument Co., Ltd.). The samples were pre-sintered at 800 \xb0C with a holding time of 2 h, and pelletised with 5 wt% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Following a 24-hour ageing period, the material was subjected to a pressure of 16 MPa and subsequently debonded(769YP-24B, Tianjin Keqi High tech Co., Ltd.). The material was then placed in a muffle furnace at temperatures between 1010 and 1030\xb0C for sintering. The crystal structure of BTW-xNb was analysed by X-ray diffraction(XRD, D8 Advance25, Germany Bruker), the local structural changes of the sample were investigated by Raman spectroscopy(LabRAW HR 800 UV, HORIBA Jobin Yvon), and the valence states of (O, Bi) of the sample were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS, Nexsa G2, ThermoFisher). The surface morphology of the samples was observed by scanning electron microscopy(SEM, JSM-6700F, Japan JEOL Ltd.). The dielectric properties, Curie temperature and impedance of the BTW-xNb ceramic were tested using a precision impedance analyser(Agilent4294 A, Agilent Technologies Inc). The resistance of the samples was measured using an insulation resistivity meter (TH 2684, Changzhou Tonghui Electronic Co., Ltd.) and the DC resistivity was calculated. The P-E and I-E curves of the samples were tested with a ferroelectric analyser (TF Analyzer 2000, aixACCT, Germany) at 160 \xb0C and 10 Hz. The samples were coated with silver on both sides to form electrodes, placed in silicone oil at 160 \xb0C and subjected to a DC field of 11\u201318 kV/mm for 30 min. The piezoelectric coefficients(d 33) were then tested at room temperature and at different annealing temperatures using a quasistatic d 33 measuring device (ZJ-3A, The Institute of Acoustics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China).

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
a presents XRD patterns of the BTW-xNb ceramics in the range of 10\u201390\xb0 at room temperature. All diffraction peaks of the components align with the standard diffraction card (PDF#31\u20130204), and it is evident that the most pronounced peak (115) correlates with the most intense peak of the bismuth-layered structure, specifically (112 m+1). The ceramic samples exhibit an orthorhombic bismuth layered structure of the space group A21 am, and there is no detection of a second phase. This indicates that Nb is completely dissolved in the BTW crystals. As illustrated in b, the peak (115) undergoes a gradual shift towards a lower angle with the increase of NbE^{5+} ions. This change is due to the replacement of TiE^{4+} (0.0605 nm, 6 CN) with NbE^{5+} (0.064 nm, 6 CN), which has a larger ionic radius and thus enlarges the ceramic lattice. This is known to have a smaller angle between incoming rays and crystalline surfaces, as demonstrated by Bragg's equation 2dsin\u03b8=n\u03bb. To see how doping affects the structure, the XRD data were subjected to Rietveld refinement using GSASII software. c shows a, b and c of the BTW-xNb ceramics. d illustrates the values of 2(a-b)/(a+b) and the cell volume for each component. For orthorhombic phase BTW ceramics, the cell volume can be obtained from the product of cell parameters a, b and c. This phenomenon is reflected in the shift of the main peak of (115) to a lower angle in b, which is related to the change in crystal spacing. In this study, the value of c is basically unchanged, and an increase in the value of b may be beneficial to the increase of spontaneous polarization, thus optimising the electrical properties of BTW ceramics. For BLSFs, the magnitude of the ratio 2(a-b)/(a+b) represents the degree of orthorhombicity , with larger values indicating greater orthorhombicity. shows that the 2(a-b)/(a+b) ratio decreases with increasing Nb doping, indicating a weakening of the degree of orthorhombic distortion. a\u2013d illustrate the plots of the refinement results for the BTW-xNb ceramics. The calculated refinement factors (R wp, GOF) are deemed to be reasonable, thereby indicating that the results are trustworthy. Consequently, the structure of the [BO6] octahedron is depicted. e\u2013i present the three-dimensional models of [BO6] octahedra derived from X-ray diffraction (XRD) refinement. Variation in the O1-Ti1-O3 pinch angle is indicative of the structural change of [BO6] octahedra within the a-b plane. From the visualised structure (f), it can be observed that the angle of O1-Ti1-O3 increases after doping with NbE^{5+} ions, indicating that NbE^{5+} doping weakens the degree of distortion of the [BO6] octahedra. This may be due to the replacement of TiE^{4+} by NbE^{5+}, which weakens the covalent bonding due to the larger stretching of the Nb-4d orbitals compared to the Ti-3d orbitals, and the weakening of the bonding energy by hybridisation of the Nb-4d orbitals with O-2p. This leads to greater relaxation of the [BO6] octahedra, which in turn leads to weakened structural distortion of the [BO6] octahedra. In the oxygen octahedra, the displacement space of atoms along the c-axis increases, which is beneficial for piezoelectric properties. a-e presents the SEM images of the natural surface of BTW-xNb ceramics after sintering. The figure clearly demonstrates that the BTW-xNb ceramics exhibit significant anisotropy, exhibiting typical bismuth layered structured ceramic lamellar grains. In order to investigate the evolution of grain size in BTW-xNb ceramics, the distributions of grain length and thickness are showed in g and h, respectively. There is a tendency for the average size of ceramic grains to decrease with NbE^{5+} ion doping, which is consistent with the pattern of the effect of NbE^{5+} doping on grain size reported by the previous work. The decrease in grain size due to NbE^{5+} doping may be attributed to a reduction in the mobility of the grain boundary region, which impedes the migration to the grain boundary. This is consistent with the fact that NbE^{5+} doping in bismuth layered piezoelectric ceramics has been reported to reduce the diffusion kinetics of grain growth, thereby limiting the anisotropy of grain growth. Furthermore, the replacement of TiE^{4+} ions with high-valent NbE^{5+} ions is an effective method for the reduction of oxygen vacancies (which will be discussed subsequently). Raman scattering spectroscopy enables the qualitative analysis of the vibrations of molecules or groups, thus providing insight into the crystal structure. depicts the Raman scattering spectrum of BTW-xNb. All the samples were fitted by a Lorentz function, which could be well fitted into 12 independent Raman modes and labelled as v1-v12 sequentially. For bismuth layer structure piezoelectric ceramics, modes at low frequencies (<200 cmE^{\u22121}) are in close contact with A-site ions, and modes at high frequencies (>200 cmE^{\u22121}) depend on the twisted stretching of the [BO6] octahedron. The figure indicates that the Raman mode v1 is essentially free of frequency shifts, which suggests that the NbE^{5+} ions have not replaced the BiE^{3+} ions of the bismuth oxide layer (Bi2O2)E^{2+}.Raman modes v2 and v3 also demonstrated a lack of significant frequency shifts, indicating that NbE^{5+} ions did not enter the A-site in the pseudo-perovskite layer. Raman modes v4 and v5 both exhibit a weak frequency shift, which may be attributed to the substitution of NbE^{5+} (0.064 nm, 6 CN) for TiE^{4+} (0.0605 nm, 6 CN), resulting in the vibration of the octahedron and a consequent alteration in the environment of the A-site. From the figure, it can be observed that there is a weakening of the Raman modes v8 and v12 peak intensities, which indicates that the lattice distortion is reduced. This is in agreement with the XRD refinement. Raman modes v9 and v11 are slightly shifted towards higher frequencies with the doping of NbE^{5+} ions, which may be due to the weak expansion of the octahedra by the substitution of TiE^{4+} by NbE^{5+} ions. The Raman mode v10 is shifted to lower frequencies, which may be due to the larger atomic mass of Nb than Ti , which is consistent with the analysis that the main peak of XRD is shifted to a lower angle, further confirming the substitution of B-site TiE^{4+} by NbE^{5+}. a illustrates a split-peak fit of the XPS energy spectrum of O1s in the BTW-xNb ceramic sample. The peaks at low binding energy correspond to lattice oxygen (OL), while the peaks at higher binding energies are related to oxygen vacancies (OV). The ratio of the peak areas of OV and OL is employed to express the concentration of oxygen vacancies. As illustrated in , the oxygen vacancy concentration of BTW-0.02 Nb ceramics exhibits a reduction from 0.83 to 0.66, which indicates that NbE^{5+} ion doping is an effective method for reducing the oxygen vacancy concentration. This is due to the fact that the electrons generated by the substitution of high-valent NbE^{5+} for TiE^{4+} will eliminate part of the oxygen vacancies. b illustrates the split-peak fitting of the XPS energy spectrum of Bi 4f in the BTW-xNb ceramic sample. This is due to the fact that NbE^{5+} substitutes the B-site and does not displace the ions on the A-site, resulting in no change in the ionic binding energy of the A-site. An increase in resistivity helps to reduce the leakage current, thereby fully polarising the ceramic and enhancing its piezoelectric properties. a illustrates the variation of DC resistivity of BTW-xNb ceramics with temperature. It is worth noting that the resistivity of ceramic samples doped with NbE^{5+} ions is significantly higher than that of the pure component. At 500 \xb0C, the DC resistivity of the BTW-0.02 Nb ceramic is 8.24 \xd7 10E^{6} \u03a9\xb7cm, which is approximately one order of magnitude higher than that of the pure component (9.16 \xd7 10E^{5} \u03a9\xb7cm). At high temperatures, the volatilisation of bismuth (Bi) generates oxygen vacancies (V O \u22c5\u22c5) and bismuth vacancies (V Bi \u2032\u2032\u2032), as illustrated in. With regard to the oxygen vacancies, It should be noted that oxygen in the air during sintering and cooling re-enters the oxygen vacancies at the same time as cavities(h \u22c5) are created, as illustrated by. Conversely, the replacement of TiE^{4+} with NbE^{5+} results in the formation of a positively charged centre at the substitution position(Nb Ti \u22c5). The excess electron is bound in its vicinity, and the resulting electron(e \u2032) also eliminates a certain number of oxygen vacancies, as shown in. The donor ion NbE^{5+} replaces the TiE^{4+} ion to produce electrons that neutralise the holes produced by the oxygen vacancies, as shown in. The incorporation of a moderate quantity of NbE^{5+} facilitates a reduction in the concentration of oxygen vacancies and an enhancement in the resistivity of BTW ceramics, which helps to solve the problem of low piezoelectric performance of the BTW ceramics due to the difficulty of sufficient polarization. The conductivity activation energy (E a) of the ceramic is in accordance with Arrhenius' theorem, as demonstrated by the following : where A is the pre-factor and k is the Boltzmann constant. b\u2013f shows a plot of ln\u03c1 versus 1000/T, fitted to the activation energy E a. In the low-temperature part, the activation energy E a values of the components are 0.47 eV to 0.67 eV. This is comparable to the second-order ionization energy of oxygen vacancies, which is estimated to be between 0.6 eV and 1.2 eV. However, in the high-temperature part, the activation energy is between 1.61 eV and 1.81 eV, which is close to half of the band gap. Consequently, at elevated temperatures, the intrinsic conduction mechanism is the dominant factor in the conduction process. illustrates the complex impedance spectrum of the BTW-xNb ceramic sample across a temperature range of 520\u2013600\xb0C. The test data were fitted by a simplified R-C-CRE parallel equivalent circuit using the Z-View program. The observation of two Cole-Cole semicircles in a and only one Cole-Cole semicircle in b\u2013e indicates that the contribution to the impedance of the pure BTW ceramic is the grains and grain boundaries, whereas the main contribution to the impedance of the ceramic after doping with NbE^{5+} ions is the grains. The value of the curve intersecting the (Z\u2032) axis in the figure represents the total complex impedance value. It can be observed that as the temperature decreases, the impedance value increases, indicating a typical negative impedance effect (NTCR). Furthermore, with the increase in NbE^{5+} doping, the impedance value shows a pattern of increasing then decreasing. This suggests that the appropriate amount of NbE^{5+} ion doping can enhance the impedance of BTW ceramics, with a analogous to that observed in DC resistance. The upper-right insets in a\u2013e illustrate the plots of the conductivity of the corresponding components, taken logarithmically with respect to 1000/T, within the temperature range of 520\u2013600\u2103. The activation energies of the components were calculated in accordance with the Arrhenius equation, which states that \u03c3 = \u03c3 0exp(-E/kB T). The activation energies of all samples ranged from 0.90 to 1.26 eV. The threshold for the involvement of oxygen vacancies in the conductance is approximately 1 eV , so there may be oxygen vacancies involved in conductance. The activation energy increases gradually with the increase of NbE^{5+} ion doping. The replacement of TiE^{4+} with NbE^{5+} effectively diminishes the oxygen vacancy concentration and significantly improves the high temperature impedance. a illustrates \u03b5 r and tan \u03b4 as a function of temperature for BTW-xNb ceramic at a frequency of 1 MHz. The Curie temperature T C of pure BTW ceramics is 730\xb0C, which is consistent with the direct transition of the Aurivilius phase Bi3Ti1.5W0.5O9 from the space group A21 am to I4/mmm at 735\xb0C, as demonstrated by Neil C. The initial increase in the pure system at the doping amount of NbE^{5+} ions (x = 0.04) from 730 \xb0C to 750 \xb0C indicates that NbE^{5+} ion doping significantly increases the T C of BTW ceramics. This may be attributed to the higher electronegativity of the NbE^{5+} ions compared to that of TiE^{4+}, and the increase in the radius of the B-site ions after the substitution of NbE^{5+} (0.064 nm, 6 CN) for TiE^{4+} (0.0605 nm, 6 CN). The substitution of TiE^{4+} results in an increase in the B-site ion radius, which subsequently leads to a decrease in the tolerance factor t. The dielectric constant exhibits relatively stable behaviour prior to 500\xb0C, as evidenced by the dielectric temperature spectrum. In this context, the temperature stability coefficient of the dielectric constant (Tk \u03b5 ) is introduced as a means of investigating the stability of the dielectric constant. The following equation is employed: Where \u03b5 T and \u03b5 T0 are the dielectric constants at temperature T and room temperature T 0, respectively , and b the Tk \u03b5 variation plot for BTW-xNb ceramics. As illustrated in the curves, the Tk \u03b5 of each sample exhibits a slight increase with rising temperature. At a temperature of 500 \xb0C, the Tk \u03b5 remains below 1.50 \xd7 10E^{\u22123} \xb0CE^{\u22121}, suggesting that the moderate doping of the BTW-xNb ceramics has the potential for dielectric service at high temperatures. c shows the dielectric peaks of the BTW-xNb ceramic at varying frequencies. The degree of BTW dispersion was investigated using the Curie-Weiss formula: where \u03b5 r is the relative permittivity at T, \u03b5 m is the relative permittivity at T m (i.e., T C ), and C is a constant. The dispersion factor, \u03b3, has a value between 1 and 2. depicts the plot of ln(1/\u03b5-1/\u03b5 m ) versus ln(T-T C ) at 100 kHz, which is in accordance with the corresponding \u03b3. The value of the dispersion factor \u03b3 gradually increases from 1.15 to 1.39, indicating that the degree of dispersion of this material becomes larger with the increase of NbE^{5+} ion doping. According to the Smolensky compositional fluctuation theory, this may be attributed to the inhomogeneous behaviour of the lattice and composition following B-site doping with NbE^{5+}. Furthermore, all ceramic samples exhibit a low level of dielectric loss up to 400 \xb0C. However, dielectric loss increases after the Curie temperature T C. d illustrates the tan \u03b4 and its ratio to tan \u03b4 (RT) at 500 \xb0C for all components. The tan \u03b4 decreases from 21.1 % (undoped) to 8.2 % (BTW-0.02 Nb), and tan \u03b4/tan \u03b4 (RT) also decreases at 500 \xb0C, indicating that doping NbE^{5+} optimises the tan \u03b4 of the BTW. This may be attributed to the fact that the substitution of NbE^{5+} in place of TiE^{4+} produces electrons which neutralise holes produced by oxygen vacancies, thus increasing the resistivity of the ceramic sample and reducing the losses. a\u2013e shows the P-E and I-E curves of BTW-xNb ceramics at 10 Hz and 160\xb0C. In order to observe more visually the evolution of ferroelectric properties, f presents the trend plots of the coercive electric field (2E c) and the remanent polarization (2P r ) for each component. As the degree of doping increases, the value of P r initially rises, reaches a maximum value at x = 0.02, and then declines. The piezoelectric equation (d = 2\u03b5P r Q ) indicates that high P r values result in elevated piezoelectric coefficients (d 33) in BTW-0.02 Nb, which is consistent with the d 33 law. The remanent polarization intensity (P r ) increases from 4.95 \u03bcC/cm\xb2 (pure system) to 10 \u03bcC/cm\xb2 (BTW \u22120.02 Nb). The improvement of P r in this experiment is attributed to the reduced concentration of oxygen vacancies in the NbE^{5+} doped ceramics, which attenuates the pinning effect of the domains and inhibits the interactions between the domain walls and the oxygen vacancies, leading to a higher degree of domain flipping at the same electric field. It is worthy of note that the P-E return line in is asymmetric (E c+ \u2260 E c-). This is due to the influence of internal bias fields within the material. a illustrates the d 33 of the BTW-xNb ceramic following polarization. With increasing NbE^{5+} doping, the d 33 value reaches a maximum of approximately 13 pC/N at doping level x = 0.02 (about twice undoped) and then subsequently decreases. The analysis of XRD refinement results concludes the successful synthesis of BTW-based ceramics (no second phase generation), and the reduction of the O-Ti-O angle in the oxygen octahedron provides more space for the movement of the B-site ions in the oxygen octahedron, which facilitates the piezoelectric properties. In the case of XPS and resistivity, it is shown that Nb ion doping decreases the concentration of oxygen vacancies in the ceramics and greatly increases the resistivity of the ceramics (8.24\xd710E^{6}\u03a9\xb7cm at 500 \u2103). It is observed from the hysteresis return line that the hysteresis return line is fuller at x=0.02, indicating that Nb doping can effectively enhance the switching of ferroelectric domains in the BTW-based ceramics, which is beneficial to the piezoelectric performance. In addition, the trend of the residual polarization strength (P r ) is the same as that of the piezoelectric constant (d 33). The two, P r and d 33, are tightly correlated, and the increase of P r is beneficial to the enhancement of d 33. Furthermore, it has been observed that excessive Nb doping results in a reduction in d 33. This may be attributed to a decline in resistivity and an increase in dielectric loss, which ultimately leads to a ceramic that is not adequately polarised. b illustrates the d 33 versus depolarization temperature curves for the BTW-xNb ceramic, which were maintained at each temperature point for 30 min and allowed to naturally cool to room temperature. It can be observed that the variation of d 33 with temperature is minimal within the range of room temperature to 700 \xb0C. The ceramic with x = 0.02 demonstrates excellent temperature stability, exhibiting a decrease in d 33 of only 13.84 % at 700 \xb0C in comparison to room temperature. c presents a comparative analysis of the properties of BTW-0.00 Nb and BTW-0.02 Nb ceramics. All properties of the BTW-0.02 Nb sample exhibit marked improvement in comparison to those of the BTW-0.00 Nb sample. Among the observed changes, the d 33, P r , and \u03c1 dc exhibited notable increases, from 7.5 pC/N, 4.95 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, and 9.16 \xd7 10E^{5} \u03a9\xb7cm (500 \xb0C) to 13 pC/N, 10 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, and 8.24 \xd7 10E^{6} \u03a9\xb7cm (500 \xb0C), respectively. Furthermore, the tan\u03b4 value decreased from 21.1 % to 8.2 % (500 \xb0C). In conclusion, the BTW-0.02 Nb ceramic have the potential to be utilised in applications at high temperatures.
