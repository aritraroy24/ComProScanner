To calculate the piezoelectric coefficients e i j k measured in different units for planar and bulk materials, we use inverse piezoelectric effect given by the formula  where \u03c3 j k is the mechanical stress tensor determined as the force per unit length in the direction perpendicular to the force and E i is the component of the external electric field. In this way, we obtain the ion-clamped piezoelectric tensor of Moir\xe9 BNn, AlNn, and GaNn bilayers with the twisted angle of 27.8\xb0. Our DFT calculations, which derive the ion-relaxed piezoelectric tensor, exactly meet this condition. Bulk piezoelectric crystals are characterized, in general, by 4 different piezoelectric constant tensors. For considered bilayers, the following relationships apply between e i j k and d i j k (the same convolution rule applies here):  In the last expression, the component of the elastic moduli tensor c33 in expanded form is represented as c1212. The calculated piezoelectric characteristics of the Moir\xe9 AlNn, BNn, and GaNn nitridanes as compared to other 2D and bulk piezoelectric materials are listed in. The empty cells in the last column \u201c Refs. \u201d correspond to our calculation in this paper. In addition to the elastic and piezoelectric constants, includes the cohesive energy calculated as E coh= \u2211 E free-\u2211 E totN, where Efree is the energy of free atoms, Etot is the full energy of the relaxed cell, and N is number of atoms in the cell. In the energetic sense the most stable are the fluorinated Moir\xe9 nitridanes. However, even their cohesive energies are separated from the corresponding value of monolayer boron nitride (h-BN) by a large gap. The energy stability of Moir\xe9 nitridanes with the twisted angle of 27.8\xb0 deteriorates in the series: boron nitridanes \u2192 aluminum nitridanes \u2192 gallium nitridanes. Boron nitride Moir\xe9 bilayers with the twisted angle of 27.8\xb0 are more energetically stable than similar bilayers with the twisted angle of 21.8\xb0. To insight into mechanical stability, we used the well-known Born-Huang criterion , which for the hexagonal lattice types has the following form: c11- c12>0 and c11+2 c12>0. From it follows that for all considered Moir\xe9 nitridane bilayers the mechanical stability criterion is satisfied. There is a correlation between boron nitridanes twisted at different angles: hydrogenated and fluorinated nitridanes with the twisted angles of 21.8\xb0 and 27.8\xb0 have close e 22, while the ratios of e 22 of fluorinated boron nitridanes (F-BNn21.8 and F-BNn27.8) to hydrogenated ones (BNn21.8 and BNn27.8) for both cases are approximately two. Moreover, despite the fact that the presented Moir\xe9 nitridanes are bilayer films, polarizations from adjacent layers do not cancel each other out, as happens in van der Waals multilayer heterostructures with an even number of layers. The calculation method was tested for compliance with experimental data for both bulk and 2D piezoelectric materials. Agreement with experimental data for 2D materials (using h-BN as an example) is also given in. The agreement between the results of the calculation method and classical piezoelectric materials was based on a comparison with the cubic phase of bulk boron nitride: Ref. gives the data range for the e 14 constants. It ranges from 0.20 to 3.34 C/mE^{2}. Our calculation (1.03 C/mE^{2}) falls within this interval. Also, excellent agreement is observed between our calculations and the Ref. , where the calculated value of the same component, but under unclamped crystal conditions, is 0.89 C/mE^{2} against our value of 0.87 C/mE^{2}. Hydrogenated or fluorinated Moir\xe9 boron nitridanes with the twisted angle of 21.8\xb0 have the same piezoelectric response in the direction normal to the nanosheet, i.e. described by the e 31 piezoelectric coefficient, as potassium- or lithium-doped graphene. The measured in-plane piezoelectric constant in the twisted graphene was 0.15 pm/V , which is close to d 22 of the AA\u2019-BNn structure (see ). The in-plane piezoelectric moduli of all the considered Moir\xe9 nitradane bilayers are higher. In the case of Moir\xe9 bilayers , it is clear that not all bonds of the \u201cboron\u2013adatom\u201d and \u201cnitrogen\u2013adatom\u201d types are perpendicular to the bilayer plane, which, on average, leads to a decrease in the lengths of the dipoles. However, as a computational experiment has shown, due to various passivation, the piezoelectric constant e 33 becomes non-zero. When compared with other bilayer materials, the piezoelectric response in this Moir\xe9 nitridane bilayers is stronger. Analysis of the formation energy of 2D and bulk materials shown that fluorinated structures based on graphene, AB, AA\u2019, Moir\xe9 diamanes and nitridanes are energetically more preferable, while hydrogenated structures are less energetically favorable. The piezoelectric effect in the vertical direction relative to the nanosheet, which is necessary for the excitation of flexural elastic waves , requires non-zero coefficients e 31 and e 33 ( d 31 and d 33 ). We see that the Moir\xe9 nitridanes can be used for these purposes. Moreover, due to the specifically close values of the elastic moduli tensor components c11 and c12 in F-AlNn27.8, H/F-AlNn27.8 and F-GaNn27.8, structures, the piezo moduli d11 and d33 are large. As can be seen from the data in the , in the Moir\xe9 bornitridanes with the twisted angle of 27.8\xb0 and in Moir\xe9 gallium nitridanes with the twisted angle of 21.8\xb0, the values of piezoelectric constants and piezoelectric moduli are higher than the corresponding values for untwisted nitridanes.
