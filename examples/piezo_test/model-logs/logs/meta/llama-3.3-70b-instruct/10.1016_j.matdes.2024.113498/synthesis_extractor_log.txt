Bi2O3 (99.9 %), TiO2 (99.8 %), Na2CO3 (99.6 %), MnO2 (99 %), BaCO3 (99.8 %), Fe2O3 (99.945 %) (all from Sigma-Aldrich) were used as starting materials. The raw powders were weighed according to the stoichiometric formulae and then thoroughly ball milled for 24 h in polypropylene containers with ethanol and ZrO2 balls using a planetary milling machine (QM-3SP4, Nanjing University Instrument Plant, China). The first calcination process was carried out 850\xb0C for 2 h to prevent the volatilization of BiE^{3+}. Then, the second cycle was conducted at 900\xb0C for 4 h. The calcined powder was then re-milled for 24 h, and thermally treated again in an additional two-stage calcination process at 950\xb0C for 4 h, followed by calcination at 1000\xb0C for 2 h. The obtained powder was then milled again for 4 h to homogeneously reduce the particle size. Subsequently, the powder was mixed with a binder (5 wt% polyvinyl alcohol) in a mortar and then uniaxial cold-pressed into pellets with a diameter of 12 mm. The pellets were covered with powder of the same composition and sintered at 1100 \xb0C for 2 h in sealed alumina crucibles. The calcination and sintering processes were performed at a heating rate of 5\xb0C/min. The drying procedures were carried out at 120\xb0C on a hot plate for 12 h. The effective relative density of the ceramics, as measured by the Archimedes method was found to be about 97.7 %. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out with an X-ray diffractometer (Panalytical Xpert Pro diffractometer using CuK\u03b1 radiation). The XRD data obtained on powders thoroughly ground from pellets were analysed by the Rietveld method using the GSAS program. The microstructure of the ceramics was observed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (FEI Inspect-F, Oxford). The morphology of the ferroelectric domains was imaged at room temperature by a piezoresponse force microscope equipped with a magnetic field generator (NT-MDT, Ntegra systems, Russia) at 70 kHz and a 10 V AC voltage. The sample stage in the PFM unit was kept at the same position and the scanning parameters remained unchanged before and after poling to ensure that the same sample\u2019s area was scanned. All the samples for SEM and PFM observations were mirror-polished and then etched at 900 \xb0C for 20 mins to visualize the grain boundaries. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were acquired using a bespoke ultra-high vacuum system equipped with a Specs GmbH Focus 500 monochromatic Al K\u03b1 X-ray source, Specs GmbH Phoibos 150 mm mean radius hemispherical analyser with 9-channeltron detection, and a Specs GmbH FG20 charge neutralising electron gun.The XPS spectra were acquired over the binding energy range 1100 \u2013 0 eV using a pass energy of 50 eV and high-resolution scans were made over the C 1 s, O 1 s, Mn 2p and Fe 2p lines using a pass energy of 15 eV with the medium area lens mode, 7 mm diameter input aperture and 30 mm diameter lens (Iris diaphragm).Under these conditions, the full width at half maximum of the Ag 3d5/2 reference line is \u223c 0.7 eV.The analysis was performed for an area-average over a region of approximately 2 mm in diameter on the sample surface. The energy scale of the instrument was calibrated according to ISO standard 15472, and the intensity scale was calibrated using an in-house method traceable to the UK National Physical Laboratory. Data were quantified using Scofield cross sectioncorrected for the energy dependencies of the electron attenuation lengths and the instrument transmission.Data interpretation was carried out using CasaXPS software v2.3.16 (Casa Software Ltd, UK). The temperature (300 K to 970 K) and frequency (1 kHz to 1 MHz) dependencies of the relative dielectric permittivity and loss was measured using an LCR meter (Agilent, 4284A, USA) and a purpose-designed heating furnace with a low temperature cooling system. The frequency dependence of the relative dielectric permittivity and loss at room temperature was measured in the range (40 Hz-300 kHz) using an LCR meter (Agilent, 4284A, USA). For the dielectric tests the surfaces of the pellets were uniformly coated by silver paste at a firing temperature of 600 \xb0C. The piezoelectric constant, d 33, was measured using a Berlincourt meter (ZJ-3B, Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academic of Science, Beijing). The polarization-current-electric field (P-I-E) hysteresis loops (at 60 kV/cm amplitude and 10 Hz frequency) were generated in silicon oil at room temperature using a ferroelectric tester (NPL, Teddington, UK). The samples for P-I-E and d 33 tests were poled in silicon oil at 120\u2103 for 30 min under an electric field of 35 kV/cm. A superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum Design, a model MPMS VSM) was used to measure the magnetization-magnetic field (M\u2212H) hysteresis loops at 10 K, 20 K, 30 K and 285 K. In the M\u2212H loops, the paramagnetic contribution has been subtracted. The coaxial method was employed to measure the complex permittivity and complex permeability in the frequency range of 2\u201318 GHz with a vector network analyser (VNA, N5247A). For the measurement, the ceramic was crushed and mixed with Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA). The mixed powder was shaped into a toroid sample whose inner diameter, outer diameter, and thickness were 3 mm, 7 mm, and 2 mm, respectively.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a) shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the BNT-6BT-5BFO2M crushed ceramic. The XRD data was refined by GSAS software showing a single phase with a tetragonal symmetry of P4mm space group. The phase matching carried out indicates that the tiny peak marked by the red asterisk belongs to ZrO2 (see inset of (a)). The presence of ZrO2 probably comes from the milling media used in the ball milling step. Pure ZrO2 is non-magnetic, but in presence of defects it can exhibit magnetic activity. However, based on previous studies on related materials, in which ZrO2 was not detected as impurity, while the samples still showed ferromagnetism , it can be possibly inferred that it is not the presence of ZrO2 to induce ferromagnetic behaviour in the present composition. (b) shows the scanning electron microscope image of BNT-6BT-5BFO2M ceramics, evidencing grains with an average grain size estimated as 2.32 \u03bcm, using the Image J software. displays the temperature (300 K to 870 K) and frequency dependence of the dielectric permittivity ((a1)) and loss ( (a2)). The dielectric permittivity presents a frequency-independent anomaly at around 720 K (black dotted lines in (a1) and red circle in the relative in-set), which is also visible in the loss curves at low frequencies. As reported in previous studies on BFO-based ceramics , anomalies in the dielectric permittivity in the range 530 K-720 K could be ascribed to the antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition, the so-called N\xe9el temperature. The anomalies in permittivity and loss between 300 K and 500 K may be ascribed to the effect of oxygen vacancies, as supported by the XPS results in. In unmodified BFO, these features are commonly observed above 800 K; however, their position shifts towards lower temperature after Ba and Ti ions substitution. (b1)\u2013(e2) presents the PFM data before poling (b1 \u2212 topography, c1 \u2212 phase, d1 \u2212 amplitude and e1 \u2212 line profile along the blue line marked in (b)) and after poling (the respective images b2, c2, d2 and e2). The point poling was carried out by applying a DC field of + 30 V in the specific area marked by the encircled red cross in (b1-d1) and (b2-d2). (c1, d1) and (c2, d2) show distinct changes in the PFM amplitude and phase, suggesting a domain reorientation after poling. The amplitude and phase profiles along the blue line in (b1) and 2(b2), as recorded before and after poling, are shown in the respective (e1) and (e2). The apparent variations in the PFM amplitude and phase values within the poling area indicate the occurrence of field-induced domain switching. It can be noticed that the amplitude and phase signals show no reversal in the area where no electric field was applied ((e1) and (e2)), denoting that domains are locally tunable by the applied electric field. By applying the AC electric field from \u22120.8 V to + 0.8 V at room temperature using the PFM tip, a slim phase vs bias hysteresis loop was generated (cf. c). The classical ferroelectric P-E hysteresis loop obtained at room temperature and 60 kV/cm shows a maximum polarization Pmax \u2248 6 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} and a remnant polarization Pr \u2248 0.6 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} (e). The piezoelectric coefficient d33 = 27.6 pC/N of the poled sample unambiguously proves domains alignment induced by the applied electric field during poling, and hence ferroelectricity , in the BNT-6BT-5BFO2M system. f shows the frequency dependence of the dielectric permittivity and loss at room temperature. The tan\u03b4 and dielectric permittivity of ceramic disk in the low frequency range from 40 Hz to 5 kHz were also calculated as 0.18 and 870, respectively, by using impedance-phase angle data (f). shows the fitted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data of BNT-6BT-5BFO2M ceramics relative to O 1 s, Bi 4f, Ba 3d, Ti 2p, Mn 2p and Fe 2p, calibrated with the C 1 s line (284.8 eV) binding energy. (a) shows the high-resolution core spectrum of O 1 s. The three peaks located at 529.5 eV, 530.3 eV and 531.9 eV are commonly ascribed to oxygen-metal bonds, oxygen vacancies and absorbed oxygen, respectively, in the available literature (see for instance Ref. among others). (b) shows the high-resolution core spectrum of Bi 4f. The two strong peaks located at 164.1 eV and 158.8 eV correspond to Bi 4f5/2 and Bi 4f7/2; the binding energy span of 5.30 eV between these two peaks indicates that the bismuth element is stable in the 3 + valence state. The high-resolution core spectrum of Ba 5d is shown in (c). The binding energy peak of Ba 5d5/2 falls at 778.8 eV, indicating that Ba ions are present in the 2 + valence state. The deconvolution of the peak in the spectrum of Mn 2p3/2 reveals the presence of two underlying peaks located at 641.6 eV and 642.7 eV ((d)), which implies that the Mn ions are in the oxidation states of 3 + and 4+, corresponding to the respective peaks. (e) shows the high-resolution core spectra of Fe 2p. The binding energy corresponding to the Fe 2p3/2 main peak is 710.3 eV with a satellite peak at 718.9 eV, reflecting the 3 + valence state for the Fe ions in BNT-6BT-5BFO2M. The presence of peaks at 457.6 eV in the Ti 2p XPS spectrum shown in (f) is consistent with the Ti 2p spectra reported for other perovskite titanates. However, the exact identification of the Ti valence state remains challenging as the the Ti 2p1/2 peak usually located in the binding energy range 461\u2013465 eV is superimposed by the much larger Bi 4d3/2 peak. The peak in the Ti 2p spectrum around 457.6 eV (the Ti 2p3/2 peak) could be well-fitted by a single peak; however, the peak\u2019s asymmetry supports the presence of TiE^{4+} and TiE^{3+} ions. The presence of oxygen vacancies could be ascribed to the requirement to maintain charge neutrality in presence of Ti ions in the valence state 3+, when Mn partially substitutes Fe at the B-site, and to balance possible deficiency of volatile elements that might evaporate during the calcination and sintering processes. shows the dependence of the magnetization (M) on the magnetic field (H) for BNT-6BT-5BFO2M at 10 K, 20 K, 30 K ((a)) and 285 K ((b)). The paramagnetic background of the substrate has been subtracted from the recorded M\u2212H loops. The room-temperature ferromagnetic nature is evidenced by the well-saturated M\u2212H loops with a remnant magnetization of about 0.01 emu/g and symmetric coercive fields (cf. ). As indicated in , the Ba, Bi, Fe, Mn and Ti ions in BNT-6BT-5BFO2M have 2+, 3+, 3+, 3+/4 + and 3+/4 + valence state, respectively. The stoichiometry is possibly balanced by TiE^{3+}, MnE^{4+} and oxygen vacancies; therefore, the composition quoted represents the nominal stoichiometry. The spontaneous magnetization of BNT-6BT-5BFO2M is affected by the presence of MnE^{4+} ions, similarly to the ferromagnetism in Mn-doped Aurivillius phase multiferroics. The substituted Mn ions in BFO are expected to not only introduce FeE^{3+}-O-MnE^{4+} bonds with ferromagnetic double-exchange interactions (cf. ), but also to distort the antiferromagnetic cycloid ordering, contributing to the net ferromagnetic moment at room temperature. The double-exchange interaction is mediated by (real) electron transfers between the half-filled eg orbitals of FeE^{3+} and the two empty MnE^{4+} eg orbitals. Apart from the double-exchange, the oxygen vacancies could also contribute to the net magnetic moment through the F-centres via the exchange effect, as shown in (c) and (d). shows the magnetic field-induced ferroelectric domain switching driven by a magnetic field and captured using PFM. The out-of-plane polarization is recorded without ((a) topography, 5(c) phase) and with ((b) topography, 5(d) phase) an applied magnetic field (+2000 Oe, in plane) at room temperature. Under the applied magnetic field of 2000 Oe, some of the in-plane domains reorient towards the out-of-plane direction (see (c) and (d)). This behaviour provides the evidence that the ferroelectric polarization of BNT-6BT-5BFO2M ceramics can be tuned by a magnetic field at room temperature. shows the resonance magnetoelectric dynamics induced in the GHz. Around 11.65 and 15.76 GHz, the complex dielectric permittivity (\u03b5=\u03b5\u2032+i\u03b5\u2033) and complex magnetic permeability (\u03bc=\u03bc\u2032+i\u03bc\u2033) both exhibit resonant behaviour. The ME coupling effect can be attributed to the stereo-chemical activity of 6 sE^{2} lone pair electrons of BiE^{3+} in BNT-6BT and BFO that would contribute to the B-site ions displacement and further affect the magnetic spin order also through the FeE^{3+}-O-MnE^{4+} bonds. The resonance peaks in the imaginary component of the permittivity \u03b5\u2033 in the GHz region can be ascribed to the effects of polarization induced by intrinsic and defect dipoles mediated by the presence of oxygen vacancies. The local dip in the imaginary permeability (\u03bc\u2033), related to an absorptive change of the precession damping of magnetic dipoles, occur at the same frequency of the resonance features in the dielectric properties, possibly indicating an intrinsic magnetoelectric coupling between spontaneous polarization and magnetic dipoles.

Apart from the double-exchange, the oxygen vacancies could also contribute to the net magnetic moment through the F-centres via the exchange effect, as shown in (c) and (d). shows the magnetic field-induced ferroelectric domain switching driven by a magnetic field and captured using PFM. The out-of-plane polarization is recorded without ((a) topography, 5(c) phase) and with ((b) topography, 5(d) phase) an applied magnetic field (+2000 Oe, in plane) at room temperature. Under the applied magnetic field of 2000 Oe, some of the in-plane domains reorient towards the out-of-plane direction (see (c) and (d)). This behaviour provides the evidence that the ferroelectric polarization of BNT-6BT-5BFO2M ceramics can be tuned by a magnetic field at room temperature. shows the resonance magnetoelectric dynamics induced in the GHz. Around 11.65 and 15.76 GHz, the complex dielectric permittivity (\u03b5=\u03b5\u2032+i\u03b5\u2033) and complex magnetic permeability (\u03bc=\u03bc\u2032+i\u03bc\u2033) both exhibit resonant behaviour. The ME coupling effect can be attributed to the stereo-chemical activity of 6 sE^{2} lone pair electrons of BiE^{3+} in BNT-6BT and BFO that would contribute to the B-site ions displacement and further affect the magnetic spin order also through the FeE^{3+}-O-MnE^{4+} bonds. The resonance peaks in the imaginary component of the permittivity \u03b5\u2033 in the GHz region can be ascribed to the effects of polarization induced by intrinsic and defect dipoles mediated by the presence of oxygen vacancies. The local dip in the imaginary permeability (\u03bc\u2033), related to an absorptive change of the precession damping of magnetic dipoles, occur at the same frequency of the resonance features in the dielectric properties, possibly indicating an intrinsic magnetoelectric coupling between spontaneous polarization and magnetic dipoles.
**Notes**:
- For precursors, just use the chemical name (no company or purity) and for characterization_techniques, only the instrument name or short name of the instrument for the instruments like XRD, Raman Spectroscopy, SEM, TEM etc.
- For synthesis_methods, use the short name of the method if possible, else write the full name and don't use method/reaction word at the end.
- For precursors, just use the chemical composition (if available) else chemical name (no company or purity)
- For characterization_techniques, try using short name of the characterization techniques like XRD, Raman Spectroscopy, SEM, TEM etc. if possible, else write the full name.
