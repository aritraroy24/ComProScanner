# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Room-temperature XRD patterns of both CBNO and CLCBN-100xWM ceramics are presented in (a1), all reflection peaks match the CBNO standard card (PDF # 49\u20130608, A21 am space group), without second phase material being generated. This suggests that Li, Ce, W, and Mo can be incorporated into the CBNO lattice, forming a solid solution within the designed doping range. The (115) reflection exhibits the highest intensity, this is consistent with the strongest reflection of (112 n+1) in BLSF ceramics. The detailed contours near 29.0\xb0 and 29.5\xb0 are illustrated in (a2). Notably, the reflection of (115) gradually shifts to a higher angle with increasing W/Mo doping, attributed to the replacement of larger NbE^{5+} ion (0.64 \xc5, CN = 6) by small WE^{6+} ion (0.60 \xc5, CN = 6) and MoE^{6+} ion (0.59 \xc5, CN = 6), leading to unit cell contraction. Additionally, the distance between the (200) and (020) reflections is close to zero with increased W/Mo doping, as displayed in (a3). The reflections (200) and (020) merge into a single peak at doping levels greater than 0.03, indicating an evolution of the crystal structure of the ceramic from the orthorhombic phase to a pseudo-tetragonal phase. This suggests a pseudo-tetragonal phase boundary near x = 0.03, aligning with previously reported findings for CBNO-based piezoelectric ceramics. To further analyze the crystal structure evolution of CLCBN-100xWM ceramics, we performed Rietveld refinement on the collected powder XRD data based on the structural model (space group: A21 am) reported by Blake et al. , as shown in and. The calculated patterns correspond well with the experimental values, exhibiting reasonable \u03c7 E^{2}, R p, and R wp values. The a/b value decreases from 1.00539 to 1.00395 with increasing doping in CLCBN-100xWM ceramics, indicating a gradual deviation of the crystal structure from the orthorhombic phase and a trend toward a pseudo-tetragonal phase with higher symmetry. (b) presents the crystal structure diagram of CLCBN-3WM ceramics. The refined atomic occupancy indicates cation disorder between the (CaNb2O7)E^{2-} layer and the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layer. The occupancy of Ca in the perovskite A site and the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layer is 0.795(7) and 0.125(7), respectively. Similarly, the occupancy of Bi in the perovskite A site and the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layer is 0.053(2) and 0.947(2), respectively. The degrees of tilt and rotation of the [NbO6] octahedron are represented by \u03b1 (the angle between O1-O2 and the c-axis) and \u03b2 (\u2220O4-O4-O4), respectively. The values of \u03b1 and \u03b2 for all samples were calculated based on atomic occupancies obtained from Rietveld refinement, as illustrated in (c1). It is observed that as the doping amount increases, both \u03b1 and \u03b2 gradually increase. Specifically, the variation of \u03b1 is significantly greater than that of \u03b2, as shown in (c2), indicating that the rotation of the [NbO6] octahedron has a more significant effect on the spontaneous polarization intensity in CLCBN-100xWM ceramics. This model is based on the atomic coordinates finely adjusted by the Rietveld method, as listed in. where m i represents the site multiplicity, \u0394x i is the displacement of the atom along the a-axis from its corresponding position in the parent structure, Q i e is the charge carried by the ion, and V represents the volume of a unit cell. The atomic displacement and contribution to P s of each constituent element of CLCBN and CLCBN-3WM ceramics are illustrated in (d). CLCBN-3WM ceramics exhibit a large P s (31.74 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}), which is primarily attributed to the larger atomic displacement of O5. The P s of CLCBN-100xWM ceramics are larger than that of CBNO, which may be due to the increase in lattice distortion caused by the higher doping amount, thus further affecting P s. For x > 0.03 components, P s shows a downward trend, possibly due to the excessive deviation of the ceramic crystal structure from the parent phase, which increases the tetragonality and results in a decrease in P s. All samples exhibit Raman vibration modes consistent with the orthorhombic phase structure within the tested range (20\u20131000 cmE^{\u22121}). Notably, strong phonon vibration modes are observed at approximately 36.5, 55.7, 179.2, 201.3, 583.6, and 815.2 cmE^{\u22121}, denoted as v1-v6, respectively. Generally, the low-wavenumber vibration mode below 200 cmE^{\u22121} is primarily associated with the A site ions in the perovskite structure, while the high-wavenumber vibration above 200 cmE^{\u22121} is attributed to the [NbO6] octahedron. By employing the Lorentz function decomposition of the Raman vibration modes, it is possible to extract 16 independent vibration modes. illustrates the v1-v6 Raman peaks in CLCBN-100xWM ceramics. Among these peaks, v1-v3 are associated with A site CaE^{2+} ions, and v1 and v3 almost do not shift with the increase in doping amount, while v2 experiences a decrease in wavenumber compared to CBNO, attributed to the substitution of LiE^{+} and CeE^{3+} for CaE^{2+}, altering the original CaE^{2+} ion vibration. The v4 peak reflects the degree of distortion in the [NbO6] octahedron. v5 and v6 represent the asymmetric and symmetric vibrations of the [NbO6] octahedron, respectively. In CLCBN-100xWM ceramics, both v5 and v6 show a shift towards lower wavenumbers compared to CBNO. This can be attributed to the rotation and tilt of the octahedron caused by the doping of W/Mo composite ions at the B site, resulting in localized lattice structure distortion. (a-h) presents the surface morphology of CBNO and CLCBN-100xWM ceramics. The average grain size decreases significantly from 7.06 \u03bcm (length) to 4.61 \u03bcm (length) after doping with Li/Ce at the A site. The growth of CLCBN-100xWM ceramic grains in the a-b direction is inhibited, and the grains transform from rod-like structures to block-like forms. The average grain size decreases gradually from 4.61 \u03bcm (length) to 3.66 \u03bcm (length) with the increase of W/Mo co-doping, accompanied by a gradual reduction in the aspect ratio (length/width, as shown in ). This phenomenon may be attributed to the decreased of oxygen vacancy concentration in CLCBN-100xWM ceramics (as discussed later), which impedes ion diffusion during the densification process, thereby slowing both grain and grain boundary diffusion rates and inhibiting overall grain growth. Notably, the microstructure of CLCBN-6WM ceramics includes a small number of abnormal diamond-shaped grains alongside block and elongated strip grains. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping  reveals that the diamond-shaped grains in CLCBN-6WM ceramics are enriched with Ca, W, and Mo elements. In addition, we synthesized a sample with x = 0.07 for XRD analysis and found the formation of impurity phases, as shown in. It can be inferred that the solid solution limit of W and Mo in the CLCBN-100xWM system is approximately x = 0.06. The domain structure of the CLCBN-3WM ceramic sample was further elucidated through TEM images, as depicted in (j). The images reveal a rich nano-scale 180\xb0 domain structure with a width of approximately 6 nm. Previous studies on CBNO ceramics using PFM amplitude imaging showed with a width of around 200 nm. The reduction in domain size and increase in domain wall density are beneficial for enhancing the piezoelectric properties and temperature stability of CBNO-based piezoelectric ceramics. (k) presents HR-TEM images of CLCBN-3WM ceramics, revealing periodic stripes associated with the bismuth oxide layer and [NbO6] layer. The measured distance between adjacent stripes is approximately 1.24 nm, which is about half of the lattice parameter c of CLCBN-3WM ceramic (c = 2.48619 nm, as shown in ). (l) displays the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) images of CLCBNO-3WM ceramics along the [011] axis. Weak (hk0) and (h00) type superlattice reflections are observed in the images, a phenomenon previously reported by Pan et al.. Additionally, a similar superlattice phenomenon has been noted in SrBi2Nb2O9 ceramics. The frequency dependence of the dielectric permittivity (\u03b5\u2032) and dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) for CBNO and CLCBN-100xWM ceramics is shown in. After polarization by a DC electric field, the dielectric permittivity of all samples decreases, which may be due to a reduction in non-180\xb0 domain wall density or changes in domain structure. The resonance and anti-resonance peaks observed at high frequencies in the polarized samples can be attributed to the piezoelectric effect. illustrates the composition dependence of the dielectric permittivity and dielectric loss for all samples at 100 kHz. However, after DC polarization, the dielectric loss of the CLCBN-100xWM ceramic sample increases, which can be attributed to changes in dielectric loss caused by the movement and rearrangement of the domain wall under the electric field. The temperature dependence of the dielectric permittivity and dielectric loss of all samples at 1 MHz is shown in (a-b). As the doping content increases, the T C of the sample decreases from 940 \xb0C to 914 \xb0C, which may be attributed to the enhanced tetragonality of the ceramic crystal structure and a reduced energy barrier for phase transition due to the increased doping content. In CLCBN-100xWM ceramics, the position of Nb is replaced by W/Mo with smaller ionic radii. Additionally, the trend in T C corresponds with the orthorhombicity parameter 2(a-b)/(a+b), indicating that T C is influenced by the degree of crystal distortion. The ferroelectric hysteresis loops (P-E) and current density curves (J-E) of CBNO and CLCBN-100xWM ceramics, as illustrated in (a-h). The J-E curves of CLCBN-100xWM ceramic samples show pronounced current peaks. CLCBN-3WM demonstrates the most standard P-E loops. In contrast, the P-E loops for components with x > 0.03 gradually narrow, which can be attributed to three reasons. The asymmetry observed in the P-E loops for x > 0.03 is attributed to the bias electric field within the ceramic, caused by the pinning effect of defect dipoles and the decreased grain size. The P r initially increases and then decreases, with CLCBN-3WM ceramics achieving an optimal value (\u223c 11.61 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}), which may be related to its large spontaneous polarization (P s). Therefore, an appropriate amount of W/Mo co-substitution for Nb can enhance ferroelectric properties. (a) illustrates the variations in piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) and planar electromechanical coupling coefficient (k p) of CLCBN-100xWM ceramics with different doping levels. Both d 33 and k p initially increase and then decrease with the doping amount increases, showing a trend consistent with P r. The optimal values are achieved at x = 0.03 (d 33 \u223c 16.1 pC/N, k p \u223c 7.7 %). Notably, d 33 is roughly 2.5 times higher than that of CBNO (\u223c 6.5 pC/N), which may be attributed to the presence of a pseudo-tetragonal distortion. The piezoelectric properties of Aurivillius-type compounds primarily originate from the contributions of the perovskite-like layers. can be used to evaluate the piezoelectric properties of CLCBN-100xWM ceramics : where Q and \u03b5 0 denote the electrostrictive coefficient and the dielectric permittivity in vacuum, respectively. Consequently, d 33 can be determined by the product of \u03b5\u2032 and P r. The trend in the variation of \u03b5\u2032 and P r aligns with that of d 33 [as shown in (a)]. Hence, the CLCBN-3WM ceramics, characterized by larger \u03b5\u2032 and P r values, exhibit superior piezoelectric properties. The thermal depoling behavior of CLCBN-100xWM ceramics was evaluated by measuring the d 33 values of the samples after annealing at different temperatures (25\xb0C \u223c 940 \xb0C) for 2 h, as shown in (b). The results indicate that the d 33 value for all CLCBN-100xWM samples decreases slightly at low temperatures (< 400 \xb0C), which is attributed to the presence of unstable non-180\xb0 domains within the samples. As the temperature increases, these domains revert to their initial state due to internal ceramic stress, causing a slight decrease in d 33. (c) illustrates the relationship between normalized d 33 and annealing temperature. revealing that an appropriate amount of W/Mo co-substitution for Nb can improve the d 33 stability, which is caused by the decrease in oxygen vacancy concentration. (d) shows the variation of normalized d 33 with composition after annealing at 800 \xb0C for 2 h. It is evident that d 33 E^{800 \xb0C}/d 33 E^{RT} initially increases and then decreases with the rise of x, possibly due to the pseudo-tetragonal structure. Liu et al. have confirmed that an appropriate amount of the pseudo-tetragonal phase enhances the thermal depoling behavior of CBNO-based ceramics. Additionally, reduced grain sizes increase the energy barrier for domain wall movement, complicating the switching of 180\xb0 domains and enhancing the thermal stability of ceramics. Specifically, the ceramic with x = 0.03 exhibits outstanding thermal stability, retaining 93.7 % (\u223c 15.1 pC/N) of the room temperature d 33 (\u223c 16.1 pC/N). The elemental composition and chemical valence states of CBNO, CLCBN, CLCBN-3WM, and CLCBN-6WM ceramics were assessed using XPS analysis, as illustrated in. The presence of peaks corresponding to Ca, Bi, Nb, O, and C indicates that these elements are present in the ceramics, with additional C 1 s peaks appearing during the testing process. High-resolution XPS spectra of the O 1 s orbitals are presented in. The O 1 s spectrum can be deconvoluted using a Gaussian function into four distinct modes: lattice oxygen (OE^{2-}) at approximately 529.91 eV, highly oxidized oxygen species (O2 E^{2-}/OE^{-}) at 530.88 eV, carbonate or C-O bond (CO3 E^{2-} or C-O) at 532.07 eV, and molecular water or hydroxyl (H2O or -OH) due to physical adsorption at 533.5 eV. Previous research has demonstrated a close relationship between O2 E^{2-}/OE^{-} and the concentration of surface oxygen vacancies. presents the relative area percentage of O2 E^{2}/OE^{-} in the estimated O 1 s fitting peak. It is evident that compared to CBNO ceramics, the relative proportion of O2 E^{2-}/OE^{-} in CLCBN ceramics is higher, indicating a greater concentration of oxygen vacancies. However, the area of O2 E^{2-}/OE^{-} in CLCBN-3WM and CLCBN-6WM ceramics is relatively small, suggesting that W/Mo doping can effectively reduce the concentration of oxygen vacancies in the ceramics. (a) illustrates the temperature dependence of resistivity for CLCBN-100xWM ceramics. \u03c1 gradually decreases with the temperature increases, demonstrating a negative temperature coefficient characteristic of the CLCBN-100xWM sample. The resistivity of the x = 0.03 component is the largest (\u223c 7.4 \xd7 10E^{5}\u03a9\xb7cm at 600 \xb0C), approximately seven times that of CBNO (\u223c 1.1 \xd7 10E^{5} \u03a9\xb7cm at 600 \xb0C). The increase in resistivity for components with x < 0.03 may be attributed to the introduction of W/Mo, which increases atomic diversity in the material. Furthermore, donor doping generates excess free electrons that can counteract the oxygen vacancy (V O \u2219\u2219) and holes (h \u2219) produced by Bi2O3 volatilization at high temperatures. The defect reaction equation is as follows:  The resistivity of the component with x > 0.03 decreases slightly due to high levels of W/Mo co-substitution, which introduces excess electrons and reduces the material's insulating performance. To further investigate the conduction mechanism of CLCBN-100xWM ceramics, the activation energy (E a) for direct current conduction of each sample was calculated using the Arrhenius formula , as depicted in (b) and : where \u03c1 0, k B, and T represent the pre-exponential factor, the Boltzmann constant (k B \u223c 8.617\xd710E^{\u22125} eV/K), and the absolute temperature, respectively. The E a of CBNO ceramics is 1.31 eV, indicating that the conduction mechanism of CBNO is primarily dominated by holes (h E^{\xb7}) and ionic conduction within the tested temperature range. For CLCBN-100xWM ceramics, the E a cannot be fitted by a single straight line, suggesting different conduction mechanisms within the test range. In the low-temperature range (< 500 \xb0C), E a1 ranges between 1.40 and 1.50 eV, which is higher than that of CBNO ceramics. At higher temperatures (> 500 \xb0C), the calculated E a2 ranges from 1.70 to 1.82 eV. (c-d) shows the Ultraviolet-Visible Spectroscopy (UV-Vis) of CBNO samples and the band gap width (E g) calculated based on the Tauc equation : where \u03b1 represents the absorption coefficient, hv is the incident photon energy, A is a constant, and the exponent n is a constant related to the type of semiconductor (for direct band gap semiconductors, n = 1/2; for indirect band gap semiconductors, n = 2). The conduction activation energy E a2 of CLCBN-100xWM ceramics at high temperatures is approximately half of the CBNO band gap width (E g = 3.4 eV). This indicates that there is an intrinsic conduction mechanism in the conduction process. illustrates the impact of oxygen partial pressure (pO2) on the insulation resistivity of CLCBN-3WM ceramics. The resistivity decreases as the oxygen partial pressure increases from 10E^{\u22124} atm (pure N2) to 1 atm (pure O2). To further investigate the conductive mechanism of ceramics under an AC signal, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed on CBNO and CLCBN-3WM samples, as depicted in (e-f). Three semicircles are obtained in the Cole-Cole diagram of the CBNO sample, corresponding to the Warburg effect, grain boundaries, and grains, as the test frequency increases from low to high frequencies. The parallel R-CPE circuit is utilized to fit the impedance data of CLCBN-3WM ceramics. In contrast, the Cole-Cole diagram of CLCBN-3WM ceramics exhibits no Warburg effect, indicating that the ionic conducting behavior was suppressed.

# TITLE
Enhancement of piezoelectric properties and temperature stability of high-Curie temperature CaBi<inf>2</inf>Nb<inf>2</inf>O<inf>9</inf> ceramics

# ABSTRACT
Bismuth calcium niobate (CaBi2Nb2O9, CBNO) is considered a candidate for high-temperature piezoelectric materials due to high-Curie temperature (T
                     C) near 900 Â°C. However, pure CBNO shows a poor piezoelectric coefficient (d
                     33) and low high-temperature resistivity (Ï). In this work, the piezoelectricity, ferroelectricity, and resistivity of CBNO ceramics were significantly improved by constructing pseudo-tetragonal boundary through the co-substitution of Li/Ce at A site and W/Mo at B site. Remarkably, Ca0.92(Li0.5Ce0.5)0.08Bi2Nb1.97(W2/3Mo1/3)0.03O9 (CLCBN-3WM) ceramic exhibits the best performance: ultra-high T
                     C (â¼ 922 Â°C), very high d
                     33 (â¼ 16.1 pC/N), a large remanent polarization (â¼ 11.61 Î¼C/cm2), and very good high-temperature insulation Ï (â¼ 7.4 Ã 105 Î©Â·cm at 600 Â°C), as well as excellent thermal stability with its d
                     33 value degeneration from 16.1 pC/N to 15.1 pC/N from room temperature to 800 Â°C (less than 7.0â¯%). These results indicate that CLCBN-3WM ceramics have significant potential for using in electromechanical transducers operating at high temperatures (600 Â°C or higher).

# INTRODUCTION
For example, piezoelectric acceleration transducers in the aerospace sector require ceramics that not only have a high Curie temperature (T C) but also exhibit excellent piezoelectric coefficients (d 33) and high electrical resistivity (\u03c1). While traditional piezoelectric materials, such as lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate (PMN-PT) , bismuth ferrite-barium titanate (BF-BT) , and potassium sodium niobate (KNN) , exhibited excellent piezoelectric properties, they present lower T C (< 500 \xb0C) and poor \u03c1, rendering them unsuitable for high-temperature applications. In contrast, Aurivillius-type compounds, also known as bismuth layer-structured ferroelectrics (BLSF), have garnered attention due to their high T C and outstanding \u03c1. BLSF ceramics are characterized by the general formula (Bi2O2)E^{2+}(A n-1B n O3n+1)E^{2-}, where A and B represent metal cations with dodecahedral-coordinated and octahedral-coordinated, respectively. The parameter n denotes the number of [BO6] octahedral layers between adjacent bismuth oxide layers, which ranges from 1 to 6. Calcium bismuth niobate ceramics (CaBi2Nb2O9, abbreviated as CBNO) are a representative Aurivillius-type compound with n = 2. Due to their high T C (\u223c 940 \xb0C), substantial spontaneous polarization (P s \u223c 24.4 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}), and excellent depoling temperature (\u223c 800 \xb0C), CBNO ceramics have garnered significant interest. As a result, CBNO ceramics exhibit inferior d 33 and high coercive electric fields, limiting their application in high-temperature piezoelectric sensors. Researchers have employed various approaches, primarily grain orientation techniques and ion doping, to address the suboptimal electrical properties of CBNO-based piezoelectric ceramics. Grain orientation technology involves manipulating the crystal structure orientation within the piezoelectric material to enhance its electrical properties, for instance, the template grain growth (TGG) , hot pressing sintering (HPS) , and spark plasma sintering (SPS). However, due to the layered structure of BLSF ceramics and the anisotropy of the crystal, CBNO ceramics can obtain a large piezoelectric coefficient in the texture direction, but the resistance in this direction can deteriorate significantly. In contrast, ion substitution techniques offer a simple and effective method for enhancing the electrical properties of CBNO ceramics. Many studies currently focus on co-substituting of rare earth ions and alkali metal ions at the A site of the perovskite-like structure in CBNO ceramics. Modifying the A site to create defect dipoles has proven effective in enhancing the electrical properties and temperature stability of CBNO-based piezoelectric ceramics, such as LiCe , NaCe , KCe , LiBiPr , and LiCePr. Moreover, some researchers have explored substituting high-valence ions for Nb in CBNO ceramics, leading to partial crystal structure distortion. Donor doping can introduce excess electrons to compensate for vacancies, thereby improving resistivity, as observed with W , WCr , and MoCr. In this work, we introduced a co-substitution of Li/Ce at A site and W/Mo at B site into CBNO ceramics. The effects of this co-substitution on the microstructure (including crystal structure and surface morphology) and macroscopic properties (such as dielectric performance, piezoelectric properties, and resistivity) of CBNO-based ceramics has been thoroughly investigated. (a-c) illustrates the effects of ion co-doping on the spontaneous polarization, domain size, and insulation properties of the ceramics. The composition of CLCBN-3WM (x = 0.03) exhibits an enhance of the d 33, remanent polarization (P r), and the planar electromechanical coupling coefficient (k p) over CBNO by approximately 149 %, 163 %, and 33 %, respectively, as shown in (d). The T C, \u03c1, and d 33 of Aurivillius-type high-temperature piezoelectric ceramics (T C > 900 \xb0C) reported in recent years are presented in (e). Notably, CLCBN-3WM ceramics exhibit a higher d 33 (\u223c16.1 pC/N), which enhances the detection capability of subtle vibrations and shocks, enabling the acceleration sensor to accurately monitor motion states.

# CONCLUSION
A novel high-temperature piezoelectric ceramic CLCBN-100xWM was synthesized through the solid-state reaction method. The influence of Li/Ce at A site and Mo/W at B site co-substitution on the morphology, phase structure, and electrical properties of CBNO ceramics was systematically investigated. Notably, CLCBN-3WM ceramic exhibits optimal properties with d 33 of 16.1 pC/N, T C around 922 \xb0C, and \u03c1 of 7.4 \xd7 10E^{5} \u03a9\xb7cm at 600 \xb0C, as well as excellent thermal stability which retains 93.7 % (\u223c 15.1 pC/N) of d 33 after annealing at 800 \xb0C for 2 h. Therefore, CLCBN-3WM ceramic is a promising material for high-temperature sensors.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Room-temperature XRD patterns of both CBNO and CLCBN-100xWM ceramics are presented in (a1), all reflection peaks match the CBNO standard card (PDF # 49\u20130608, A21 am space group), without second phase material being generated. This suggests that Li, Ce, W, and Mo can be incorporated into the CBNO lattice, forming a solid solution within the designed doping range. The (115) reflection exhibits the highest intensity, this is consistent with the strongest reflection of (112 n+1) in BLSF ceramics. The detailed contours near 29.0\xb0 and 29.5\xb0 are illustrated in (a2). Notably, the reflection of (115) gradually shifts to a higher angle with increasing W/Mo doping, attributed to the replacement of larger NbE^{5+} ion (0.64 \xc5, CN = 6) by small WE^{6+} ion (0.60 \xc5, CN = 6) and MoE^{6+} ion (0.59 \xc5, CN = 6), leading to unit cell contraction. Additionally, the distance between the (200) and (020) reflections is close to zero with increased W/Mo doping, as displayed in (a3). The reflections (200) and (020) merge into a single peak at doping levels greater than 0.03, indicating an evolution of the crystal structure of the ceramic from the orthorhombic phase to a pseudo-tetragonal phase. This suggests a pseudo-tetragonal phase boundary near x = 0.03, aligning with previously reported findings for CBNO-based piezoelectric ceramics. To further analyze the crystal structure evolution of CLCBN-100xWM ceramics, we performed Rietveld refinement on the collected powder XRD data based on the structural model (space group: A21 am) reported by Blake et al. , as shown in and. The calculated patterns correspond well with the experimental values, exhibiting reasonable \u03c7 E^{2}, R p, and R wp values. The a/b value decreases from 1.00539 to 1.00395 with increasing doping in CLCBN-100xWM ceramics, indicating a gradual deviation of the crystal structure from the orthorhombic phase and a trend toward a pseudo-tetragonal phase with higher symmetry. (b) presents the crystal structure diagram of CLCBN-3WM ceramics. The refined atomic occupancy indicates cation disorder between the (CaNb2O7)E^{2-} layer and the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layer. The occupancy of Ca in the perovskite A site and the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layer is 0.795(7) and 0.125(7), respectively. Similarly, the occupancy of Bi in the perovskite A site and the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layer is 0.053(2) and 0.947(2), respectively. The degrees of tilt and rotation of the [NbO6] octahedron are represented by \u03b1 (the angle between O1-O2 and the c-axis) and \u03b2 (\u2220O4-O4-O4), respectively. The values of \u03b1 and \u03b2 for all samples were calculated based on atomic occupancies obtained from Rietveld refinement, as illustrated in (c1). It is observed that as the doping amount increases, both \u03b1 and \u03b2 gradually increase. Specifically, the variation of \u03b1 is significantly greater than that of \u03b2, as shown in (c2), indicating that the rotation of the [NbO6] octahedron has a more significant effect on the spontaneous polarization intensity in CLCBN-100xWM ceramics. This model is based on the atomic coordinates finely adjusted by the Rietveld method, as listed in. where m i represents the site multiplicity, \u0394x i is the displacement of the atom along the a-axis from its corresponding position in the parent structure, Q i e is the charge carried by the ion, and V represents the volume of a unit cell. The atomic displacement and contribution to P s of each constituent element of CLCBN and CLCBN-3WM ceramics are illustrated in (d). CLCBN-3WM ceramics exhibit a large P s (31.74 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}), which is primarily attributed to the larger atomic displacement of O5. The P s of CLCBN-100xWM ceramics are larger than that of CBNO, which may be due to the increase in lattice distortion caused by the higher doping amount, thus further affecting P s. For x > 0.03 components, P s shows a downward trend, possibly due to the excessive deviation of the ceramic crystal structure from the parent phase, which increases the tetragonality and results in a decrease in P s. All samples exhibit Raman vibration modes consistent with the orthorhombic phase structure within the tested range (20\u20131000 cmE^{\u22121}). Notably, strong phonon vibration modes are observed at approximately 36.5, 55.7, 179.2, 201.3, 583.6, and 815.2 cmE^{\u22121}, denoted as v1-v6, respectively. Generally, the low-wavenumber vibration mode below 200 cmE^{\u22121} is primarily associated with the A site ions in the perovskite structure, while the high-wavenumber vibration above 200 cmE^{\u22121} is attributed to the [NbO6] octahedron. By employing the Lorentz function decomposition of the Raman vibration modes, it is possible to extract 16 independent vibration modes. illustrates the v1-v6 Raman peaks in CLCBN-100xWM ceramics. Among these peaks, v1-v3 are associated with A site CaE^{2+} ions, and v1 and v3 almost do not shift with the increase in doping amount, while v2 experiences a decrease in wavenumber compared to CBNO, attributed to the substitution of LiE^{+} and CeE^{3+} for CaE^{2+}, altering the original CaE^{2+} ion vibration. The v4 peak reflects the degree of distortion in the [NbO6] octahedron. v5 and v6 represent the asymmetric and symmetric vibrations of the [NbO6] octahedron, respectively. In CLCBN-100xWM ceramics, both v5 and v6 show a shift towards lower wavenumbers compared to CBNO. This can be attributed to the rotation and tilt of the octahedron caused by the doping of W/Mo composite ions at the B site, resulting in localized lattice structure distortion. (a-h) presents the surface morphology of CBNO and CLCBN-100xWM ceramics. The average grain size decreases significantly from 7.06 \u03bcm (length) to 4.61 \u03bcm (length) after doping with Li/Ce at the A site. The growth of CLCBN-100xWM ceramic grains in the a-b direction is inhibited, and the grains transform from rod-like structures to block-like forms. The average grain size decreases gradually from 4.61 \u03bcm (length) to 3.66 \u03bcm (length) with the increase of W/Mo co-doping, accompanied by a gradual reduction in the aspect ratio (length/width, as shown in ). This phenomenon may be attributed to the decreased of oxygen vacancy concentration in CLCBN-100xWM ceramics (as discussed later), which impedes ion diffusion during the densification process, thereby slowing both grain and grain boundary diffusion rates and inhibiting overall grain growth. Notably, the microstructure of CLCBN-6WM ceramics includes a small number of abnormal diamond-shaped grains alongside block and elongated strip grains. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping  reveals that the diamond-shaped grains in CLCBN-6WM ceramics are enriched with Ca, W, and Mo elements. In addition, we synthesized a sample with x = 0.07 for XRD analysis and found the formation of impurity phases, as shown in. It can be inferred that the solid solution limit of W and Mo in the CLCBN-100xWM system is approximately x = 0.06. The domain structure of the CLCBN-3WM ceramic sample was further elucidated through TEM images, as depicted in (j). The images reveal a rich nano-scale 180\xb0 domain structure with a width of approximately 6 nm. Previous studies on CBNO ceramics using PFM amplitude imaging showed with a width of around 200 nm. The reduction in domain size and increase in domain wall density are beneficial for enhancing the piezoelectric properties and temperature stability of CBNO-based piezoelectric ceramics. (k) presents HR-TEM images of CLCBN-3WM ceramics, revealing periodic stripes associated with the bismuth oxide layer and [NbO6] layer. The measured distance between adjacent stripes is approximately 1.24 nm, which is about half of the lattice parameter c of CLCBN-3WM ceramic (c = 2.48619 nm, as shown in ). (l) displays the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) images of CLCBNO-3WM ceramics along the [011] axis. Weak (hk0) and (h00) type superlattice reflections are observed in the images, a phenomenon previously reported by Pan et al.. Additionally, a similar superlattice phenomenon has been noted in SrBi2Nb2O9 ceramics. The frequency dependence of the dielectric permittivity (\u03b5\u2032) and dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) for CBNO and CLCBN-100xWM ceramics is shown in. After polarization by a DC electric field, the dielectric permittivity of all samples decreases, which may be due to a reduction in non-180\xb0 domain wall density or changes in domain structure. The resonance and anti-resonance peaks observed at high frequencies in the polarized samples can be attributed to the piezoelectric effect. illustrates the composition dependence of the dielectric permittivity and dielectric loss for all samples at 100 kHz. However, after DC polarization, the dielectric loss of the CLCBN-100xWM ceramic sample increases, which can be attributed to changes in dielectric loss caused by the movement and rearrangement of the domain wall under the electric field. The temperature dependence of the dielectric permittivity and dielectric loss of all samples at 1 MHz is shown in (a-b). As the doping content increases, the T C of the sample decreases from 940 \xb0C to 914 \xb0C, which may be attributed to the enhanced tetragonality of the ceramic crystal structure and a reduced energy barrier for phase transition due to the increased doping content. In CLCBN-100xWM ceramics, the position of Nb is replaced by W/Mo with smaller ionic radii. Additionally, the trend in T C corresponds with the orthorhombicity parameter 2(a-b)/(a+b), indicating that T C is influenced by the degree of crystal distortion. The ferroelectric hysteresis loops (P-E) and current density curves (J-E) of CBNO and CLCBN-100xWM ceramics, as illustrated in (a-h). The J-E curves of CLCBN-100xWM ceramic samples show pronounced current peaks. CLCBN-3WM demonstrates the most standard P-E loops. In contrast, the P-E loops for components with x > 0.03 gradually narrow, which can be attributed to three reasons. The asymmetry observed in the P-E loops for x > 0.03 is attributed to the bias electric field within the ceramic, caused by the pinning effect of defect dipoles and the decreased grain size. The P r initially increases and then decreases, with CLCBN-3WM ceramics achieving an optimal value (\u223c 11.61 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}), which may be related to its large spontaneous polarization (P s). Therefore, an appropriate amount of W/Mo co-substitution for Nb can enhance ferroelectric properties. (a) illustrates the variations in piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) and planar electromechanical coupling coefficient (k p) of CLCBN-100xWM ceramics with different doping levels. Both d 33 and k p initially increase and then decrease with the doping amount increases, showing a trend consistent with P r. The optimal values are achieved at x = 0.03 (d 33 \u223c 16.1 pC/N, k p \u223c 7.7 %). Notably, d 33 is roughly 2.5 times higher than that of CBNO (\u223c 6.5 pC/N), which may be attributed to the presence of a pseudo-tetragonal distortion. The piezoelectric properties of Aurivillius-type compounds primarily originate from the contributions of the perovskite-like layers. can be used to evaluate the piezoelectric properties of CLCBN-100xWM ceramics : where Q and \u03b5 0 denote the electrostrictive coefficient and the dielectric permittivity in vacuum, respectively. Consequently, d 33 can be determined by the product of \u03b5\u2032 and P r. The trend in the variation of \u03b5\u2032 and P r aligns with that of d 33 [as shown in (a)]. Hence, the CLCBN-3WM ceramics, characterized by larger \u03b5\u2032 and P r values, exhibit superior piezoelectric properties. The thermal depoling behavior of CLCBN-100xWM ceramics was evaluated by measuring the d 33 values of the samples after annealing at different temperatures (25\xb0C \u223c 940 \xb0C) for 2 h, as shown in (b). The results indicate that the d 33 value for all CLCBN-100xWM samples decreases slightly at low temperatures (< 400 \xb0C), which is attributed to the presence of unstable non-180\xb0 domains within the samples. As the temperature increases, these domains revert to their initial state due to internal ceramic stress, causing a slight decrease in d 33. (c) illustrates the relationship between normalized d 33 and annealing temperature. revealing that an appropriate amount of W/Mo co-substitution for Nb can improve the d 33 stability, which is caused by the decrease in oxygen vacancy concentration. (d) shows the variation of normalized d 33 with composition after annealing at 800 \xb0C for 2 h. It is evident that d 33 E^{800 \xb0C}/d 33 E^{RT} initially increases and then decreases with the rise of x, possibly due to the pseudo-tetragonal structure. Liu et al. have confirmed that an appropriate amount of the pseudo-tetragonal phase enhances the thermal depoling behavior of CBNO-based ceramics. Additionally, reduced grain sizes increase the energy barrier for domain wall movement, complicating the switching of 180\xb0 domains and enhancing the thermal stability of ceramics. Specifically, the ceramic with x = 0.03 exhibits outstanding thermal stability, retaining 93.7 % (\u223c 15.1 pC/N) of the room temperature d 33 (\u223c 16.1 pC/N). The elemental composition and chemical valence states of CBNO, CLCBN, CLCBN-3WM, and CLCBN-6WM ceramics were assessed using XPS analysis, as illustrated in. The presence of peaks corresponding to Ca, Bi, Nb, O, and C indicates that these elements are present in the ceramics, with additional C 1 s peaks appearing during the testing process. High-resolution XPS spectra of the O 1 s orbitals are presented in. The O 1 s spectrum can be deconvoluted using a Gaussian function into four distinct modes: lattice oxygen (OE^{2-}) at approximately 529.91 eV, highly oxidized oxygen species (O2 E^{2-}/OE^{-}) at 530.88 eV, carbonate or C-O bond (CO3 E^{2-} or C-O) at 532.07 eV, and molecular water or hydroxyl (H2O or -OH) due to physical adsorption at 533.5 eV. Previous research has demonstrated a close relationship between O2 E^{2-}/OE^{-} and the concentration of surface oxygen vacancies. presents the relative area percentage of O2 E^{2}/OE^{-} in the estimated O 1 s fitting peak. It is evident that compared to CBNO ceramics, the relative proportion of O2 E^{2-}/OE^{-} in CLCBN ceramics is higher, indicating a greater concentration of oxygen vacancies. However, the area of O2 E^{2-}/OE^{-} in CLCBN-3WM and CLCBN-6WM ceramics is relatively small, suggesting that W/Mo doping can effectively reduce the concentration of oxygen vacancies in the ceramics. (a) illustrates the temperature dependence of resistivity for CLCBN-100xWM ceramics. \u03c1 gradually decreases with the temperature increases, demonstrating a negative temperature coefficient characteristic of the CLCBN-100xWM sample. The resistivity of the x = 0.03 component is the largest (\u223c 7.4 \xd7 10E^{5}\u03a9\xb7cm at 600 \xb0C), approximately seven times that of CBNO (\u223c 1.1 \xd7 10E^{5} \u03a9\xb7cm at 600 \xb0C). The increase in resistivity for components with x < 0.03 may be attributed to the introduction of W/Mo, which increases atomic diversity in the material. Furthermore, donor doping generates excess free electrons that can counteract the oxygen vacancy (V O \u2219\u2219) and holes (h \u2219) produced by Bi2O3 volatilization at high temperatures. The defect reaction equation is as follows:  The resistivity of the component with x > 0.03 decreases slightly due to high levels of W/Mo co-substitution, which introduces excess electrons and reduces the material's insulating performance. To further investigate the conduction mechanism of CLCBN-100xWM ceramics, the activation energy (E a) for direct current conduction of each sample was calculated using the Arrhenius formula , as depicted in (b) and : where \u03c1 0, k B, and T represent the pre-exponential factor, the Boltzmann constant (k B \u223c 8.617\xd710E^{\u22125} eV/K), and the absolute temperature, respectively. The E a of CBNO ceramics is 1.31 eV, indicating that the conduction mechanism of CBNO is primarily dominated by holes (h E^{\xb7}) and ionic conduction within the tested temperature range. For CLCBN-100xWM ceramics, the E a cannot be fitted by a single straight line, suggesting different conduction mechanisms within the test range. In the low-temperature range (< 500 \xb0C), E a1 ranges between 1.40 and 1.50 eV, which is higher than that of CBNO ceramics. At higher temperatures (> 500 \xb0C), the calculated E a2 ranges from 1.70 to 1.82 eV. (c-d) shows the Ultraviolet-Visible Spectroscopy (UV-Vis) of CBNO samples and the band gap width (E g) calculated based on the Tauc equation : where \u03b1 represents the absorption coefficient, hv is the incident photon energy, A is a constant, and the exponent n is a constant related to the type of semiconductor (for direct band gap semiconductors, n = 1/2; for indirect band gap semiconductors, n = 2). The conduction activation energy E a2 of CLCBN-100xWM ceramics at high temperatures is approximately half of the CBNO band gap width (E g = 3.4 eV). This indicates that there is an intrinsic conduction mechanism in the conduction process. illustrates the impact of oxygen partial pressure (pO2) on the insulation resistivity of CLCBN-3WM ceramics. The resistivity decreases as the oxygen partial pressure increases from 10E^{\u22124} atm (pure N2) to 1 atm (pure O2). To further investigate the conductive mechanism of ceramics under an AC signal, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed on CBNO and CLCBN-3WM samples, as depicted in (e-f). Three semicircles are obtained in the Cole-Cole diagram of the CBNO sample, corresponding to the Warburg effect, grain boundaries, and grains, as the test frequency increases from low to high frequencies. The parallel R-CPE circuit is utilized to fit the impedance data of CLCBN-3WM ceramics. In contrast, the Cole-Cole diagram of CLCBN-3WM ceramics exhibits no Warburg effect, indicating that the ionic conducting behavior was suppressed.

Enhancement of piezoelectric properties and temperature stability of high-Curie temperature CaBi<inf>2</inf>Nb<inf>2</inf>O<inf>9</inf> ceramics

# ABSTRACT
Bismuth calcium niobate (CaBi2Nb2O9, CBNO) is considered a candidate for high-temperature piezoelectric materials due to high-Curie temperature (T
                     C) near 900 Â°C. However, pure CBNO shows a poor piezoelectric coefficient (d
                     33) and low high-temperature resistivity (Ï). In this work, the piezoelectricity, ferroelectricity, and resistivity of CBNO ceramics were significantly improved by constructing pseudo-tetragonal boundary through the co-substitution of Li/Ce at A site and W/Mo at B site. Remarkably, Ca0.92(Li0.5Ce0.5)0.08Bi2Nb1.97(W2/3Mo1/3)0.03O9 (CLCBN-3WM) ceramic exhibits the best performance: ultra-high T
                     C (â¼ 922 Â°C), very high d
                     33 (â¼ 16.1 pC/N), a large remanent polarization (â¼ 11.61 Î¼C/cm2), and very good high-temperature insulation Ï (â¼ 7.4 Ã 105 Î©Â·cm at 600 Â°C), as well as excellent thermal stability with its d
                     33 value degeneration from 16.1 pC/N to 15.1 pC/N from room temperature to 800 Â°C (less than 7.0â¯%). These results indicate that CLCBN-3WM ceramics have significant potential for using in electromechanical transducers operating at high temperatures (600 Â°C or higher).

# INTRODUCTION
For example, piezoelectric acceleration transducers in the aerospace sector require ceramics that not only have a high Curie temperature (T C) but also exhibit excellent piezoelectric coefficients (d 33) and high electrical resistivity (\u03c1). While traditional piezoelectric materials, such as lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate (PMN-PT) , bismuth ferrite-barium titanate (BF-BT) , and potassium sodium niobate (KNN) , exhibited excellent piezoelectric properties, they present lower T C (< 500 \xb0C) and poor \u03c1, rendering them unsuitable for high-temperature applications. In contrast, Aurivillius-type compounds, also known as bismuth layer-structured ferroelectrics (BLSF), have garnered attention due to their high T C and outstanding \u03c1. BLSF ceramics are characterized by the general formula (Bi2O2)E^{2+}(A n-1B n O3n+1)E^{2-}, where A and B represent metal cations with dodecahedral-coordinated and octahedral-coordinated, respectively. The parameter n denotes the number of [BO6] octahedral layers between adjacent bismuth oxide layers, which ranges from 1 to 6. Calcium bismuth niobate ceramics (CaBi2Nb2O9, abbreviated as CBNO) are a representative Aurivillius-type compound with n = 2. Due to their high T C (\u223c 940 \xb0C), substantial spontaneous polarization (P s \u223c 24.4 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}), and excellent depoling temperature (\u223c 800 \xb0C), CBNO ceramics have garnered significant interest. As a result, CBNO ceramics exhibit inferior d 33 and high coercive electric fields, limiting their application in high-temperature piezoelectric sensors. Researchers have employed various approaches, primarily grain orientation techniques and ion doping, to address the suboptimal electrical properties of CBNO-based piezoelectric ceramics. Grain orientation technology involves manipulating the crystal structure orientation within the piezoelectric material to enhance its electrical properties, for instance, the template grain growth (TGG) , hot pressing sintering (HPS) , and spark plasma sintering (SPS). However, due to the layered structure of BLSF ceramics and the anisotropy of the crystal, CBNO ceramics can obtain a large piezoelectric coefficient in the texture direction, but the resistance in this direction can deteriorate significantly. In contrast, ion substitution techniques offer a simple and effective method for enhancing the electrical properties of CBNO ceramics. Many studies currently focus on co-substituting of rare earth ions and alkali metal ions at the A site of the perovskite-like structure in CBNO ceramics. Modifying the A site to create defect dipoles has proven effective in enhancing the electrical properties and temperature stability of CBNO-based piezoelectric ceramics, such as LiCe , NaCe , KCe , LiBiPr , and LiCePr. Moreover, some researchers have explored substituting high-valence ions for Nb in CBNO ceramics, leading to partial crystal structure distortion. Donor doping can introduce excess electrons to compensate for vacancies, thereby improving resistivity, as observed with W , WCr , and MoCr. In this work, we introduced a co-substitution of Li/Ce at A site and W/Mo at B site into CBNO ceramics. The effects of this co-substitution on the microstructure (including crystal structure and surface morphology) and macroscopic properties (such as dielectric performance, piezoelectric properties, and resistivity) of CBNO-based ceramics has been thoroughly investigated. (a-c) illustrates the effects of ion co-doping on the spontaneous polarization, domain size, and insulation properties of the ceramics. The composition of CLCBN-3WM (x = 0.03) exhibits an enhance of the d 33, remanent polarization (P r), and the planar electromechanical coupling coefficient (k p) over CBNO by approximately 149 %, 163 %, and 33 %, respectively, as shown in (d). The T C, \u03c1, and d 33 of Aurivillius-type high-temperature piezoelectric ceramics (T C > 900 \xb0C) reported in recent years are presented in (e). Notably, CLCBN-3WM ceramics exhibit a higher d 33 (\u223c16.1 pC/N), which enhances the detection capability of subtle vibrations and shocks, enabling the acceleration sensor to accurately monitor motion states.

# CONCLUSION
A novel high-temperature piezoelectric ceramic CLCBN-100xWM was synthesized through the solid-state reaction method. The influence of Li/Ce at A site and Mo/W at B site co-substitution on the morphology, phase structure, and electrical properties of CBNO ceramics was systematically investigated. Notably, CLCBN-3WM ceramic exhibits optimal properties with d 33 of 16.1 pC/N, T C around 922 \xb0C, and \u03c1 of 7.4 \xd7 10E^{5} \u03a9\xb7cm at 600 \xb0C, as well as excellent thermal stability which retains 93.7 % (\u223c 15.1 pC/N) of d 33 after annealing at 800 \xb0C for 2 h. Therefore, CLCBN-3WM ceramic is a promising material for high-temperature sensors.
