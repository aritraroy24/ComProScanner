Ltd, including Na2CO3 (99.8 %), K2CO3 (99.8 %), Nb2O5 (99.5 %), Sb2O3 (98 %), Bi2O3 (99 %), ZrO2 (99 %), CaCO3 (99 %), SrCO3 (99 %), BaCO3 (99 %) La2O3 (99.99 %), Fe2O3 (99.99 %), MnO2 (99.6 %) and Al2O3 (99.99 %) were ball milled with ethyl alcohol for 12 h at 300 r/min after weighting according to the stoichiometry ratio. After drying the powders in an oven, the powders were calcined at 890 \xb0C for 6 h. Subsequently, the powders were ball-milled again for 12 h. After that, the powder mixtures were dried and sieved, and pressed into pellets with a diameter of 10 mm at 200 MPa using a cold isostatic press. In the specific sintering process, the temperature was raised to 1190 \xb0C with a heating rate of 10 \xb0C/min, and then rapidly cooled down to 1090 \xb0C and dwelled for 3\u201315 h before naturally cooled down. Crystalline structure was examined at ambient temperature using an X-ray diffractometer (D/Max2550VB+/PC, Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) with Cu-K\u03b1 radiation under 40 kV/200 mA. The microstructure of the investigated ceramics was observed using a field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Merlin Compact, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The grain size distribution was calculated based on the SEM images using a Nano Measurer software. The SEM samples were prepared by polishing the surface of the ceramics and then thermal-etching the samples at 100 \xb0C below their sintering temperatures. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) (FeatureMax, Oxford Instruments, UK) was utilized to detect element distribution. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermofisher, UK) equipped with a standard monochromatic Al Ka excitation source (h\u03c5 = 1361 eV) was used to detect the chemical state of elements. X-band (9.4 GHz) continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra are measured using a spectrometer (ER200-SRC-10/12, Bruker, Germany). The density (\u03c1) of the sintered pellets was measured using the Archimedes\u2019 immersion method. And the relative density (\u03c1') was obtained by dividing \u03c1 with the theoretical density, which is calculated through the XRD profile. Acid-etched domain structure was detected on SEM samples. Before acid-etching, the specimens were poled at 5 kV/mm and polished at room temperature to acquire a mirror plane. After ultrasonic washing, the polished specimens were etched for about 3 min at ambient temperature in a mixed aqueous solution of HCl acid (a mass concentration of \u223c37 %) and HF acid (with a mass concentration \u223c40 %), which mixed in a volume ratio of 1:1. Two sides of the as-sintered samples were printed with silver paste and baked at 600 \xb0C for 30 min to form the electrodes for electrical properties characterization. The direct piezoelectric coefficient (d33) of the poled samples (5 kV/cm for 30 min) was measured by a quasi-static d33 meter (ZJ-3 A, Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Science, China) after aging for 20 h. Thermal aging stability of d33 measurement was assessed in such a way that the samples were annealed at each temperature for 30 min, and then, d33 was tested at room temperature. The planar electromechanical coupling factor (kp) and phase angle (\u03b8) were measured using an impedance analyzer (MFIA 5 MHz, Zurich Instruments, Zurich, Switzerland). Temperature-dependent dielectric properties were measured via a precise LCR meter (E4980, Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) at a heating rate of 3 \u2103/min. The impedance spectroscopy (1 Hz to 1 MHz) was measured using an impedance analyzer (MFIA 5 MHz, Zurich Instruments, Zurich, Switzerland) equipped with a tube furnace (MTF10/25/130, Carbolite Ltd., UK). The ferroelectric, strain, and electrical properties, including ferroelectric hysteresis (P-E) loops, (S-E) loops, (I-E) loops, and the converse piezoelectric coefficient (d 33 *) values were characterized by a ferroelectric tester (TF Analyzer 2000, aixACCT, Germany) equipped with a laser interferometer vibrometer (SP-S120/500, SIOS Me\xdftechnik GmbH, Germany). The Rayleigh coefficients were quantified by measuring the d 33 * as a function of the alternating current electric field. This measurement used a commercial Fiber Optic Sensor (MTI-2100, MTI Instruments Inc., USA), two lock-in amplifiers (SR830 DSP, Stanford Research Systems, USA), and a voltage amplifier (Model PZD700A M/S, Trek, USA). To gain further insight into the nature of contributions of potassium and sodium vacancy (V K/Na \u2032) and niobium vacancy (V Nb \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032), density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed. Moreover, the lattice parameters corresponded to the Amm2 space group, which was the typical phase of KNN at ambient temperature. The K 3s3p4s, Na 2p3s, Nb 4s4p4d5s, and O 2s2p states were treated as valence electrons. We performed structure optimization of 2 \xd7 2 \xd7 2 (40-atoms) pseudocubic supercells of V K/Na \u2032 and V Nb \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032vacancy-defect KNN models. The total charges of the KNN models were set to zero, and the charge distribution was automatically balanced in the DFT calculation.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The XRD diffraction patterns of as-sintered samples demonstrate that all specimens obtain a pure perovskite phase structure, indicating that all ternary components are dissolved into the lattice of KNN without any impurity phase ( (a, b)). Duo to the larger ionic radius of CaE^{2+}, SrE^{2+}, BaE^{2+} than KE^{+} and NaE^{+}, the split diffraction peaks \u223c45\xb0 slightly shift to a lower diffraction angle for group A ((a)). A similar phenomenon is observed for group B ((b)), where the diffraction peaks shift to a higher diffraction angle, owing to the smaller ionic radius of FeE^{3+}, MnE^{3+}/MnE^{4+}, AlE^{3+} than NbE^{5+} . Numerous studies have indicated that KNN-BNZ systems possess polymorphic phase boundary. Herein, according to the comprehensive analysis of temperature-dependent permittivity curves ((c)) and the refined XRD data of {200} ( ) and {210}  re\ufb02ection peaks fitted via the Gauss-Lorentz function, one can see that the polymorphic boundary is retained, although the new group A and group B components are incorporated in KNN-BNZ. The group A exhibits R-T multiphase coexistence except CZ doped sample (R-O-T), which agrees well with the phase structure of KNN-BNZ. The increment of t in group B indicates a better match between the AO12 polyhedron and the BO6 octahedron, and a reduction of lattice distortion, which induces a shift of TR-O and TO-T to lower temperature. Meanwhile, it is widely accepted that complex phase boundaries are essential for acquiring preferable piezoelectric properties, particularly in the coexistence of R-O-T multiple phases in KNN-based ceramics. Furthermore, each phase of PPB corresponds to unique energy distribution, which flattens the energy barrier between different polarization states and facilitates the rotation of the ferroelectric domain. Meanwhile, according to the temperature-dependent permittivity curves of all the samples  and the XRD results, the presence of a dielectric anomaly and a peak corresponding to complex phase boundaries and TC, respectively. Additionally, TC in group A fluctuates slightly, with the maximum value of 255 \u2103 obtained in CZ, which may be due to the phase stabilization effects of co-doping trace amounts of CaZrO3. Furthermore, it is widely accepted that a high TC and stable piezoelectric properties over a wide temperature range is required in commercial applications because the highest safe operating temperature within commercial electronic devices should not exceed 1/2 TC. Next, the microstructure of different samples is investigated by SEM ( ), and the grain size distribution is presented in. An inhomogeneous grain growth behavior is observed in KNNS-BNZ and group A samples, that is coarse grains are tightly surrounded by fine grains. The reasons for composition-induced different microstructures are discussed in the following text (3.3 part). As shown in , the long parallel stripes are distributed more obviously in poled KNNS-BNZ and CZ doped samples, corresponding to the reorientation of non-180\xb0 lamellar domains, while the fine parallel watermarks appear inside part of large-size periodic parallel domains with the average widths of 50\u201370 nm (red circle, which is also called hierarchical nanodomain), indicating the abundant information about coexisting of rich R/O/T complex phase. Interestingly, large-sized watermark lamellar macrodomains (0.8\u20131.8 \u03bcm) are successfully observed in CZ ceramics, containing a large number of hierarchical nanodomains (white rectangle) ((c, d)). In contrast, slim watermark lamellar domains (0.2\u20130.5 \u03bcm) are observed in SZ and BZ specimens ((e, f)). Lamellar domain structure cannot be observed in some small grains (yellow rectangle) in SZ and BZ specimens. According to the empirical formula, the size of the domain in ferroelectrics is closely related to the grain size ,  Therefore, a considerable small-size domain structures are observed in SZ and BZ specimens. On the other hand, SrE^{2+} and BaE^{2+} possess larger ionic radius compared with CaE^{2+}, which leads to a low diffusion rate and mass transfer in the grain growth of ceramics, inducing the reduction of grain and domain size. illustrates the composition-dependent variations of d33 and kp vs the average grain size (AGS). A maximum d33 value of 435 pC/N is obtained in the CZ-doped sample in group A, as well as a maximum d33 value of 398 pC/N is obtained in the LF-doped sample in group B. This trend is directly proportional to \u03b5r\xd7Pr , which is consistent with the phenomenological theory that d33 \u221d \u03b5r\xd7Pr. Furthermore, kp exhibits a similar variation tendency with d33, that is the maximum \u03b8 (\u03b8max) in the CZ sample represents the highest poling efficiency and highly saturated polarization state. Interestingly, the maximum d33 in groups A and B corresponds to the largest grain size in each group ((a)). Additionally, the maximum piezoelectric properties are realized in CZ-doped sample (d33=435 pC/N, kp=0.62). This can be attributed to the extrinsic contribution of a complex hierarchical domain with high domain-wall density  and lower domain switching resistance (larger Pr, Pmax, and \u03b8max). An interesting phenomenon is observed wherein the LF-doped sample with a smaller grain size exhibits better piezoelectric properties than the BZ-doped sample with a larger grain size. This can be attributed to the shift of the polymorphic phase boundary of the LF-doped sample to ambient temperature ((d)), inducing a lower TC and enhanced piezo/ferroelectric properties. Similar enhanced piezo/ferroelectric effects are observed in other research. (b) depicts the temperature-dependent d33 in thermal depolarization behavior, while d33 of all the samples decreases continuously with increasing temperature, reaching 0 pC/N above TC, which is consistent with the results of temperature-dependent dielectric spectra. Moreover, the advantage of CZ-doped samples becomes more pronounced at higher test temperatures, and it exhibits a high d33 retention rate of 84.4 % across a wide temperature range of 25\u2013160 \u2103 ((c)), indicating superiority over other co-doped KNN-based ceramics , and even comparable to PZT ceramics (PZT-5 exhibits \u223c80 % retention rate of d33 from 25 \u2103 to 160 \u2103). Additionally, although the LF-doped sample exhibits the maximum d33 in group B, it is at the cost of temperature stability of piezoelectric properties. The d33 of the LF-doped sample noticeably decreases with increasing temperature, especially beyond 100 \u2103. Meanwhile, the trend of the temperature-dependent d33 for different samples is in consistent with the trend in diffuseness index (\u03b3) fitted in the modified Curie-Weiss law. Normally, regulating phase engineering through multicomponent doping leads to a significant decrease in TC, resulting in the existence of an \u2018inversion relationship\u2019 between d33 and TC. However, CZ achieves both excellent d33 and a high TC, as shown in (d). This result offers significant advantages in most lead-free KNN-based systems, and even outperforms some commercial Pb-based ceramics (i.e., PZT-4). Due to the enhancement of the extrinsic contribution of domain walls in larger grain size, peak values of the maximum polarization (Pmax), remanent polarization (Pr) is obtained in the CZ-doped sample for group A. Similarly, peak values are also obtained in the LF-doped sample for group B. Correspondingly, larger electrostrains are also observed in CZ and LF doped samples in group A/B, indicating a significant enhancement of the switching ability of the ferroelectric domain during polarization. Notably, owing to the proximity of the PPB to room temperature, the intrinsic contribution of electrostriction is promoted, leading to a noticeable enhancement of ferroelectricity in the LF-doped sample, and similar results were observed in previous researches. The temperature-dependent unipolar P-E and S-E curves of different specimens were in-situ measured under an electric field of 40 kV/cm and 10 Hz ( and S7). The Suni and d33* are slightly enhanced within the range of \u223c50\u201375 \u2103, owing to their concordance with the multiphase coexistence region . Additionally, the temperature stability of electrostrain exhibits an analogous trend with d33, that is CZ exhibits preferable temperature stability of Suni and d33* (also known as reverse piezoelectric coefficient, d33* = Smax/Emax), associating with a stable temperature-dependent S-E and P-E curves, which achieves a maximum of 475 pm/V at 75 \u2103 and maintaining a high value of 426 pm/V even at 175 \u2103, exceeding that of most reported binary/ternary co-doped KNN-based systems. In contrast, the temperature-dependent electrostrain of the LF-doped sample significantly decreases with the temperature increasing. To quantitatively analyze the temperature stability of the electrostrain, the coefficient (\u03b7) is given below: where d 33 * T and d 33 * 25\u2103 are reverse piezoelectric coefficient at different test temperatures and ambient temperature, respectively. Normally, \u03b7 should be limited within \xb110 % to ensure commercial applications. Strikingly, the CZ specimen can realize this rigid requirement from 25 \u2103 to 175 \u2103. In contrast, LF meets commercial requirement only within 25\u2013100 \u2103. Particularly, a major leakage current is observed in LF at 175 \u2103, as indicated by the shape of the P-E loops (Pr>Pmax) ((f)). To elucidate the origin of the composition-induced grain size effect in groups A and B, XPS was carried out to analyze the chemical state of elements ( ). NbE^{5+} was detected in KNNS-BNZ and CZ specimens, with the highest binding energies (\u223c207 eV) observed in the XPS high-resolution Nb 3d spectra ((a, b)). Although no obvious enrichment of elements was observed in EDS of CZ and LF samples due to limitations in measurement precision , mixed valences of niobium were observed in the LF-doped sample (\u223c206 eV and \u223c207 eV for Nb3d5/2 represent NbE^{4+} and NbE^{5+}, respectively ((c)) , which is likely attributed to the creation of the niobium vacancy (V Nb \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032). The quasi-free electron located at niobium vacancy could reduce the NbE^{5+} to NbE^{4+}. Similar phenomena were observed in La-doped BaTiO3 systems, where A-site donor doping leads to the formation of B-site vacancies. Moreover, smaller peak at 710.8 eV is detected in LF specimen ((d)), indicating the presence of FeE^{3+} in the LF-doped sample. To further elucidate the effect of compositional effect in different groups, EPR spectra of CZ and LF are presented in (a, b). Notably, the resonance peak at \u223c150 mT represents the formation of (Fe Nb \u2032\u2032\u2212 V O \u2022\u2022) defect dipole in LF specimens , while intrinsic defect of alkaline vacancies (V K/Na \u2032) and niobium vacancy (V Nb \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032) are detected at gyromagnetic constants (g) of 1.974 and 2.004, respectively. Similar representative paramagnetic point defects were observed in rare earth ion-doped BaTiO3 systems. According to the principle of charge balance, the defect reaction of the A&B group in this work can be described as follows:  Or, the defect reaction can also be described as follows:  Besides, evaporation of potassium and sodium elements is unavoidable to form alkaline vacancies (V K/Na \u2032). Thus, except for alkaline vacancies (V K/Na \u2032) compensation, niobium vacancy (V Nb \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032) is also possibly present in KNN-based systems. Based on XPS and EPR results, it is reasonably predicted that, the defect reaction is dominated by for CZ, while for LF, the defect reaction is dominated by. Furthermore, the effect of charge density calculated by DFT calculation is presented in (c). Particularly, compared with V K/Na \u2032, the negative charge density around V Nb \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 remarkable increase. Such intensive negative electrostatic potential prevents diffusion of V Nb \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 in the KNN lattice, which impedes grain growth. Some previous research has indicated that V K/Na \u2032 contributes to grain growth, whereas V Nb \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 plays an opposing effect. Therefore, compared with doping the CaE^{2+} in the A-site, the doping of LaE^{3+} produces more V Nb \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032, which concentrates at the grain boundary, and greatly reduces the migration rate of grain boundaries, leading to a significant restraining effect of mass transfer in KNN-based ceramics ((d)). Subsequently, the complex impedance spectra of CZ and LF ceramics are investigated in. Generally, a substantial decrease in resistivity occurs with the concomitant creation of NbE^{4+} leading to lower resistivity in LF. Additionally, the activation energy (Ea) of bulk conductivity (\u03c3b), calculated using the Arrhenius law, exhibits similar values in CZ and LF specimens, indicating similar V O \u2022\u2022 contributions in ternary co-doped systems. Particularly, the LF exhibits minimum grain boundary resistance at high temperatures, and the grain boundary resistance gradually increases with the temperature decreasing. These results indicate the accumulation of defect dipoles (e.g., V K/Na \u2032\u2212 V O \u2022\u2022, V Nb \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2212 V O \u2022\u2022, and Fe Nb \u2032\u2032\u2212 V O \u2022\u2022) at the grain boundary. A similar phenomenon of grain boundary resistance is observed in Fe and La co-doped BaTiO3 ceramics. The doping ions at A-site with smaller ionic radius and lower ionic polarizability  have a larger diffusion coefficient in the lattice of KNN ceramics, inducing preferable element diffusion in a competitive chemical reaction, and are favorable to the formation of oversize grains and complex hierarchical domain, which facilitates the enhancement of piezoelectric properties (see 3.2 part). Since chemical composition simultaneously influences grain size, crystal structure, and defect chemistry, gaining clear insight into the grain size effect on the piezoelectric properties of KNN-based ceramics is challenging. On this basis, CZ samples with superior piezoelectric properties and temperature stability are fabricated using TSS under different dwelling times of 3 h, 6 h, 10 h and 15 h (abbreviated as CZ-3 h, CZ-6 h, CZ-10 h and CZ-15 h, respectively). Clearly, all CZ samples fabricated using different sintering technologies exhibit a typical ABO3-type perovskite structure without any impurity phase ( (a)). Additionally, it is interesting to note that the {200} diffraction peaks start to distort and new diffraction patterns that match the R-O-T multiphase coexistence occur for CZ-10 h and CZ-15 h samples ((b-e)), associated with slight fluctuations of TC , indicating a gradually evolution of the phase structure with increasing dwelling time during TSS. Generally, as the dwelling time gradual increases, the volatilization of alkali elements (K/Na) intensifies, which is summarized by the following reaction :  Similar variations in phase structure were observed in other KNN systems. Furthermore, it has been reported that KNN-based ceramics sintered in a reducing atmosphere can produce oxygen vacancies, which promote a gradual evolution of phase structure. Therefore, we propose that the enhancement of dwelling time under TSS can enhance K/Na volatilization and increase oxygen vacancies, leading to the slight variation of phase structure. SEM morphology of CZ samples under different sintering conditions is shown in. Notably, a slight amount of abnormal coarse grains (\u223c20 \u03bcm) appears in CZ-3 h, which embeds within masses of small grains. Particularly, significantly sustainable growth of small grains is observed when extending the dwelling time up to 6 h in TSS, exhibiting abnormal regions with smaller grains surrounding abnormal coarse grains, which is beneficial to achieve a dense microstructure and improving electrical properties. Additionally, as the dwelling time increases, the maximum grain size continuously increases, and some abnormal grains with considerable coarse grain (\u223c54 \u03bcm) are even found in the CZ-15 h sample. Furthermore, photos of CZ samples show slight color differences, yet all have high densification (>95 %) under different sintering conditions. Therefore, we conclude that the sintering conditions in TSS also have a significant impact on the formation of oversize grains, while a noticeable secondary grain growth is observed in the TSS process. During two-step sintering, the KNN-based samples are heated to a higher temperature (T1) within a shorter time in the first stage, which promotes the formation of recrystallized seeds. In the second stage, the ceramics are rapidly cooled to a lower temperature (T2), promoting the diffusion of grain boundaries under the effect of capillary forces. As a result, the average grain size (AGS) rapidly enhances with the dense arrangement of grain morphologies. To further investigate the relationship between the sintering process and domain structure, the polished and acid-etched domain patterns of CZ specimens under different sintering conditions are presented in. Although a large number of small-sized grains (<5 \u03bcm) and many holes is observed in CZ-3 h due to acid over-etching, large-size watermark and zigzag domains are sporadically observed in oversize grains ((a)). Particularly, a large volume density of domain walls is observed in CZ-15 h, while a mass of hierarchical nanodomains (50\u201370 nm) is observed inside the broad lamellar domain structure (0.8\u20131.8 \u03bcm). The piezo-/ferroelectric properties of CZ samples under different sintering conditions are exhibited in. An interesting phenomenon is that the grain size effect has a significant impact on piezoelectric properties, particularly the d33 of CZ samples increases to more than 400 pC/N, associated with a significant improvement in temperature stability with a dwelling time of up to 6 h ( (a, b)). Subsequently, the d33 gradually increases to 435 pC/N under a dwelling time of 15 h, exhibiting a trend akin to the changes observed in AGS. Additionally, compared with CZ-3 h samples, the ferroelectric hysteresis loops become more saturated, with a slight increase in Pr and electrostrain with increasing dwelling time up to 6 h. This change can be attributed to the promotion of domain reorientation and domain wall motion in coarse grain (discussed in the following text), leading to a superior orientation of the non-180\xb0 domain along the direction of the electric field. Additionally, complex hierarchical nanodomains, large volume density domain of rich R/T/O phase-related subordinate domain features are achieved in CZ-15, slightly enhancing piezoelectricity. Particularly, the grain size increases significantly with a dwelling time of up to 6 h in the second stage of TSS, leading to the construction of R/O/T multiphase coexistence. With increasing the fraction of oversize grain, it realizes a large-sized hierarchical domain architecture (0.8\u20131.8 \u03bcm) with a high-volume density of sporadic nanodomains (50\u201370 nm), resulting in superior piezoelectric properties. In order to clarify the origin of the relationship between the grain size effect and piezoelectric properties, Rayleigh analysis was performed on CZ specimens under different conditions in TSS to quantify the intrinsic and extrinsic contributions on piezoelectric properties ( ), while the applied electric fields should less than Ec/2 to ensure that the domain wall density is unchanged. Rayleigh law can be expressed as follows : where E0 is the level of the applied electric field, dinit is the initial inverse piezoelectric coefficient, which represents the intrinsic contributions from both the inherent lattice distortion and reversible contributions of domain, and \u03b1E0 presents the extrinsic contribution of irreversible domain wall motion. Additionally, the variations of dint and \u03b1 are depicted in (d), showing a rapid increase with extending dwelling time in TSS, which aligns with the changes of d33 and kP. These results indicate that the grain size effect has a significant synergistic effect on both the intrinsic contribution (dint) of polarization rotation and the extrinsic contribution (\u03b1E0) of irreversible domain wall motion, contributing to the enhancement of piezoelectric properties. Notably, the ratio of extrinsic contribution exhibits a similar trend as \u03b1 reaches its maximum at CZ-15 h ((e)), suggesting that the increase in extrinsic contribution plays a significant role in optimizing piezoelectric properties with a dwelling time of up to 6 h in TSS. Meanwhile, the \u03b8max in frequency-dependent impedance spectra represents poling efficiency, while an ideal polarization effect can be realized when \u03b8 reaches nearly 90\xb0. Notably, the \u03b8max significantly increases with the dwelling time up to 6 h , indicating efficient domain switching at the same applied electric field. Therefore, we conclude that KNN ceramics with large grain size obtain superior piezoelectric properties due to the following reasons. This improvement in both intrinsic and extrinsic contributions induce an excellent ferroelectric softening effect (d33=435 pC/N, kp=0.62) and a preferable temperature stability of both piezoelectric properties and electrostrain (d33 retention rate of 84.4 % at 160 \u2103, \u03b7=13.4 % at 200 \u2103) in CZ-15 h ceramic.

Ltd, including Na2CO3 (99.8 %), K2CO3 (99.8 %), Nb2O5 (99.5 %), Sb2O3 (98 %), Bi2O3 (99 %), ZrO2 (99 %), CaCO3 (99 %), SrCO3 (99 %), BaCO3 (99 %) La2O3 (99.99 %), Fe2O3 (99.99 %), MnO2 (99.6 %) and Al2O3 (99.99 %) were ball milled with ethyl alcohol for 12 h at 300 r/min after weighting according to the stoichiometry ratio. After drying the powders in an oven, the powders were calcined at 890 \xb0C for 6 h. Subsequently, the powders were ball-milled again for 12 h. After that, the powder mixtures were dried and sieved, and pressed into pellets with a diameter of 10 mm at 200 MPa using a cold isostatic press. In the specific sintering process, the temperature was raised to 1190 \xb0C with a heating rate of 10 \xb0C/min, and then rapidly cooled down to 1090 \xb0C and dwelled for 3\u201315 h before naturally cooled down. Crystalline structure was examined at ambient temperature using an X-ray diffractometer (D/Max2550VB+/PC, Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) with Cu-K\u03b1 radiation under 40 kV/200 mA.

X-band (9.4 GHz) continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra are measured using a spectrometer (ER200-SRC-10/12, Bruker, Germany). The density (\u03c1) of the sintered pellets was measured using the Archimedes\u2019 immersion method. And the relative density (\u03c1') was obtained by dividing \u03c1 with the theoretical density, which is calculated through the XRD profile. Acid-etched domain structure was detected on SEM samples. Before acid-etching, the specimens were poled at 5 kV/mm and polished at room temperature to acquire a mirror plane. After ultrasonic washing, the polished specimens were etched for about 3 min at ambient temperature in a mixed aqueous solution of HCl acid (a mass concentration of \u223c37 %) and HF acid (with a mass concentration \u223c40 %), which mixed in a volume ratio of 1:1. Two sides of the as-sintered samples were printed with silver paste and baked at 600 \xb0C for 30 min to form the electrodes for electrical properties characterization. The direct piezoelectric coefficient (d33) of the poled samples (5 kV/cm for 30 min) was measured by a quasi-static d33 meter (ZJ-3 A, Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Science, China) after aging for 20 h. Thermal aging stability of d33 measurement was assessed in such a way that the samples were annealed at each temperature for 30 min, and then, d33 was tested at room temperature. The planar electromechanical coupling factor (kp) and phase angle (\u03b8) were measured using an impedance analyzer (MFIA 5 MHz, Zurich Instruments, Zurich, Switzerland). Temperature-dependent dielectric properties were measured via a precise LCR meter (E4980, Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) at a heating rate of 3 \u2103/min. The impedance spectroscopy (1 Hz to 1 MHz) was measured using an impedance analyzer (MFIA 5 MHz, Zurich Instruments, Zurich, Switzerland) equipped with a tube furnace (MTF10/25/130, Carbolite Ltd., UK). The ferroelectric, strain, and electrical properties, including ferroelectric hysteresis (P-E) loops, (S-E) loops, (I-E) loops, and the converse piezoelectric coefficient (d 33 *) values were characterized by a ferroelectric tester (TF Analyzer 2000, aixACCT, Germany) equipped with a laser interferometer vibrometer (SP-S120/500, SIOS Me\xdftechnik GmbH, Germany). The Rayleigh coefficients were quantified by measuring the d 33 * as a function of the alternating current electric field. This measurement used a commercial Fiber Optic Sensor (MTI-2100, MTI Instruments Inc., USA), two lock-in amplifiers (SR830 DSP, Stanford Research Systems, USA), and a voltage amplifier (Model PZD700A M/S, Trek, USA). To gain further insight into the nature of contributions of potassium and sodium vacancy (V K/Na \u2032) and niobium vacancy (V Nb \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032), density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed. Moreover, the lattice parameters corresponded to the Amm2 space group, which was the typical phase of KNN at ambient temperature. The K 3s3p4s, Na 2p3s, Nb 4s4p4d5s, and O 2s2p states were treated as valence electrons. We performed structure optimization of 2 \xd7 2 \xd7 2 (40-atoms) pseudocubic supercells of V K/Na \u2032 and V Nb \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032vacancy-defect KNN models. The total charges of the KNN models were set to zero, and the charge distribution was automatically balanced in the DFT calculation.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The XRD diffraction patterns of as-sintered samples demonstrate that all specimens obtain a pure perovskite phase structure, indicating that all ternary components are dissolved into the lattice of KNN without any impurity phase ( (a, b)). Duo to the larger ionic radius of CaE^{2+}, SrE^{2+}, BaE^{2+} than KE^{+} and NaE^{+}, the split diffraction peaks \u223c45\xb0 slightly shift to a lower diffraction angle for group A ((a)). A similar phenomenon is observed for group B ((b)), where the diffraction peaks shift to a higher diffraction angle, owing to the smaller ionic radius of FeE^{3+}, MnE^{3+}/MnE^{4+}, AlE^{3+} than NbE^{5+} . Numerous studies have indicated that KNN-BNZ systems possess polymorphic phase boundary. Herein, according to the comprehensive analysis of temperature-dependent permittivity curves ((c)) and the refined XRD data of {200} ( ) and {210}  re\ufb02ection peaks fitted via the Gauss-Lorentz function, one can see that the polymorphic boundary is retained, although the new group A and group B components are incorporated in KNN-BNZ. The group A exhibits R-T multiphase coexistence except CZ doped sample (R-O-T), which agrees well with the phase structure of KNN-BNZ. The increment of t in group B indicates a better match between the AO12 polyhedron and the BO6 octahedron, and a reduction of lattice distortion, which induces a shift of TR-O and TO-T to lower temperature. Meanwhile, it is widely accepted that complex phase boundaries are essential for acquiring preferable piezoelectric properties, particularly in the coexistence of R-O-T multiple phases in KNN-based ceramics. Furthermore, each phase of PPB corresponds to unique energy distribution, which flattens the energy barrier between different polarization states and facilitates the rotation of the ferroelectric domain. Meanwhile, according to the temperature-dependent permittivity curves of all the samples  and the XRD results, the presence of a dielectric anomaly and a peak corresponding to complex phase boundaries and TC, respectively. Additionally, TC in group A fluctuates slightly, with the maximum value of 255 \u2103 obtained in CZ, which may be due to the phase stabilization effects of co-doping trace amounts of CaZrO3. Furthermore, it is widely accepted that a high TC and stable piezoelectric properties over a wide temperature range is required in commercial applications because the highest safe operating temperature within commercial electronic devices should not exceed 1/2 TC. Next, the microstructure of different samples is investigated by SEM ( ), and the grain size distribution is presented in. An inhomogeneous grain growth behavior is observed in KNNS-BNZ and group A samples, that is coarse grains are tightly surrounded by fine grains. The reasons for composition-induced different microstructures are discussed in the following text (3.3 part). As shown in , the long parallel stripes are distributed more obviously in poled KNNS-BNZ and CZ doped samples, corresponding to the reorientation of non-180\xb0 lamellar domains, while the fine parallel watermarks appear inside part of large-size periodic parallel domains with the average widths of 50\u201370 nm (red circle, which is also called hierarchical nanodomain), indicating the abundant information about coexisting of rich R/O/T complex phase. Interestingly, large-sized watermark lamellar macrodomains (0.8\u20131.8 \u03bcm) are successfully observed in CZ ceramics, containing a large number of hierarchical nanodomains (white rectangle) ((c, d)). In contrast, slim watermark lamellar domains (0.2\u20130.5 \u03bcm) are observed in SZ and BZ specimens ((e, f)). Lamellar domain structure cannot be observed in some small grains (yellow rectangle) in SZ and BZ specimens. According to the empirical formula, the size of the domain in ferroelectrics is closely related to the grain size ,  Therefore, a considerable small-size domain structures are observed in SZ and BZ specimens. On the other hand, SrE^{2+} and BaE^{2+} possess larger ionic radius compared with CaE^{2+}, which leads to a low diffusion rate and mass transfer in the grain growth of ceramics, inducing the reduction of grain and domain size. illustrates the composition-dependent variations of d33 and kp vs the average grain size (AGS). A maximum d33 value of 435 pC/N is obtained in the CZ-doped sample in group A, as well as a maximum d33 value of 398 pC/N is obtained in the LF-doped sample in group B. This trend is directly proportional to \u03b5r\xd7Pr , which is consistent with the phenomenological theory that d33 \u221d \u03b5r\xd7Pr. Furthermore, kp exhibits a similar variation tendency with d33, that is the maximum \u03b8 (\u03b8max) in the CZ sample represents the highest poling efficiency and highly saturated polarization state. Interestingly, the maximum d33 in groups A and B corresponds to the largest grain size in each group ((a)). Additionally, the maximum piezoelectric properties are realized in CZ-doped sample (d33=435 pC/N, kp=0.62). This can be attributed to the extrinsic contribution of a complex hierarchical domain with high domain-wall density  and lower domain switching resistance (larger Pr, Pmax, and \u03b8max). An interesting phenomenon is observed wherein the LF-doped sample with a smaller grain size exhibits better piezoelectric properties than the BZ-doped sample with a larger grain size. This can be attributed to the shift of the polymorphic phase boundary of the LF-doped sample to ambient temperature ((d)), inducing a lower TC and enhanced piezo/ferroelectric properties. Similar enhanced piezo/ferroelectric effects are observed in other research. (b) depicts the temperature-dependent d33 in thermal depolarization behavior, while d33 of all the samples decreases continuously with increasing temperature, reaching 0 pC/N above TC, which is consistent with the results of temperature-dependent dielectric spectra. Moreover, the advantage of CZ-doped samples becomes more pronounced at higher test temperatures, and it exhibits a high d33 retention rate of 84.4 % across a wide temperature range of 25\u2013160 \u2103 ((c)), indicating superiority over other co-doped KNN-based ceramics , and even comparable to PZT ceramics (PZT-5 exhibits \u223c80 % retention rate of d33 from 25 \u2103 to 160 \u2103). Additionally, although the LF-doped sample exhibits the maximum d33 in group B, it is at the cost of temperature stability of piezoelectric properties. The d33 of the LF-doped sample noticeably decreases with increasing temperature, especially beyond 100 \u2103. Meanwhile, the trend of the temperature-dependent d33 for different samples is in consistent with the trend in diffuseness index (\u03b3) fitted in the modified Curie-Weiss law. Normally, regulating phase engineering through multicomponent doping leads to a significant decrease in TC, resulting in the existence of an \u2018inversion relationship\u2019 between d33 and TC. However, CZ achieves both excellent d33 and a high TC, as shown in (d). This result offers significant advantages in most lead-free KNN-based systems, and even outperforms some commercial Pb-based ceramics (i.e., PZT-4). Due to the enhancement of the extrinsic contribution of domain walls in larger grain size, peak values of the maximum polarization (Pmax), remanent polarization (Pr) is obtained in the CZ-doped sample for group A. Similarly, peak values are also obtained in the LF-doped sample for group B. Correspondingly, larger electrostrains are also observed in CZ and LF doped samples in group A/B, indicating a significant enhancement of the switching ability of the ferroelectric domain during polarization. Notably, owing to the proximity of the PPB to room temperature, the intrinsic contribution of electrostriction is promoted, leading to a noticeable enhancement of ferroelectricity in the LF-doped sample, and similar results were observed in previous researches. The temperature-dependent unipolar P-E and S-E curves of different specimens were in-situ measured under an electric field of 40 kV/cm and 10 Hz ( and S7). The Suni and d33* are slightly enhanced within the range of \u223c50\u201375 \u2103, owing to their concordance with the multiphase coexistence region . Additionally, the temperature stability of electrostrain exhibits an analogous trend with d33, that is CZ exhibits preferable temperature stability of Suni and d33* (also known as reverse piezoelectric coefficient, d33* = Smax/Emax), associating with a stable temperature-dependent S-E and P-E curves, which achieves a maximum of 475 pm/V at 75 \u2103 and maintaining a high value of 426 pm/V even at 175 \u2103, exceeding that of most reported binary/ternary co-doped KNN-based systems. In contrast, the temperature-dependent electrostrain of the LF-doped sample significantly decreases with the temperature increasing. To quantitatively analyze the temperature stability of the electrostrain, the coefficient (\u03b7) is given below: where d 33 * T and d 33 * 25\u2103 are reverse piezoelectric coefficient at different test temperatures and ambient temperature, respectively. Normally, \u03b7 should be limited within \xb110 % to ensure commercial applications. Strikingly, the CZ specimen can realize this rigid requirement from 25 \u2103 to 175 \u2103. In contrast, LF meets commercial requirement only within 25\u2013100 \u2103. Particularly, a major leakage current is observed in LF at 175 \u2103, as indicated by the shape of the P-E loops (Pr>Pmax) ((f)). To elucidate the origin of the composition-induced grain size effect in groups A and B, XPS was carried out to analyze the chemical state of elements ( ). NbE^{5+} was detected in KNNS-BNZ and CZ specimens, with the highest binding energies (\u223c207 eV) observed in the XPS high-resolution Nb 3d spectra ((a, b)). Although no obvious enrichment of elements was observed in EDS of CZ and LF samples due to limitations in measurement precision , mixed valences of niobium were observed in the LF-doped sample (\u223c206 eV and \u223c207 eV for Nb3d5/2 represent NbE^{4+} and NbE^{5+}, respectively ((c)) , which is likely attributed to the creation of the niobium vacancy (V Nb \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032). The quasi-free electron located at niobium vacancy could reduce the NbE^{5+} to NbE^{4+}. Similar phenomena were observed in La-doped BaTiO3 systems, where A-site donor doping leads to the formation of B-site vacancies. Moreover, smaller peak at 710.8 eV is detected in LF specimen ((d)), indicating the presence of FeE^{3+} in the LF-doped sample. To further elucidate the effect of compositional effect in different groups, EPR spectra of CZ and LF are presented in (a, b). Notably, the resonance peak at \u223c150 mT represents the formation of (Fe Nb \u2032\u2032\u2212 V O \u2022\u2022) defect dipole in LF specimens , while intrinsic defect of alkaline vacancies (V K/Na \u2032) and niobium vacancy (V Nb \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032) are detected at gyromagnetic constants (g) of 1.974 and 2.004, respectively. Similar representative paramagnetic point defects were observed in rare earth ion-doped BaTiO3 systems. According to the principle of charge balance, the defect reaction of the A&B group in this work can be described as follows:  Or, the defect reaction can also be described as follows:  Besides, evaporation of potassium and sodium elements is unavoidable to form alkaline vacancies (V K/Na \u2032). Thus, except for alkaline vacancies (V K/Na \u2032) compensation, niobium vacancy (V Nb \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032) is also possibly present in KNN-based systems. Based on XPS and EPR results, it is reasonably predicted that, the defect reaction is dominated by for CZ, while for LF, the defect reaction is dominated by. Furthermore, the effect of charge density calculated by DFT calculation is presented in (c). Particularly, compared with V K/Na \u2032, the negative charge density around V Nb \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 remarkable increase. Such intensive negative electrostatic potential prevents diffusion of V Nb \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 in the KNN lattice, which impedes grain growth. Some previous research has indicated that V K/Na \u2032 contributes to grain growth, whereas V Nb \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 plays an opposing effect. Therefore, compared with doping the CaE^{2+} in the A-site, the doping of LaE^{3+} produces more V Nb \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032, which concentrates at the grain boundary, and greatly reduces the migration rate of grain boundaries, leading to a significant restraining effect of mass transfer in KNN-based ceramics ((d)). Subsequently, the complex impedance spectra of CZ and LF ceramics are investigated in. Generally, a substantial decrease in resistivity occurs with the concomitant creation of NbE^{4+} leading to lower resistivity in LF. Additionally, the activation energy (Ea) of bulk conductivity (\u03c3b), calculated using the Arrhenius law, exhibits similar values in CZ and LF specimens, indicating similar V O \u2022\u2022 contributions in ternary co-doped systems. Particularly, the LF exhibits minimum grain boundary resistance at high temperatures, and the grain boundary resistance gradually increases with the temperature decreasing. These results indicate the accumulation of defect dipoles (e.g., V K/Na \u2032\u2212 V O \u2022\u2022, V Nb \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2212 V O \u2022\u2022, and Fe Nb \u2032\u2032\u2212 V O \u2022\u2022) at the grain boundary. A similar phenomenon of grain boundary resistance is observed in Fe and La co-doped BaTiO3 ceramics. The doping ions at A-site with smaller ionic radius and lower ionic polarizability  have a larger diffusion coefficient in the lattice of KNN ceramics, inducing preferable element diffusion in a competitive chemical reaction, and are favorable to the formation of oversize grains and complex hierarchical domain, which facilitates the enhancement of piezoelectric properties (see 3.2 part). Since chemical composition simultaneously influences grain size, crystal structure, and defect chemistry, gaining clear insight into the grain size effect on the piezoelectric properties of KNN-based ceramics is challenging. On this basis, CZ samples with superior piezoelectric properties and temperature stability are fabricated using TSS under different dwelling times of 3 h, 6 h, 10 h and 15 h (abbreviated as CZ-3 h, CZ-6 h, CZ-10 h and CZ-15 h, respectively). Clearly, all CZ samples fabricated using different sintering technologies exhibit a typical ABO3-type perovskite structure without any impurity phase ( (a)). Additionally, it is interesting to note that the {200} diffraction peaks start to distort and new diffraction patterns that match the R-O-T multiphase coexistence occur for CZ-10 h and CZ-15 h samples ((b-e)), associated with slight fluctuations of TC , indicating a gradually evolution of the phase structure with increasing dwelling time during TSS. Generally, as the dwelling time gradual increases, the volatilization of alkali elements (K/Na) intensifies, which is summarized by the following reaction :  Similar variations in phase structure were observed in other KNN systems. Furthermore, it has been reported that KNN-based ceramics sintered in a reducing atmosphere can produce oxygen vacancies, which promote a gradual evolution of phase structure. Therefore, we propose that the enhancement of dwelling time under TSS can enhance K/Na volatilization and increase oxygen vacancies, leading to the slight variation of phase structure. SEM morphology of CZ samples under different sintering conditions is shown in. Notably, a slight amount of abnormal coarse grains (\u223c20 \u03bcm) appears in CZ-3 h, which embeds within masses of small grains. Particularly, significantly sustainable growth of small grains is observed when extending the dwelling time up to 6 h in TSS, exhibiting abnormal regions with smaller grains surrounding abnormal coarse grains, which is beneficial to achieve a dense microstructure and improving electrical properties. Additionally, as the dwelling time increases, the maximum grain size continuously increases, and some abnormal grains with considerable coarse grain (\u223c54 \u03bcm) are even found in the CZ-15 h sample. Furthermore, photos of CZ samples show slight color differences, yet all have high densification (>95 %) under different sintering conditions. Therefore, we conclude that the sintering conditions in TSS also have a significant impact on the formation of oversize grains, while a noticeable secondary grain growth is observed in the TSS process. During two-step sintering, the KNN-based samples are heated to a higher temperature (T1) within a shorter time in the first stage, which promotes the formation of recrystallized seeds. In the second stage, the ceramics are rapidly cooled to a lower temperature (T2), promoting the diffusion of grain boundaries under the effect of capillary forces. As a result, the average grain size (AGS) rapidly enhances with the dense arrangement of grain morphologies. To further investigate the relationship between the sintering process and domain structure, the polished and acid-etched domain patterns of CZ specimens under different sintering conditions are presented in. Although a large number of small-sized grains (<5 \u03bcm) and many holes is observed in CZ-3 h due to acid over-etching, large-size watermark and zigzag domains are sporadically observed in oversize grains ((a)). Particularly, a large volume density of domain walls is observed in CZ-15 h, while a mass of hierarchical nanodomains (50\u201370 nm) is observed inside the broad lamellar domain structure (0.8\u20131.8 \u03bcm). The piezo-/ferroelectric properties of CZ samples under different sintering conditions are exhibited in. An interesting phenomenon is that the grain size effect has a significant impact on piezoelectric properties, particularly the d33 of CZ samples increases to more than 400 pC/N, associated with a significant improvement in temperature stability with a dwelling time of up to 6 h ( (a, b)). Subsequently, the d33 gradually increases to 435 pC/N under a dwelling time of 15 h, exhibiting a trend akin to the changes observed in AGS. Additionally, compared with CZ-3 h samples, the ferroelectric hysteresis loops become more saturated, with a slight increase in Pr and electrostrain with increasing dwelling time up to 6 h. This change can be attributed to the promotion of domain reorientation and domain wall motion in coarse grain (discussed in the following text), leading to a superior orientation of the non-180\xb0 domain along the direction of the electric field. Additionally, complex hierarchical nanodomains, large volume density domain of rich R/T/O phase-related subordinate domain features are achieved in CZ-15, slightly enhancing piezoelectricity. Particularly, the grain size increases significantly with a dwelling time of up to 6 h in the second stage of TSS, leading to the construction of R/O/T multiphase coexistence. With increasing the fraction of oversize grain, it realizes a large-sized hierarchical domain architecture (0.8\u20131.8 \u03bcm) with a high-volume density of sporadic nanodomains (50\u201370 nm), resulting in superior piezoelectric properties. In order to clarify the origin of the relationship between the grain size effect and piezoelectric properties, Rayleigh analysis was performed on CZ specimens under different conditions in TSS to quantify the intrinsic and extrinsic contributions on piezoelectric properties ( ), while the applied electric fields should less than Ec/2 to ensure that the domain wall density is unchanged. Rayleigh law can be expressed as follows : where E0 is the level of the applied electric field, dinit is the initial inverse piezoelectric coefficient, which represents the intrinsic contributions from both the inherent lattice distortion and reversible contributions of domain, and \u03b1E0 presents the extrinsic contribution of irreversible domain wall motion. Additionally, the variations of dint and \u03b1 are depicted in (d), showing a rapid increase with extending dwelling time in TSS, which aligns with the changes of d33 and kP. These results indicate that the grain size effect has a significant synergistic effect on both the intrinsic contribution (dint) of polarization rotation and the extrinsic contribution (\u03b1E0) of irreversible domain wall motion, contributing to the enhancement of piezoelectric properties. Notably, the ratio of extrinsic contribution exhibits a similar trend as \u03b1 reaches its maximum at CZ-15 h ((e)), suggesting that the increase in extrinsic contribution plays a significant role in optimizing piezoelectric properties with a dwelling time of up to 6 h in TSS. Meanwhile, the \u03b8max in frequency-dependent impedance spectra represents poling efficiency, while an ideal polarization effect can be realized when \u03b8 reaches nearly 90\xb0. Notably, the \u03b8max significantly increases with the dwelling time up to 6 h , indicating efficient domain switching at the same applied electric field. Therefore, we conclude that KNN ceramics with large grain size obtain superior piezoelectric properties due to the following reasons. This improvement in both intrinsic and extrinsic contributions induce an excellent ferroelectric softening effect (d33=435 pC/N, kp=0.62) and a preferable temperature stability of both piezoelectric properties and electrostrain (d33 retention rate of 84.4 % at 160 \u2103, \u03b7=13.4 % at 200 \u2103) in CZ-15 h ceramic.
