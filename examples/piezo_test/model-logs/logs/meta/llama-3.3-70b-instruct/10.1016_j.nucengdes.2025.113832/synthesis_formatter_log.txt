Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'Diffusion Bonding', 'precursors': ['Pb(Zr_xTi_1-x)O3', 'Ag', 'Ni'], 'steps': ['Screen printing of silver paste on PZT discs', 'Firing at 800°C', 'Coating of nickel wear plates with silver using DC sputtering', 'Heating in flowing hydrogen gas at 700°C', 'Application of additional silver coating', 'Bonding at 275°C or 400°C under 20 MPa pressure for 1 hour', 'Thermal cycling between 250°C and room temperature'], 'characterization_techniques': ['Ultrasonic C-scan imaging', 'Piezometer System', 'Transducer characterization system (TraCSS)']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
