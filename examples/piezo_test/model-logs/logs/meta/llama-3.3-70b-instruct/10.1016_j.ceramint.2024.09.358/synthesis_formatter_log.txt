Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same. If any precursor has industry name or chemical name instead of chemical composition, change it to chemical composition. No need to change the 'steps'.
**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'High-temperature solid-state reaction', 'precursors': ['BaCO3', 'CaCO3', 'ZrO2', 'SnO2', 'TiO2'], 'steps': ['Mixing of stoichiometric ratios of high-purity precursors', 'Grinding in a mortar and pestle for 2 h', 'Milling in an ethanol solution with zirconia balls in a low-energy ball mill for 4 h', 'Drying and pulverization of the resulting solutions', 'Calcination at 1200 °C in air ambient for 4 h', 'Regrinding and molding into disk-shaped pellets with 1 wt % polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as an organic binder', 'Heating at 650 °C for 1 h to burn off the PVA binder', 'Simultaneous sintering at 1400 °C in air for 4 h'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'FE-SEM', 'EDX', 'UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
